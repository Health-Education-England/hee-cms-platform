Haines have heard the same complaints from clients for years; periodic burnout, lack of focus and low energy. So they dug into the latest research on neuroscience, psychology and physiology looking for big answers. Instead they found small answers; proof that small adjustments in daily routines, including thought patterns, food and drink, rest and movement can fight the forces that sap our energy and store focus and drive. They call these amazing efficient restorative techniques 'micro-resilience'. Thousands of men and women from all walks of life have already found effortless ways to incorporate these little changes into the busiest of schedules.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAttention. 0aAttitude (Psychology) 0aGoal (Psychology)1 aHaines, Allen P.,eauthor.08iPrint version :z9780349416274403Kortextuhttps://app.kortext.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login?entityID=https://idp.eng.nhs.uk/openathens&target=https://app.kortext.com/borrow/16480302240nam a2200457 i 4500001000700000003000800007005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066020004300107020003800150020003700188020003700225020001800262040003500280050001100315082001600326100004100342240003600383245010600419250002000525264003200545300007400577336002100651336002800672337002300700338003200723500004500755500010600800504005100906520039600957521001701353588009401370650003801464650004901502650002301551700002701574776003501601856014601636316136StDuBDS20220525203214.0m|||||o||d||||||||cr |||||||||||181001s2019    enka   fob    001|0|eng|d  a9780429769368 (ePub ebook) :cNo price  a9780429429231 (ebook) :cNo price  z9781138368422 (hbk.) :cNo price  z9781138368439 (pbk.) :cNo price  z9780429769368  aStDuBDSbengcStDuBDSerdaepn 4aHD726104a658.3'82231 aMarsh, Timc(Psychologist),eauthor.10aHandbook of organised wellbeing10aOrganised wellbeing :bproven and practical lessons from safety excellence /cTim Marsh, Louise Ward.  aSecond edition. 1aLondon :bRoutledge,c2019.  a1 online resource (xiv, 140 pages) :billustrations (black and white)  atext2rdacontent  astill image2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier  aThis edition also issued in print: 2019.  aPrevious edition: published as Handbook of organised wellbeing.

Resilient leaders are thoughtful and deliberate. They balance logic and emotion, ego and humility. They lead through compassionate empathy by focusing on the 'how', not only the 'what'. They use their influence to drive positive change, diversity and inclusion, and create an equitable community. Most books on resilient leadership appear to focus on spirituality and tools to grow an 'unshakable core of calm, strength, and happiness' or 'bounce back without getting stuck in the toxic emotions of guilt, false guilt, anger, and bitterness'. These books are very similar to handbooks focusing on mental toughness and providing guides for overcoming adversity and managing negative emotions. This book, however, defines resilience as a critical competency of high-performing leaders.  aSpecialized.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed on May 24, 2022). 0aHealth services administration. 0aLeadership. 0aResilience (Personality trait) 2aHealth Services Administration. 2aLeadership. 2aResilience, Psychological.08iPrint version :z9781032042046403Kortextuhttps://app.kortext.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login?entityID=https://idp.eng.nhs.uk/openathens&target=https://app.kortext.com/borrow/134890502331nam a2200397 i 4500001000700000003000800007005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066020004300107020004200150020003800192020003700230020001800267040003500285050002100320082001400341100003100355245011500386264003900501300007300540336002100613336002800634337002300662338003200685500003200717504005100749520077800800588009401578650002801672650003501700650001701735776003501752856014601787350909StDuBDS20220525203213.0m|||||o||d||||||||cr |||||||||||200127s2015    enka    ob    001|0|eng|d  a9781292073699 (ePub ebook) :cNo price  a9781292073682 (PDF ebook) :cNo price  a9781292073675 (ebook) :cNo price  z9781292073668 (pbk.) :cNo price  z9781292073699  aStDuBDSbengcStDuBDSerdaepn 0aBF576b.B43 201504a152.42231 aBharwaney, Geetu,eauthor.10aEmotional resilience :bknow what it takes to be agile, adaptable and perform at your best /cGeetu Bharwaney. 1aHarlow, England :bPearson,c2015.  a1 online resource (xl, 255 pages) :billustrations (black and white)  atext2rdacontent  astill image2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier  aAlso issued in print: 2015.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.8 aPressure, stress and annoying problems are all part of life, especially at work.

Many have undergone huge budgetary cuts as a result, but what are the effects of this intense organisational change on such a large and varied workforce? And how can managers within the public sector meet the challenge of delivering services whilst maintaining the health and well-being of staff tasked with carrying out the work? This work is the ideal companion to any manager in such challenging times. Exploring the realities of working in the public sector, and those factors which can add meaning and purpose to working life, the book provides managers with a toolkit for creating the best working environment, as well as nurturing resilience and motivation within their staff.  aSpecialized.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed on May 24, 2022). 0aHealth facilitiesxPersonnel management. 0aHealth services administration. 2aHealth Services Administration. 2aPersonnel Administration, Hospital.1 aCooper, Cary L.,eauthor.08iPrint version :z9781138929203403Kortextuhttps://app.kortext.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login?entityID=https://idp.eng.nhs.uk/openathens&target=https://app.kortext.com/borrow/22611702197nam a2200445 i 4500001000700000003000800007005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066020004300107020003800150020003700188020003700225020001800262040003500280050000900315060001000324060001300334082001600347100003800363245009600401264003200497300007300529336002100602336002800623337002300651338003200674500003200706504005100738520062000789521001701409588004701426650001301473650003501486650001801521650003101539776003501570856014601605634755StDuBDS20220524143027.0m|||||o||d||||||||cr |||||||||||190814s2020    enka   fob    001|0|eng|d  a9781351050258 (ePub ebook) :cNo price  a9781351050272 (ebook) :cNo price  z9781138485129 (hbk.) :cNo price  z9781138485136 (pbk.) :cNo price  z9781351050258  aStDuBDSbengcStDuBDSerdaepn 0aRT41 0aWY 87 4aWY 100.104a610.7'32231 aTraynor, Michael,d1956-eauthor.10aStories of resilience in nursing :btales from the frontline of nursing /cMichael Traynor. 1aLondon :bRoutledge,c2020.  a1 online resource (vi, 107 pages) :billustrations (black and white)  atext2rdacontent  astill image2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier  aAlso issued in print: 2020.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.8 aIdeas about resilience and identity continue to be promoted, discussed and debated in nursing.

Most importantly, the book offers practical advice on how to avoid burning out and combat the negative effects of an increasingly high-pressure role, exploring how GPs can develop resilience and work in a way that builds a healthier work-life balance. A section is dedicated to the array of GP job options, with testimonies from practitioners working in diverse areas from education and academia to military and humanitarian settings.  aSpecialized.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed on May 24, 2022). 0aPhysicians (General practice) 0aBurn out (Psychology)xPrevention. 2aPhysicians, Primary Care. 2aBurnout, Professionalxprevention & control.1 aLawson, Euan,eauthor.08iPrint version :z9781138066274403Kortextuhttps://app.kortext.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login?entityID=https://idp.eng.nhs.uk/openathens&target=https://app.kortext.com/borrow/21725302401nam a2200397 i 4500001000700000003000800007005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066020004300107020003800150020003700188020003700225020001800262040003500280050002700315082001600342100003000358245008100388250002000469264003200489300003700521336002100558337002300579338003200602500004500634500002800679504005100707520091800758521001701676588009401693650003501787776003501822856014601857241609StDuBDS20220525203215.0m|||||o||d||||||||cr |||||||||||170714s2018    enk    fob    001|0|eng|d  a9781351745321 (ePub ebook) :cNo price  a9781315189178 (ebook) :cNo price  z9780415792899 (hbk.) :cNo price  z9780415792912 (pbk.) :cNo price  z9781351745321  aStDuBDSbengcStDuBDSerdaepn 0aBF698.35.R47bN44 201804a155.2'42231 aNeenan, Michael,eauthor.10aDeveloping resilience :ba cognitive-behavioural approach /cMichael Neenan.  aSecond edition. 1aLondon :bRoutledge,c2018.  a1 online resource (x, 189 pages)  atext2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier  aThis edition also issued in print: 2018.  aPrevious edition: 2009.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.8 aSome individuals emerge from grim experiences stronger in mind and spirit than others who suffered the same ordeal. In this updated and revised edition, Michael Neenan focuses on the meanings we attach to life's adversities in order to understand how we respond to them. This is why different people can react to the same adverse event in a variety of ways such as fighting back or crumbling. Different meanings of what constitutes resilience are also discussed and the author takes issue with the simplistic view of it as bouncing back from adversity which suggests the absence of struggle and emotional pain as well as underestimating how long the process of self-righting can sometimes take. This book shows how people can find constructive ways of dealing with hard times by using the ideas and techniques of cognitive behavioural therapy as well as drawing on the viewpoints and experiences of other writers.  aSpecialized.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed on May 24, 2022). 0aResilience (Personality trait)08iPrint version :z9780415792912403Kortextuhttps://app.kortext.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login?entityID=https://idp.eng.nhs.uk/openathens&target=https://app.kortext.com/borrow/24160902069nam a2200433 i 4500001000700000003000800007005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066020004300107020003700150020003700187020001800224040003500242050002100277082001600298100003300314245013200347250006600479264003200545300003400577336002100611337002300632338003200655500008000687504005100767520026100818521001701079588009401096650003401190650004001224650002301264700004401287700005201331700007101383776003501454856014601489976610StDuBDS20220525203213.0m|||||o||d||||||||cr |||||||||||210504s2021    enk    fob    001|0|eng|d  a9781398601857 (ePub ebook) :cNo price  z9781398601864 (hbk.) :cNo price  z9781398601840 (pbk.) :cNo price  z9781398601857  aStDuBDSbengcStDuBDSerdaepn 0aBF481b.C57 202104a155.2'42231 aStrycharczyk, Doug,eauthor.10aDeveloping mental toughness :bstrategies to improve performance, resilience and wellbeing in in individuals and organizations.  aThird edition /bDoug Strycharczyk, Peter Clough, John Perry. 1aLondon :bKoganPage,c2021.  a1 online resource (288 pages)  atext2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier  aPrevious edition: published as by Doug Strycharczyk and Peter Clough. 2015.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.8 aThis title looks at mental toughness and its application at the organisational level, providing practical guidance on delivering techniques which will improve people's abilities not just to respond to but also to harness the affects of stress and pressure.  aSpecialized.  aDescription based on online resource; title from PDF title page (viewed on May 24, 2022). 0aToughness (Personality trait) 0aPerformancexPsychological aspects. 0aMental discipline.1 aClough, Peterc(Psychologist),eauthor.1 aPerry, John L.c(Sports psychologist),eauthor.1 aStrycharczyk, Doug.tDeveloping mental toughness.sSecond edition.08iPrint version :z9781398601864403Kortextuhttps://app.kortext.com/Shibboleth.sso/Login?entityID=https://idp.eng.nhs.uk/openathens&target=https://app.kortext.com/borrow/97661001684nam a2200373 i 4500001000700000003000800007005001700015006001900032007001500051008004100066020004300107020001800150040003500168050001000203060001100213082001700224100004600241245003500287264003500322300003400357336002100391337002300412338003200435500003200467504004100499520045800540588004700998650002501045650001701070650002501087650001701112776003501129856014601164729953StDuBDS20220524143026.0m|||||o||d||||||||cr |||||||||||160915s2016    enk     ob    000|0|eng|d  a9781409168331 (ePub ebook) :cNo price  z9781409168331  aStDuBDSbengcStDuBDSerdaepn 4aRA782 4aWB 54304a613.1'922231 aDennis, Rebeccac(Health coach),eauthor.10aAnd breathe /cRebecca Dennis. 1aLondon :bOrion Spring,c2016.  a1 online resource (198 pages)  atext2rdacontent  acomputer2rdamedia  aonline resource2rdacarrier  aAlso issued in print: 2016.  aIncludes bibliographical references.8 aBy learning how to consciously connect to our breath and encourage its natural rhythms, we can harmonise the body and mind, live life fully, find emotional freedom and feel empowered.
