Knowledge for Healthcare:  
Learning Space within NHS Knowledge and Library Services in 

England  
 

1. Rationale 

Making the NHS ‘the best place to work’ is a central ambition for the NHS. This is 
based on the recognition that: “To serve our patients and citizens in the best way 
possible we must improve the experience of our people.”(i)  It is therefore essential to 
provide a quality learning environment for staff, learners and educators.  

 
Knowledge and library specialists play a business-critical role in informing learning, 
and workforce development, as well as professional practice, patient care, decision 
making and innovation.  Providing a suitable library environment is equally critical, 

helping staff morale, staff recruitment and staff retention across the organisation. 
Physical library learning space is highly valued by staff, educators and learners, and 
it offers benefits aligned to delivery of NHS organisational priorities. “We must show 
our staff the NHS values them as much as they value their patients.”(ii)   

 
Complementing ‘digital first’ delivery of evidence, library space is a crucial asset to 
address digital poverty, enabling the workforce to build digital skills for day to day  
practice and to underpin a broad range of information skills.   

 
Research shows that library learning space is essential and that creative and 
resourceful uses of this space secures key benefits for the workforce. Users need 
24/7 access to the library and want different learning spaces within it. Survey data 

from 6000 NHS staff, educators and learners corroborates these benefits:  
 

I. Self-directed learning: library as a space for reflection and private study. 
Libraries constitute a pivotal site for managed access to resources and self-directed 

intentional learning and research… the mix of flexible and dedicated spaces offers 
opportunities for concentrated work” (iii) 

 
II. The best place to work: library as a health and wellbeing space. Helping to 

make the NHS the best place to work(i) , library space invites reflection and offers a 
place of sanctuary away from the work environment. This promotes a positive 
workforce culture; supports recruitment, retention and staff development. 
Knowledge specialists provide Wellbeing Guardians(iv)   with evidence, space and 

resources to support staff. They offer wellbeing collections.  
 

III. Collaborative working and learning: library learning spaces for innovation 
and collaboration. Creative use of library space enables “collaboration, interaction 

and tacit knowledge exchange.”(v)  Facilitated by knowledge and library specialists, 
the use of the space, resources and knowledge mobilisation tools, nurtures the 
inception and spread of innovation. 

 

IV. Digital skills and innovation: library as a technology hub. Assisting staff gain 
digital literacy skills and build organisational knowledge and innovation capability to 
deliver more effective healthcare. It provides a safe and trusted environment to 
access e-learning and for experiential learning opportunities through use and

exploration of new and emerging technologies, such as multimedia tools, 
augmented reality, virtual anatomy and 3D printing and hence underpins delivery of 
the Topol Review recommendations. 

 
Knowledge and library specialists provide the expertise in leading these creative 
approaches in the development of the library learning space and in facilitating the 
exploration of new technology by the NHS Workforce. 

 

2. Assuring the quality of the learning environment 
HEE’s Quality Framework sets the standard that NHS providers have a service that 
provides quality services, resources and physical space as part of the learning 

environment to meet the needs of the current and future workforce and educators. 
(Standard 1.5 HEE Quality Framework). HEE’s contract with placement and 
education providers sets out specific requirements including appropriate learning 
space. 

 
3. Design Considerations 
The NHS has a responsibility to provide equity of access and must meet accessibility 
standards and build sustainability into the design of  services. These principles are 

embodied in the Knowledge for Healthcare strategy. Organisations, with their 
Knowledge and Library Specialists, can draw on internationally recognised 
standards(vi) and examples of best practice for library design(vii) to ensure a library 
learning space that enables the innovation and provides the range of different 

learning and well-being spaces required by learners, educators and staff. 
 
4. Policy Recommendations:  
The Executive is asked to approve the following recommendations to NHS 

Providers:  
  
1. The library study and wellbeing space should be available to all staff , educators 

and learners both during and outside the working hours of the k nowledge and 

library services team. 
 

2. The library service space should be developed, managed by the knowledge and 
library services staff, to ensure value through enabling organisational innovation, 

and meeting the changing needs of healthcare staff , learners and educators in 
relation to study and reflection, health and well-being, collaboration, and as a 
technology hub.
