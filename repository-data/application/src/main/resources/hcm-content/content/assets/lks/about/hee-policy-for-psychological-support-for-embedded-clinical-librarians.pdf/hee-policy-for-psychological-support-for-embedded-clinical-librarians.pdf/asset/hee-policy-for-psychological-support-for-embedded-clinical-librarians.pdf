Emotional support for embedded knowledge specialists working in clinical settings:  

Policy recommendations to NHS Employers  

 
Increasingly, NHS organisations are deploying knowledge specialists within clinical settings to bring 
evidence to bear in the ward, and in primary and community care. This aligns to our vision of Knowledge for 
Healthcare that: “NHS bodies, their staff, learners, patients and the public use the right knowledge and 
evidence, at the right time, in the right place, enabling high quality decision-making, learning, research and 
innovation to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.”1 
 
Health Education England’s (2020) recommendations to take incremental steps to improve the staff ratio 
between qualified librarians and knowledge managers per member of the NHS workforce identifies the 
need for more clinical librarian roles to drive improvements in both the quality of care and productivity. 2 
 
RATIONALE 
Our expectation is that the number of embedded roles for knowledge specialists will grow. 
Therefore, it is timely for NHS organisations to review and put in place appropriate mechanisms for 
psychological support for this specialist workforce to ensure their health and wellbeing.  
 
Librarians working in clinical settings report that some situations they witness are distressing. It is a 
challenge for them to know who to approach to talk about what they have encountered. They report 
that inclusion in team debriefs within the clinical department is rare but helpful.  
 
The benefits of team debriefing [*] and clinical supervision are well understood as support 
mechanisms to aid reflection and provide a confidential space to discuss work, with a focus on 
improving practice and patient care.3 Debriefing in the clinical environment enables a whole team 
perspective, supporting both personal and professional needs. 4 
 
A case study of a Schwartz Round for Clinical Librarians illustrates that the emotional impact of 
working with patients should not be overlooked for embedded knowledge and library specialists and 
similar arrangements should be made as those already established for clinical colleagues. 5   
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Executive is asked to approve the following recommendations to NHS provider organisations:  
  

1. NHS organisations ensure that the psychological well-being of librarians and knowledge 
specialists working in clinical environments is considered.  

2. NHS organisations extend existing arrangements for the multi-disciplinary team to include 
clinical librarians and knowledge specialists. 

3. Access to psychological wellbeing services provided within the organisation is highlighted to 
embedded librarians and knowledge specialists working in clinical environments.
