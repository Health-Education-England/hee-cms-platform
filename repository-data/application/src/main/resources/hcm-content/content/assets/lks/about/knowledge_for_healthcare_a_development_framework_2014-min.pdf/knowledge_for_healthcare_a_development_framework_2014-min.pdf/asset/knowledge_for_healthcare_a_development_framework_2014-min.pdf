Knowledge for healthcare: 
a development framework

for NHS library and knowledge services in England

Library and
Knowledge Services

2015 - 2020

“Information will increasingly become the currency of healthcare 
in the future, and our ability to access, understand and interpret it 
at individual and population level will be a key determinant in the 
future success of our healthcare system.” (Framework 15, p.98)

Health Education England leads on developing a flexible NHS 
workforce, open to innovation and change.  It is through 
education, and sharing knowledge, research evidence and best 
practice, that we inspire and inform innovation and improvements 
in patient care and safety, experience and outcomes. To achieve 
these ambitions, individuals must be supported to broaden as well 
as deepen their knowledge. 

Our healthcare knowledge services will nurture a common culture 
of bringing the right knowledge to bear on decisions. Today and in 
the future, these services need to be flexible and active, and offer 
responsive, problem-based, ‘just-in-time’ and ‘just-for-me’ services. 

Health Education England will build on the exemplary record of 
cooperation between healthcare library and knowledge services in 
England and on best practice internationally. We will foster greater 
partnership working between NHS bodies, as well as collaboration 
between library and knowledge services, moving towards one 
coherent service that delivers locally and nationally for patients, 
learners and the healthcare workforce.

Preface to the Framework

Healthcare library and knowledge services are a powerhouse for 
education, lifelong learning, research and evidence-based practice.

Our ambition is to extend this role so that healthcare knowledge 
services become business-critical instruments of informed decision-
making and innovation.

Professor Ian Cumming, 
OBE, Chief Executive

• The population of England will continue 
to grow and older people will make up an 
increasing proportion of that population

• The population will have an increasing 
number of people with long term conditions, 
possibly compounded by environmental 
changes

• At the same time improving technologies and 
treatments contribute to a rising expectation 
of care by the population, coupled with 
increasing knowledge and self-care about 
their conditions

• The NHS workforce is 1.4 million with 
another 1.6 million in social care. The 
workforce will need to be flexible, well-
educated and able to adjust to change

• There are likely to be new roles and ways of 
working, driven by technological changes, 
demographic changes and changing 
expectations.

Framework 15 (Health Education England, 2014) 
is built on our understanding of the global 
drivers of change in healthcare,  an assessment 
of their likely impact on health needs and the 
implications for the healthcare workforce.  
These same drivers impact on our expectations 
for the service delivery model of healthcare 
knowledge services.

As stewards of the country’s investment in healthcare library and knowledge services on behalf of 
the National Health Service, Health Education England is delighted to have instigated the creation of 
this development framework. 

Our framework has been produced to:

• Articulate an ambitious vision through which the outputs and expertise of healthcare library 
and knowledge staff will underpin improvements in patient care and safety, experience and 
outcomes through informed decision-making, and the spread of innovation.

• Invite stakeholders to work with us to transform and optimise healthcare library and knowledge 
services, harness new technologies,  and champion service development and re-configuration, 
thereby extending their reach and  maximising value for money. 

• Guide investment and procurement decisions, the development of new information products, 
partnership working and service modernisation.

• Drive the redesign of roles for healthcare library staff, to improve efficiency and enable the 
adoption of new models of service.

It provides the basis for more detailed conversations with our partners about the challenges and 
opportunities ahead.  It is a framework upon which Health Education England, in dialogue with 
our stakeholders and partners, will build an action plan – with a focus on customer care and value 
for money for taxpayers, achieved through better coordination, collaboration and cooperation, 
including through pooling resources and expertise. 

We invite stakeholders to work with us to achieve shared goals.

1. Introducing the framework

1.1 The changing landscape 
of the health service in 
England



5

Healthcare library and knowledge services underpin all aspects of the 
NHS - supplying the evidence base to the service to make decisions on 
treatment options, patient care and safety, commissioning and policy,  
and to support lifelong learning, undertake research and drive innovation. 

Health information for patients, carers, and the general public is also high 
on the agenda. 

For Health Education England as the system leader of NHS library and 
knowledge services, working in partnership with stakeholders,  these 
services have a key role to play in realising the ambitions outlined in 
Framework 15 and in Health Education England’s Mandate (Department 
of Health, 2014), especially in relation to:

• The importance of information – healthcare knowledge services will  
enable healthcare staff, and the wider health community, to access, 
understand and interpret information at individual and population 
level

• Evidence-based practice - “To continually drive up the standards of 
healthcare, clinical decision making must be supported by the best 
available evidence and good practice.” (Mandate, p. 29)

• Patient expectations – knowledge services will help healthcare staff 

The purpose of healthcare library and knowledge services is to:

Provide knowledge and evidence to enable excellent healthcare and 
health improvement. 

Use the expertise of their staff to ensure that NHS bodies, staff, 
learners, patients and the public have the right knowledge and 
evidence, when and where they need it. 

“to meet the demands of fully informed and engaged patients and 
support and advise patients and carers who are not informed or 
active” (Framework 15, p. 69 )

• The future workforce – healthcare library and knowledge services will 
help to equip healthcare staff with the skills to respond to and adopt 
evidence and innovation to enable whole person care.

2. The pivotal role of healthcare
library and knowledge services



6

• Driving quality improvements through the use of a nationally agreed 
set of standards (NHS England Library Quality Assurance Framework 
(LQAF) England) (Health Education England Library and Knowledge 
Services, 2014a)

• Making a national set of online databases and electronic journals 
available 24/7 to all NHS staff and learners in England (the ‘national 
core content’ collection)

• Embedding knowledge professionals in teams:

- clinical, outreach and commissioning librarians underpin best 
practice and patient care by providing the best available evidence, at 
the bedside and in the workplace

- librarians working with Trust Boards and executive teams answer 
complex strategic and policy questions to inform decision making, risk 
management and governance

• Enhancing physical library spaces to provide modern, flexible learning 
environments

• Launching a national Impact Toolkit (Health Education England 
Library and Knowledge Services, 2014b) for healthcare library and 
knowledge services

• Identifying and spreading library and knowledge service innovation, 
though the national Sally Hernando Awards  

• Implementing practical approaches to better manage organisational 
knowledge, bring people together with knowledge and people with 
people

• Collaborative working to:

- develop and deliver development programmes for library and 
knowledge services staff, 

- create reciprocal document supply schemes in different areas of the 
country, 

- produce current awareness and alerting services.

NHS clinicians and managers will recognise that healthcare library and knowledge services have changed for the better in recent years and there are 
significant successes to share:

The positive impact of NHS library and knowledge services is

Our aim in publishing this framework is to articulate the direction of travel for healthcare library and knowledge services, to inform priorities and 
inform decision-making.   

We are committed to an ambitious vision:

Our vision

NHS bodies, their staff, learners, patients and the public use the right knowledge and 
evidence, at the right time, in the right place, enabling high quality decision-making, 
learning, research and innovation to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.

There is often a large gap between evidence-based treatment guidelines and current 
practice (Nolte and McKee, 2008). Therefore, there is much to do to achieve this vision. 

3. Our vision



10

To ensure a consistent, equitable, funded core service offer to learners and staff, and offer coordinated information to patients and the public, we will 
build and foster effective partnerships nationally and locally. We are committed to learning from and partnering with other NHS  bodies and external 
organisations alike. We will strengthen working relationships across the library community. A coherent approach is needed to deliver our vision and 
optimise investment in products and services  in the best interests of staff, learners, patients and the public. 

This framework provides the basis for those detailed conversations about joint working to address shared opportunities and challenges and we look 
forward to early engagement with a number of key players, including: 

• NHS England – to address and support the information needs of commissioners and policy makers

• Public Health England  – to ensure that the whole public health workforce, whether working at a national or local authority level, has access to 
quality resources and services and that public health information is available to the public and patients

• Department of Health – to develop options for a sustainable funding model for local healthcare library and knowledge services and support Health 
Education England in its implementation

• NICE - building on strong working relationships  to develop a shared agenda - exploring opportunities for greater central procurement of resources 
and to engage with publishers and suppliers, working to promote evidence-based practice

•  NHS Improving Quality – to ensure healthcare knowledge services engage with this important agenda

• Professional and regulatory bodies (including the Royal Colleges, Care Quality Commission, Monitor, NHS Litigation Authority, General Medical 
Council and Nursing and Midwifery Council ) – to endorse the significance of evidence-based practice and embed knowledge into practice

4. Partnerships are central to success



11

Patient satisfaction is linked to the quality of information. Healthcare 
library and knowledge services will work  in partnerships with key 
stakeholders to enrich the information offered to patients and carers, to 
enable people to better manage their health and wellbeing and make 
fully informed decisions about their treatment and care. The importance 
of the public, patients and carers having the right knowledge and 
evidence, when and where they need it, is a significant element of our 
vision. 

Leadership will be required to drive forward a universal offer that ensures 
a joined-up approach to informing patient choice and to engagement to 
promote health and well-being. This will involve working with a number 
of national and local organisations including: 

NHS and third sector organisations – these include NHS Choices, Public 
Health England, Health Watch, Patient Information Forum and health 
charities such as Macmillan, British Heart Foundation and MIND.

Local authorities  -  public health teams, social care, Health and Wellbeing 
Boards and public libraries are all part of local authorities with significant 
responsibilities for delivering health information to patients and the 
public.  

Case study – NHS and public library collaboration to provide 
information for patients and carers

Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has worked 
with Doncaster Public Libraries & Information Service to develop 
a Health & Wellbeing Information Service.  This has included the 
development of a Health Information Training Programme for all 
public library staff and the promotion of a Health Information Enquiry 
Service available to in-patients and out-patients at the hospital and to 
all residents, patients and carers.

Healthcare library and knowledge services are strongly committed to 
collaborative working. More impetus will be given to coordinating robust 
partnerships within and across different sectors.  Key partnerships include:

• Higher education institution libraries  – to take forward a range of 
initiatives including collaboration on procurement of e-resources and 
shared learning on the implementation of new technologies

 
• Independent health libraries – to ensure two-way communication and 

joint working with Royal Colleges, professional bodies and health 
charities

• Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals and 
academic departments of information and library science – to agree 
a shared agenda in the training, development and redesign of the 
future and current NHS healthcare knowledge services workforce

Case study – NHS and higher education collaboration to 
increase access to research journals

The Finch e-journals pilot is an UK-wide National Health 
Service-Health Education collaborative project flowing from 
the recommendations of the Finch report (Working Group on 
Expanding Access to Published Research Findings, 2012).  For one 
year (until 31 March 2015), nine publishers are making academic-
licensed content available to NHS staff, giving access to an 
additional 2,500 journals.  If this project proves successful, our 
ambition is to identify and attract new sources of NHS funding to 
sustain access to these research journals.

5. Shaping our approach

RESEARCH 
– literature search, 

international 
perspectives

ENVIRONMENT 
– policy drivers, 

PESTLE and SWOT

ENGAGEMENT 
– surveys, focus groups, 

interviews



13

Librarians and knowledge specialists routinely engage with both users and non-users of their services principally through staff surveys, gathering a rich 
body of evidence about information needs and preferences and the impact of evidence on healthcare. Drawing on responses from over 17,000 NHS staff 
and nearly 2000 students submitted since 2011, we learned that they primarily use library and knowledge services for patient care, education, research 
and audit. A comprehensive literature review, which drew on 221 UK and international studies published since 2005, verified these findings.

Users value  

• personalised customer service

• expertise and assistance to save time, money and improve patient 
care

• 24 hour and seamless access to both print and full-text electronic 
resources

• literature searches and synthesised, pre-packaged information

• speedy supply of documents

• training to find and evaluate the evidence

• physical space in which to study

• information provision at the point of need by outreach and clinical 
librarians

• access to resources via mobile wireless devices

• experiential learning

Many staff 

• are unaware of healthcare library and knowledge services and 
the benefits for patient care

• are unaware that library and knowledge staff can source 
documents that are not readily available

• experience information overload and lack time to search for 
information

• rely on colleagues and professional networks for information

• are frustrated by technical barriers and issues which they 
experience

• perceive that library and knowledge services are only for use by 
those studying

• make use of general internet search engines to seek to retrieve 
specialised information

5.1 What did NHS staff and learners tell us?



14

Nowadays medicine is evidence based and 
the library service helps me to keep up to 
date

In an evidence based practice environment 
assistance to find the relevant information 
from experienced knowledgeable library 
staff is essential

The cost efficiency of having these 
essential services offered by experts in 
their field is significant

Why should there be a difference in 
journal access for those clinicians who are 
actively involved in research and those 
clinicians that are academics working 
clinically that have access through Higher 
Education?

I think the biggest problem is that 
colleagues in Primary Care are unaware 
that the Library is a resource for 
answering key clinical questions that 
might help with day to day practice

Healthcare scientists are a new staff 
grouping across the NHS and more services 
for these groups as new roles and training 
schemes emerge would be helpful

There always seems to be problems 
logging into Athens… and accessing the 
article is quite confusing

It would be nice to have a podcast 
summary of the latest evidence

Access to library service via smart phone will 
increase usage

The service is one of the Trust’s best assets

Trust network is too slow to support 
e-learning

What I need is electronic access to journals

Libraries need to make more resources 
available electronically to users of mobile 
devices

5.2 NHS staff and learners said…



15

The views of healthcare library and knowledge staff across the NHS were gathered through 
both survey and focus groups. Opinions were gathered on both current delivery, considering 
challenges to be addressed and opportunies as well as future service delivery. 
The key idenfied requirements were:Library and Knowledge Service Leads attended 

several Health Education England Advisory 
Group meetings, and met with Directors of 
Education and Quality, to seek their input on our 
plans to develop a strategic framework. They 
told us that:

• Finding and applying knowledge is an 
important aspect of learning and continuing 
professional development

• Healthcare library and knowledge staff are 
positioned to play a larger role in enabling 
inter-professional learning, assisting with the 
virtual learning environment and developing 
blended training programmes

• It is imperative that we engage with higher 
education institutions, Royal Colleges, 
regulatory bodies and other professional 
organisations to avoid duplication

• Awareness of healthcare library and 
knowledge services is not as widespread as it 
could be across all professions and sectors

• There are perceived barriers that exist 
around access to knowledge resources

• Independent and community staff need to be 
able to access  online resources on a variety 
of platforms, including via mobile devices

Leadership

• Effective leadership at national level
• Equity across geographies
• All NHS organisations have access to 

healthcare library and knowledge services

Transforming the service

• Embedding roles within clinical, 
commissioning and management teams

• Enhanced roles including knowledge 
management and technology enhanced 
learning

• Equity of access to expertise, services and 
resources

• Extend the reach of services
• National purchasing of resources
• Ensure single, reliable and evolving search 

facility
• The use of mobile and point of care tools 

will grow
• Improved IT infrastructure is essential
• Integration of healthcare library and 

knowledge services into clinical systems

Funding

• Commitment to appropriate levels of 
investment

• Sustainable funding model

Workforce

• National standards for staffing levels
• Ensuring healthcare library and knowledge 

services staff have the right skills
• Enhanced career opportunities
• Succession planning

Partnership

• Value and build on existing partnerships 
between NHS library and knowledge services

• More flexible licensing agreements

Quality and impact

• Align the NHS Library Quality Assurance 
Framework with wider quality processes

• Focus on the impact of healthcare library 
and knowledge services on patient care, 
management decisions, commissioning and 
research

5.3 What did HEE Advisory     
Groups and Directors of 
Education and Quality tell 
us? 

5.4 What did library and knowledge staff say?



16

On the basis of all the evidence gathered and lessons learned, the implications for the future of knowledge services are: 

• Access to all services has to be as easy and convenient as possible.

• Services will be digital by default and delivery to mobile devices will be standard practice.

• Services need to be highly visible, pushing quality assured information tailored to specific user needs.

• The clinical and outreach models are expanded to become standard practice.

• Information skills training programmes, augmented by e-learning delivery, should continue to be developed.

• There needs to be a greater focus on synthesising evidence.

• There must be greater emphasis on partnership working.

• There is potential to better align healthcare library and knowledge services with technology enhanced learning initiatives.

• The healthcare library and knowledge workforce requires enhanced skills, including synthesising information, knowledge management, marketing, 
website design and usability testing.

• More sharing and integration of back-office functions is essential to underpin these changes.

Recognising the scale of modernisation required to achieve 
our vision, we identified principles and values on which 
to base decisions, and design criteria for transforming 
healthcare library and knowledge services.

6. Our strategic approach



18

Criteria for the redesign of library and knowledge services

Economy of scale Function can generate economies of scale, offering value for money if delivered at a large scale.

Local knowledge Function requires in depth knowledge of needs of the local health economy and/or strong organisational relationships.

Nationwide functions
Function will benefit from a geographical focus or nationwide leadership to achieve national delivery, and/ or building on 
the foundation of  established regional service/s.

Opportunity for 
standardisation

Function can be delivered using a standardised approach across a wide geography/ number of customers.

Specialist skills
Function requires specialist skills that are scarce and may not be widely available at a local level, or equitably across the 
country.

6.1 Our strategic approach - design criteria



19

We used driver diagrams as a strategic planning tool to:

• explore the factors that need to be addressed in order to achieve our overall goal
• show how the factors are connected
• act as a communication tool
• provide the basis for a measurement framework

Four strategic themes had emerged from our analysis  of all the research 
undertaken and feedback received, and we determined these to be the primary 
drivers for change:

1. Transforming the service – proactive customer-focussed services
2. Transforming the service – quick and easy access
3. Effective leadership, planning and development of the healthcare library 

and knowledge services workforce
4. Optimising funding for best value

7.A Proactive customer-focused services



22

We will undertake a national review of NHS library and knowledge services, making 
recommendations for the reconfiguration and redesign of services to deliver the right 
knowledge and evidence, at the right time, in the right place, enabling high quality decision 
making, learning, research and innovation to achieve excellent healthcare and health 
improvement. 

Much of the development work to achieve a single coherent service that is proactive, and 
customer-focused is already underway. Our focus is on improving, extending, spreading and 
embedding approaches that have been tried and tested over recent years. We have identified 
that a series of interventions are required to deliver customer focused knowledge services.

Our ambition is for healthcare knowledge services to become business critical instruments of 
informed decision-making and innovation, widening their scope to drive the translation of 
knowledge into action across the system. 

NHS staff tell us that they value targeted services including horizon scanning, current 
awareness and automated alerts and briefings that present synthesised evidence.

Case study – KnowledgeShare

NHS staff from all professions and sectors across Brighton and Mid Sussex wanted to receive regular, personalised updates about new high-level 
evidence and policy documents so as to remain informed about the latest developments in their field.

Outcome
The KnowledgeShare system was developed, allowing knowledge services staff to capture the professional interests of thousands of individual staff 
at a granular level. It also enables NHS colleagues to connect with one another based on shared interests.

Impact
Updates provided through the system have informed service-wide decision making, patient education conferences, research bids and the 
development of national guidance. It puts our staff in touch with the evidence and with each other.

7.A.1 Design customer focused services:    
targeted service offers



23

At the centre of successful knowledge management is the right organisational culture – one in which knowledge is valued, and knowledge sharing is 
embedded within day to day working practice. This is not simply a matter of capturing and sharing local successes with pride, but also of acquiring an 
appetite and developing capacity to learn from and invest in the adoption of the best practice demonstrated by other services and organisations.

Mobilising knowledge to deliver on NHS priorities 

Using knowledge to inform healthcare 
policy Embedding best evidence into practice

Developing an organisational memory Supporting innovation 

Making implicit knowledge explicit Meeting the information needs of staff

Horizon scanning; keeping staff up to 
date

Meeting the information needs of 
patients

Knowledge sharing – to spread the 
learning Promoting actionable knowledge tools

Knowledge is a valuable asset that needs to be managed so that healthcare organisations are able to apply knowledge, build know-how and continue 
to learn in order to improve organisational efficiencies and patient outcomes. Knowledge management is a vehicle for organisational development and 
service improvement. It involves deliberate efforts to:

• Turn information into knowledge, making it explicit, usable and available  to answer the right question at the right time in support of  planning, 
policy and guideline development, project work and patient care.

• Bridge the gap between research, policy and practice in order to improve outcomes.

Case study – knowledge retention and 
transfer toolkit

Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust realised 
that when staff left the organisation, knowledge 
about the priorities, contacts, context and 
documents relevant to their posts often went 
with them, making it  difficult for their successors 
to pick up their work in a timely manner.

Outcome 
The Head of Library Services created a  knowledge 
retention and transfer toolkit comprising a 
number of tools and techniques that leavers and 
their managers can use together. 

Impact
The toolkit has been used by a number of 
departments  as people have left the organisation 
or transferred posts, and its use is now an integral 
part of the Trust’s Leaver’s Policy. 

7.A.3 Organisational knowledge management



25

Increasingly, library and knowledge staff will have a greater role as 
knowledge brokers, sharing their expertise in all aspects of the knowledge 
cycle to support NHS staff to find and evaluate the information they need: 

• Define the question.
• Identify knowledge sources.
• Discovery: find the knowledge.
• Evaluate the information.
• Combine knowledge from various sources. 
• Generate and add new knowledge.
• Share knowledge with others; reflect.
• Apply and embed knowledge into action.

There is much to do to develop and improve knowledge management at 
every level – nationally and locally. 

The NHS invests in a range of knowledge management tools such as the 
NHS Atlas of Variation.  Healthcare library and knowledge services play a 
critical role in signposting staff,  both commissioners and clinicians, to raise 
awareness of these tools.  There is also a need to take an overview, and to 
identify gaps. Knowledge staff are ideally positioned to do this.

We are committed to working with partners to produce knowledge 
solutions that can be embodied within decision-making tools (for clinicians 
and patients), and embedded into practice, so that staff adopt best 
evidence, doing the right things right first time.

7.A.5 Deliver customer focused services at the point of need

Case study – anticoagulation monitoring services

The medicines management project team at the Coastal West Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group asked West 
Sussex Knowledge and Libraries to conduct in-depth research to inform commissioning of anticoagulation 
monitoring services in Sussex.

Outcome
The results of their comprehensive review informed the decision to improve the current service rather than 
outsource provision.  The medicines management team gained national recognition for their contribution to 
shaping NICE guidance.

Impact
Commissioners identified the best way to improve quality and save money, and the reputation of the team 
was enhanced.

Case study – neonatal arterial thrombosis 

A neonatal intensive care registrar at the University Hospitals Leicester needed urgent information about 
neonatal arterial thrombosis that would help the baby's parents understand the risks associated with therapies 
as there was a risk to their baby's arm.

Outcome
An urgent and detailed search was carried out by library and knowledge staff at University Hospitals Leicester.

Impact
The baby's parents had the information they needed to consent to the treatment which saved the baby's arm.

“Evidence does not speak for itself but needs to be mobilised at the right time, and through the right people, to make a difference in decision making.” 
(National Institute for Health Research, 2013 p. 11)

Increasingly the NHS will see knowledge specialists embedded within clinical, commissioning and management teams. Delivery of high quality evidence 
in the workplace at the point of need, by professionally qualified knowledge staff, demonstrates significant benefits. NHS staff and learners want to 
receive a personalised service.



27

The work of the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust’s CEBIS (Clinical Evidence-Based Information System) exemplifies the 
beneficial impact of proactive customer-focused knowledge services on therapeutic decisions and patient outcomes, patient experience and safety and 
cost savings. 

Query Findings Outcome Impact

7.A.6 Case study – point-of-need information for clinicians



28

Library and knowledge staff at University Hospitals Morecambe Bay work 
with non-clinical teams to identify products and equipment that work well  
and provide value for money.

The Clinical Librarian was invited to contribute to the Trust Supplies 
Group, convened to consider the research around the clinical efficacy and 
safety of clinical items available for use and make recommendations based 
on clinical and cost effectiveness.

Outcome 
During the past two years the Clinical Librarian has delivered nine critically 
appraised evidence summaries to underpin procurement decisions where 
change to a product may impact upon clinical efficacy.

Impact
The Trust Supplies Group succeeded in meeting their target of £100,000 
savings in year.

7.A.7 Case study – evidence for procurement decisions



29

We will implement a marketing strategy for the provision and awareness of services and resources, raising awareness of knowledge services, 
demonstrating how these are fully aligned to organisational priorities.  It is clear that social media will play a key part in marketing knowledge services. 

Clear and consistent signposting is needed to help the healthcare workforce and learners locate information resources, whilst information skills training 
will remain a key element of the offer from NHS knowledge services. 

The need for information literacy skills to complement clinical 
skills

The Royal College of Nursing identifies a “need for information 
literacy competencies to complement the clinical competence 
framework, helping nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and 
nursing students develop their skills in using information and 
knowledge and apply this to their practice.” (Royal College  of 
Nursing, 2011 p.3)

Promoting awareness of the library service offer
 
Cornwall Health Library Service has  found an effective way to 
promote awareness of the service and its impact is by illustrating 
how the searches that their staff have done over the last three years 
relate directly to helping each of its stakeholder organisations meet 
their  priorities, objectives and targets.

IT – information technology



Services and resources should be ‘digital by default’.  We are 
committed to building on the existing www.libraryservices.
nhs.uk website to develop a single, user-friendly healthcare 
knowledge hub, to enable the NHS to:

• apply knowledge,  build know-how, foster a culture of 
continuous professional development and share learning

• enable access to knowledge management tools
• signpost nationally procured databases, and sources of 

evidence and technology enhanced learning, including a 
link to NICE Evidence services

• promote information literacy
• inform the work of healthcare knowledge staff

In progressing this development, we will build on the legacy 
of prior initiatives in England and seek to benefit from the 
expertise of colleagues in other parts of the United Kingdom 
and internationally. 

31

7.B.1 A knowledge hub for healthcare



32

Utilising the opportunities afforded by 
technology emerged as a consistent theme from 
our engagement with stakeholder groups. 

Enabling timely access to the best sources of up-
to-date, relevant knowledge to inform clinical 
decision making is highly valued, as is the need 
for e-resources to be available remotely , via 
mobile devices, on Wi-Fi , with immediate access 
(including access to ever-more full-text electronic 
resources) at the point of care and need, with 
seamless authentication and navigation, either 
via open-access or free of charge. 

In summary - there is a clear desire across the 
NHS workforce for searching, access to full-text 
and sign-on to resources to be easier,  for access 
to be available via mobile devices, and for IT 
systems to be robust.

We recognise the challenges and the need for 
strong leadership and partnership working 
in this area. We will work with national and 
local partners, including content suppliers, 
to influence and inform strategy, policy and 
investment decisions.

While we cannot be sure of the technical 
solutions that will best serve healthcare 
knowledge services to achieve our vision, we 
can predict that fast-paced advances in new 
technologies and the acceleration of their 
adoption will expand access to information, 
opportunities to personalise and embed 
information, provide tools for collaboration 
– and require knowledge services staff to 
continually develop their awareness and skills. 
(Varnum, 2014)

Our strategic approach will also reflect trends 
in publishing  - in particular the gradual move 
away from subscription-based models towards 
Open Access publishing, which provides free 
online access to peer-reviewed research.  
Publishers recognise the demand for synthesised 
evidence and summaries of research results. The 
sheer increase in volume of published content, 
requires ever more sophisticated methods of 
filtering content and ‘mining’ data to find 
reliable quality evidence. 

7.B.2 Optimising use of new technologies; 
reflecting trends in academic publishing



33

A national portfolio of electronic information resources, known as 
“national core content” has been made available to the whole healthcare 
workforce for over 10 years.  This has yielded benefits in terms of equity of 
access and cost savings, on which we will build going forward.

Key steps now are:

• Scaling up the procurement of electronic resources from local to 
national level, to achieve better deals with publishers and suppliers.

• Exploring the feasibility of setting up an open access repository for 
the NHS in England, to showcase NHS-funded research activity and to 
meet the requirements of the government-endorsed Finch report on 
expanding access to published research findings. (Working Group on 
Expanding Access to Published Research Findings, 2012) 

• Streamlining the management of these resources, by establishing a 
single, centralised e-resources team. 

“Through participation in the national collaborative procurement 
of bibliographic databases and electronic journals, we have 
calculated that the London Health Libraries network has realised 
savings of around 50%, compared with the cost of purchasing the 
same resources at regional or local level”.

Richard Osborn
Strategic Lead for Library Services and eLearning
London

7.B.3 Management and procurement of e-resources



34

There are significant opportunities to harness technology, to streamline internal functions, in order to improve efficiency and so release time to prioritise 
customer-facing services.

We will oversee a review of healthcare library and knowledge service back-office functions to determine where improved automation, more consistent 
use of technology and centralisation of services will result in benefits to NHS staff and learners while improving performance of knowledge services. 

Case study – a library network covering three Local Education and 
Training Board areas in the south of England

The healthcare library services in South West, Thames Valley and 
Wessex share a centrally hosted library management software 
system, and have built a single library service network, with the 
following benefits:

• Staff, trainees and students can search the holdings of all 
the healthcare libraries in the region (over 100) via a single 
catalogue, whilst a single library membership card enables them 
to use any of the services in the network, as they move between 
posts and placements

• Shared processes and policies have been developed, helping to 
ensure equitable services for staff and students, wherever they 
are based within the network, and saving time for individual 
library teams

• The Trusts within the network do not need to pay for and 
maintain separate software systems for managing local library 
functions, resulting in considerable cost savings

7.B.4 Streamline library and knowledge service functions



35

There is a significant opportunity to rationalise, share information 
products, and standardise approaches across the country, ensuring 
that work is only done once.  We are committed to reviewing existing 
document delivery schemes and exploring opportunities to further extend 
these, and have identified a number of business critical products which 
could be developed collaboratively for local customisation and delivery. 
These include:

• Marketing and promotional initiatives.
• User guides.
• Training materials.
• Current awareness and alerting services

Case study – collaboration in the production of horizon-
scanning bulletins in North West England

Library and knowledge staff in the North West have collaborated to 
create a series of over 20 horizon scanning bulletins covering clinical 
and management topics. Each librarian takes responsibility for a 
particular bulletin which is published monthly on the internet and 
shared with library and knowledge services across the North West, 
so that each can in turn distribute them to their local service users. 
This reduces duplication, makes the best use of staff time, ensures 
consistent quality, and helps keep clinical staff and managers across 
the area updated.

7.C Effective leadership and planning and development 
of the knowledge service workforce



37

Many of the healthcare knowledge staff we will have tomorrow are part of the current workforce. The services that they provide are rightly valued by 
learners and staff alike. Locally, librarians and knowledge specialists often lead in adopting new technologies and media, and use their experience to 
teach others to access, evaluate and apply knowledge.

Focused on NHS priorities, new  models of service delivery call for flexible, multi-skilled knowledge specialists confident to apply their expertise within 
healthcare teams and at points of care and decision-making.  Accordingly, investment in the continuing professional development of the existing 
healthcare library and knowledge workforce is essential.  Now, and going forward, many more responsive, problem-based, ‘just-in-time’ and ‘just-for-
me’ services are needed. The principles that we  have set out shape our workforce development agenda by signalling the skills and experience that will 
be important.

To turn the rhetoric of our vision into reality requires the 
establishment of a national, strategic professional lead for 
healthcare library and knowledge staff to inspire and sustain the 
implementation of this development framework. We will initiate a 
review of the existing structures and shape a robust leadership model 
that also:

• recognises the requirement for geographically focused and more 
local professional leadership to head up local healthcare  library 
and knowledge services networks, engage with local partners and 
crucially to ensure the strategic framework is turned into action 
and 

• bolsters collegiate working, while streamlining decision-making 
structures; avoiding wasteful  duplication and optimising 
specialist skills.

7.C.1 Effective leadership and planning and development 
of the knowledge service workforce



38

Healthcare knowledge services must be professionally led to ensure the right expertise and experience is deployed to maximum effect.  Collaborative 
working across England is central to making the best use of the available expertise within this small specialised workforce. Together, we will drive up the 
quality of healthcare library and knowledge services to enhance outcomes and the experience of staff and learners by working in a collegiate style, as a 
single team within Health Education England.

We propose a national lead supported by geographically focused professional teams with responsibility both for specific national functions and for 
ensuring local stakeholder engagement.

Key elements of the national professional 
lead role:

• Strategic thinking and action planning
• Working with strategic partners
• E-resources procurement and contract 

management
• Developing quality assurance systems
• Managing funding streams
• Programme and change management
• Supporting consumer health 

information national programmes
• Team building and people motivation
• Leading innovation

In addition to a  programme manager to drive the work forward nationally, each of the 13 LETBs should have a senior lead responsible for knowledge 
services, including healthcare libraries and Technology Enhanced Learning. 

Key elements of the LETB role:
 
• Leading and co-ordinating local 

knowledge service networks (inclusive 
of libraries and Technology Enhanced 
Learning)

• Implementing a quality assurance 
programme to accredit healthcare 
knowledge services

• Delivering continuous professional 
development

• Providing strategic advice and 
professional leadership to NHS 
organisations and healthcare library and 
knowledge staff

• Local partnership working
• Project management
• Supporting local consumer health 

information initiatives

7.C.2 Healthcare knowledge services leadership     
- at national and LETB level



39

Managers of healthcare library and knowledge services in 
Trusts and other NHS bodies such as Clinical Commissioning 
Groups and Commissioning Support Units all require 
excellent leadership skills.

Local leaders will need to be identified, nurtured and 
developed through programmes that focus on the skills 
required and these in turn will feed in to a more rigorous 
approach to succession planning.

Key elements of a local role:

• Planning and implementing local knowledge services 
strategies

• Engaging with senior staff to champion the role of 
knowledge services within the organisation

• Leading knowledge needs analysis on which to design, 
deliver and monitor healthcare knowledge services

• Effective management of resources including funding, 
staff, and physical space

• Identifying best practice and innovation to modernise 
healthcare library and knowledge services delivery

• Assessing the impact the service has on patient care and 
the core business of the organisation

Our ambitions

• Establish a national workforce planning 
process:

	 	 Complete a workforce review, identify 
   key issues and, recognising that this is 
   an ageing workforce, address
   succession planning
	 	 Establish a national workforce survey 
   plus a  regular survey of development 
   needs
	 	 Set national priorities for ongoing  

  training to meet the needs of future  
  service delivery

• Up-skill staff to apply lean thinking, 
streamline systems and processes, and 
create and share information products to 
deliver equitable, efficient and effective 
services

• Empower knowledge staff to drive and 
deliver our vision by fostering innovation 
and service development, through role 
enlargement, role enhancement and role 
substitution

• Up-skill our paraprofessional staff, 
expanding their roles to take further 
responsibility in supervisory work, customer 
care and oversight of back-office functions

7.C.3 Centralised service and 
product development

7.C.4 Changing the profile of the healthcare 
library and knowledge services workforce



40

Our ambition is to align the healthcare library and 
knowledge workforce to NHS and organisational priorities, 
through service redesign and workforce development, 
focused on where the service can make most impact on the 
improvement of healthcare:

• Role enhancement and enlargement will create new 
roles for librarians that focus on informing decision-
making and translating knowledge into action

• Product and service development will build on the 
learning from exemplars. By extending these and 
piloting new approaches, knowledge services  will 
extend their reach

• The range of healthcare library and knowledge roles 
is diverse, encompassing research, management and 
technical skills

• Technology is moving rapidly. It presents exciting 
opportunities that shape ongoing training and 
development needs

There will be exciting opportunities for library and 
knowledge staff to innovate, enlarge and extend their 
roles. Working collaboratively within multi-disciplinary 
teams, and with other information providers, to aggregate 
information,  knowledge brokers will enhance their 
skills and contribute their expertise to the production, 
management and mobilisation of knowledge in the local 
context. 

Investment in the continuing professional development of the existing healthcare 
library and knowledge workforce is essential. To make the greatest impact on 
health improvement we will establish both a competency framework that defines 
core and specialist competencies, and a national training programme to address 
skill gaps.

Research shows that library and knowledge staff see the following skills as 
essential: communications, people and project management; personal qualities 
of intellectual versatility and perseverance; health literacy; great customer care; 
specialist skills to drive evidence-based practice, enable knowledge management 
and support guidelines development; enhanced technical skills from robust 
synthesis to document management, procurement to costing, and data mining. 
(Sen, Villa and Chapman, 2014) 

We will build a detailed profile of the healthcare library and knowledge services 
workforce. Steps must be taken to shape career pathways for this speciality and 
to improve staff recruitment and retention.  Given that the relative proportion 
of  experienced senior healthcare library and knowledge staff is falling, there is a 
pressing need for effective succession planning and talent management.

Alongside innovative workplace and health-economy wide initiatives, self-directed  
personal and professional development learning are key.  Service improvement 
projects, skills-sharing and networking, shadowing and mentoring are as important 
as onsite tailored training and externally facilitated events. 

As the service is modernised, greater investment will be needed to support the 
development of  first contact healthcare knowledge service assistants (staff in 
bands 2-4).

7.D Optimising investment in knowledge services



42

Healthcare library and knowledge services 
funding is historically complex, characterised 
by a relatively high dependency on 
postgraduate medical education funding, 
and variable levels of investment by 
employers.  

The total annual investment in healthcare 
library and knowledge services is in the 
region of £51m. The largest element of this 
spend is on staff, followed by knowledge 
resources (databases, journals and books, 
increasingly in electronic format). Of this 
investment 89% is made by local NHS 
organisations, and 11% is made by Local 
Education and Training Boards (LETBs).

Our ambitious vision can only be realised by 
making our finite resources go further and 
make more impact, and improve quality by 
reducing inappropriate levels of variation.

Expert knowledge support and study space must necessarily be provided locally, but to complement this local provision, we will exploit the potential for 
doing more just once, and sharing the outputs for the benefit of all.  Leadership for ‘do once and share’ initiatives may rest at national, geographical or 
at Local Education and Training Board level.  

With the establishment of Health Education England as the lead body with responsibility for NHS library and knowledge services, we will take advantage 
of the unique opportunity to start to pool budgets and make strategic and collaborative investment decisions, initially in relation to the 11% of total 
investment made currently made by Local Education and Training Boards, and with a focus on increasing collaborative procurement of electronic 
knowledge resources, to achieve larger discounts and improve equity of access.  

This will not be without challenge, because of the large current variation in healthcare library and knowledge services budgets at Local Education and 
Training Board level. Equity of access and opportunity is one of our key guiding principles and only by pooling resources can we start to leverage system-
wide improvement.

There is clear potential to further streamline services and improve efficiency at local level, by harnessing technology to streamline ‘back-office’ functions, 
and through greater collaboration between services. 

Recognising the challenges of rationalising funding at local level, we will nevertheless take steps to realise our ambition to introduce an equitable, 
affordable and sustainable funding model for local healthcare knowledge services.

Initially this will involve: 
• exploring options for pooling library and knowledge services funding to support shared services
• facilitating more collaborative purchasing and resource sharing
• contributing to national work to establish education reference costs
• working with employers to ensure they make a proportionate investment in knowledge services for their staff
• ensuring that Learning and Development Agreement quality monitoring processes are robust and reflect our strategic principles

We will commission a study of return on investment in 
healthcare library and knowledge services for the NHS in 
England. Comparable services in several other countries 
have already published evidence to demonstrate how 
investment in library and knowledge services delivers cost 
savings for health care systems. (HLWIKI International, 
2014) 

In addition to rationalising investment and working 
to demonstrate value for money, we will engage with 
strategic partners who share a stake in ensuring that the 
staff of NHS bodies, learners, patients and the public have 
access to and use best knowledge and evidence, to explore 
further opportunities to optimise investment.

Worth every cent and more

An independent assessment of the return on investment 
of health libraries in Australia found that they return $9 
for every $1 invested.

The results took into account time saved by medical 
practitioners in searching for answers, and how much 
it would cost healthcare staff to buy information they 
gain free from the library.

Limited collaborative working  or shared 
investment amongst the different national 
organisations  with a stake in ensuring that the 
staff of NHS bodies, learners, patients and the 
public access and use knowledge and evidence.

Healthcare library and knowledge services funding 
at local level is unevenly distributed and uncertain.

An equitable, sustainable funding model  for local 
healthcare knowledge services, which reflects that 
to fulfil their purpose and vision, they must be 
multi-disciplinary, support staff as well as learners, 
and service as well as education.

Highly variable levels of investment by employers 
in provision of healthcare library and knowledge 
services for their staff and learners.

Recognising the value and impact of healthcare 
knowledge services to their core business, all 
employers across all sections of the NHS will make 
a proportionate financial contribution to the cost 
of ensuring that staff and learners access and use 
knowledge and evidence.

Only £2 million of the total £50 million annual  
investment in healthcare library and knowledge 
services is spent collaboratively (on central 
procurement of e-resources).

A much higher proportion of  spend will be made 
strategically and collaboratively,  to ensure that 
finite funding delivers best value and impact.

We have identified the following metrics for measuring success, to be achieved within three years. These metrics will be reviewed and additional 
meaningful measures introduced as part of action planning to implement the strategic framework.

Increase in evidence of impact
• Increase in use of the refreshed Impact Toolkit: used by 95% of 

services

Increase in quality
• Proportion of library and knowledge services over 90% compliant 

with NHS Library Quality Assurance Framework: 98%

Increase in use 
• Increase the proportion of staff in four target groups (medical and 

dental; nursing and midwifery; allied health; scientific and technical) 
using NHS-funded knowledge resources and services:  by 20%

• Across the whole NHS workforce, increase the number of staff using 
NHS-funded knowledge resources and services: by 10%

Improvements in service offer
• Increase in proportion of knowledge services with clinical/outreach 

librarians: from 58% to 80%
• Increase in production and use of nationally-produced horizon 

scanning bulletins: 25% increase in Year 1; 10% in Years 2 and 3

Improvements in knowledge services workforce development
• Define and publish core and specialist competencies (then set 

ambitious targets to increase the proportion of staff with these)

Optimised investment
• Double the amount of investment in national, collaborative 

procurement of e-resources

7.E Delivering the vision: metrics for success

The NHS Library Quality Assurance Framework 
(LQAF) England enables robust quality 
assessment of healthcare library and knowledge 
services. It provides a clear focus for action 
planning across all NHS organisations, steering 
local quality improvement plans by setting 
direction for service managers.  

Health Education England monitors compliance 
with the Framework and the reports issued 
provide a transparent benchmark of areas of 
development required to meet business and 
client need. We will refresh the Library Quality 
Assurance Framework to ensure it continues 
to drive service improvement and is aligned 
with wider education and service monitoring 
processes.

Data from LQAF show an overall improvement in 
quality across the country (2011- 2013). 

As part of our commitment to quality, 
knowledge teams will continue to undertake 
and publish  research in the field, thereby 
building the evidence base for service 
improvement and sharing best practice.

8 Improving quality and demonstrating impact



49

Through this development framework for the future of 
healthcare knowledge services, we have demonstrated the 
ways in which they make a positive impact on patient care by:

• providing information to support evidence-based patient 
care including treatment decisions

• informing commissioning decisions
• guiding service development decisions
• supporting guideline and pathway development

Feedback also illustrates the value that students and staff place on the 
services provided to support education, training and continuous professional 
development. 

Our Impact Toolkit is a comprehensive resource and has a solid academic 
foundation. It provides a template for gathering qualitative and quantitative 
evidence to demonstrate the value of knowledge services to the NHS.  Our  
next steps are to refresh the tool, promote widespread adoption and publish 
case studies in order to attract more decision-makers to make best use of these 
services.

Availability of the library and the 
resources have been pivotal to my 
professional development. If it had 
not been for the knowledge and 
support available, I would not be 
where I am today as a nurse specialist

Nurse Specialist, Isle of Wight NHS 
Trust

Thank you for all your help 
this year. It has made a 
massive difference to my 
course to have access to 
a library that has been so 
supportive. 

Student Nurse, 
Buckinghamshire Healthcare 
NHS Trust

I went to the library training session with little knowledge and 
confidence. I am now carrying out thorough literature searches and very 
confident doing them.
