Every day more than a million decisions are 
made across the NHS and healthcare sector. 
Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, 
there is a responsibility for health services to 
ensure use of evidence obtained from 
research. 

#amilliondecisions is a new campaign from 
CILIP and Health Education England calling for 
decisions in the healthcare sector to be fully 
evidence based, highlighting improvements in 
quality of care, patient experience and cost 
effectiveness when healthcare providers and 
their teams work closely with health librarians 
and knowledge specialists. Specialist librarians bring the 

evidence to inform good healthcare 
decision-making. Find out more and 

pledge your support.  

"We needed to present in-depth evidence around 
options that will reduce costs in both the acute 
sector and primary care, and to evaluate a range of 
innovative service models in psychological therapy 
for long-term conditions.  

Having access to a dedicated library and knowledge 
service negated the need for us to spend time on this 
and ensures we can confidently and competently 
ensure that those with a long-term condition can 
benefit from a psychological intervention".

Reduction in cost of treating long-term
