Health Librarians:  
Making a Difference

Library and
Knowledge Services

I can’t imagine doing a 
job as a librarian which I’d 

enjoy more or find more rewarding. 
I feel privileged to contribute to 
improving patient care”

Richard Brook, Clinical Librarian



Working in health libraries is varied, stimulating and 
rewarding. Health librarians run complex literature searches 
and horizon scan to support patient care, research, and 
improvements in health services. They develop and deliver 
training to help health professionals assess and make the  
best use of evidence. Many roles are embedded with health 
and management teams. Here are some examples. 

Clinical Librarians
Clinical Librarians aim to spend as little 
time in the library as possible and as 
much as they can out and about in the 
hospital working alongside clinical teams 
as they care for patients. 

They accompany, and are part of, multi-
disciplinary teams including doctors, 
nurses and therapists on ward rounds as 
they visit patients. They look for evidence 
gaps and uncertainties, and find answers. 

Outreach Librarian
The Outreach Librarian works with any 
NHS staff working in the community, 
often providing Library and Knowledge 
Services remotely. The users they work 
with range from GPs, through student 
nurses and paramedics, to the IT 
manager. They visit GP practices and 
community health centres to promote 
resources and provide training. The 
requests for information or support are 
varied and can be complex. They may 
be asked for evidence for writing local 
policies, answering patients’ questions,  
or professional development.

The role is incredibly 
rewarding. It keeps 

me constantly learning and 
growing in my role. I build 
relationships with organisations 
and individuals that allows 
me to support them in their 
information needs.”

Holly Case

A recent search 
was turned 

around in less than 
three hours, and the 
clinicians commented 
that ’This search…  

was used directly used to inform a 
patients care and importantly, to counsel 
the family on a topic that they had 
wanted us to look into further. It was 
such a prompt response that enabled  
this to be useful’”

Public Health and 
Commissioning Librarians
These librarians provide evidence-based 
knowledge and information and current 
awareness services to local Public Health 
teams (in the local council) and Clinical 
Commissioning Groups (CCG). CCGs 
decide what clinical services need to 
be provided in an area, and which 
organisations will be paid to provide 
them. Librarians working with CCGs 
provide evidence to support local 
pathways of care. CCG staff also have  
a need for statistics and case studies  
from other CCGs. 

Public health teams require information 
at population level. This can be very 
different from the clinical care of 
individual patients.

Every week is different. Working onsite 
means the librarian is immersed in the 
public health or commissioning team  
and their work. 

Academic Health Science 
Network (AHSN) Liaison 
Librarian
The AHSN promotes research and 
collaboration between the NHS, higher 
education and industry. This role involves 
developing relationships, conducting 
complex literature searches, providing 
reviews or summaries of the evidence, 
performing regular horizon scans for 
new technologies and innovations, and 
profiling NHS organisations to identify 
common themes and issues. 

I’ve had to learn 
new search 

skills and track down 
new resources to use, 
as well as get in to 
the mind-set of Public 

Health practitioners and Commissioners.”

Having a physical presence 
is beneficial… I get to 

know the people and the context 
of their work, so have a deeper 
understanding of what their 
information needs are.”

Frankie Marcelline

It’s a very 
stimulating  

job, no two searches  
or reviews are the 
same. I have had some 
great feedback and 

knowing that the work I do is helping  
to inform initiatives across the patch  
is very rewarding.”

Library and Knowledge 
Services Manager
Service Managers have the autonomy 
to shape the service to meet the needs 
of their customers. They not only write 
their own development strategies, but 
get involved in shaping national strategy. 
They lead a small, diverse team, so they 
keep contact with their users and can  
see the difference their service makes.

The Healthcare Professional Knowledge 
and Skills Base (PKSB for Health) can 
be used to support workforce planning 
at local, regional and national level. 
Employers and line managers will use 
it to aid their understanding of the 
competencies required of library and 
knowledge services staff and to inform 
role and service redesign, and support 
the recruitment and retention of staff. 
We want it to be used by individuals in 
developing their personal development 
plans, as part of the process of gaining 
professional registration and revalidation 
by the Chartered Institute of Library and 
Information Professionals (CILIP). 

The Learning Zone signposts librarians to 
key online resources to underpin personal 
and professional development – all the 
resources are open to anyone to use on

Knowledge for 
Healthcare
Knowledge for Healthcare (HEE 2014) 
is the framework for the development 
of health libraries across England 2015–
2020. Multiple work streams involving 
health librarians and partners are working 
on its implementation. The librarian 
workforce is central to our strategy  
and a number of resources have been 
published this year to underpin their 
personal and professional development  
as well as help employers understand 
what it is we do!
