Patient and Public Information

Knowledge for Healthcare Vision statement:

NHS bodies, their staff, learners,  patients and the public   
use the right knowledge and evidence, at the right time, 
in the right place, enabling high quality decision-making, 
learning, research and innovation to achieve excellent 
healthcare and health improvement.

There is a real need for patients and the public 
to have access to high quality, reliable health 
information. As patients are being encouraged to 
self-manage and be partners in their care, they 
need access to a range of resources tailored to 
their literacy level.

Healthcare librarians and knowledge specialists 
are uniquely positioned to work with partners to 
support healthcare staff to deliver improvements 
in public health and to ensure that patients, carers 
and families can access the information they need. 

During 2015/6, the PPI Working Group developed 
Guidance and an Ideas Bank to support library 
staff as they develop services for these groups. 

As the work of the PPI Working Group continues in 
2016/7, three key priorities have been identified to 
continue to deliver this aim: 

;; Increase the confidence and capability of 
healthcare library and knowledge services staff 
to train and support the healthcare workforce 
and collaborate with other information providers 
to signpost, evaluate and use health and 
wellbeing information.

;; To equip and support healthcare staff to 
signpost and use high quality health and 
wellbeing information and to share guidance on 
evaluating information.

;; To equip and support information providers in 
the public and third sectors to find, signpost 
and use high quality health and wellbeing 
information and to share guidance on 
evaluating information.

There are some great ideas in the

guidance about how we can work better 

to support patients and the public.”

Ideas Bank of best practice

Guidance

Look at the Ideas Bank on best practice, 
innovations and case studies to help develop  
your service, for example: 

Case Study on: Providing sessions to 
patients on safe health information 
websites. As part of the National Cancer 
Survivorship Initiative, library staff at Taunton  
and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust attend well-
being sessions held at community venues. They 
engage with patients, their families and carers 
by encouraging them to access websites which 
display quality standards, such as the Information 
Standard, for their health information. They 
also give simple website appraisal advice using 

the mnemonic WWW (who, what and where). 
There is a leaflet for patients that has now been 
adopted by the Trust as a core part of every 
patient information stand. 

These sessions have also been requested by 
healthcare staff in other areas for their patient 
support groups.

I love the Ideas Bank - just brilliant.”

I think the vignettes are a good way

of helping services to see what might be 

realistic and achievable in the different 

aspects of service.”
