and employers

The Professional Knowledge and Skills Base for Health is available here:    
www.libraryservices.nhs.uk/pksb and for CILIP members at www.cilip.org.uk/pksb 

The Professional Knowledge and 
Skills Base (PKSB) was developed by 
the Chartered Institute of  Library 
and Information Professionals 
(CILIP) in the United Kingdom 
following extensive consultation 
with employers, the library, 
information and knowledge 
community and learning providers. 

Health Education England (HEE) and 
CILIP are working together to help 
the health sector develop the library 
and knowledge service workforce 
needed for the 21st century.

The PKSB for Health can be used in a 
number of  ways:

•	 It	outlines	the	broad	spectrum	
of  knowledge and skills that are 
required across the profession.

•	 It	is	a	self-assessment	tool	for	
individuals to use in planning their 
personal development, and as 
part of  the process of  gaining 
professional registration and 
revalidation by CILIP. 

•	 It	can	be	used	to	demonstrate	
our unique skill set to employers.  
They can use it to enhance their 
understanding of  the competencies 
required of  librarians.

•	 Employers	will	use	it	to	inform	
role and service redesign as well 
as staff  training, and so to support 
staff  recruitment and retention. 
Healthcare managers can use it 
with staff  as part of  the appraisal 
process, and in talent management 
conversations.

•	 Employers	and	Library	and	
Knowledge Service Strategic Leads 
will use it to support workforce 
planning	and	development	-	at	local,	
regional and national level.

Introducing the Professional and Knowledge 
Skills Base for Health

The PKSB for Health outlines the broad range of  skills required by librarians and 
knowledge specialists working in health. It enriches the PKSB with the addition 
of  examples from a health setting throughout.



It is made up of  the following elements:

Ethics and values are placed at the 
centre of  the wheel as they underpin 
the work of  practitioners in the sector. 
The attitudes and behaviours expected 
of  all health sector staff  are also set out.

Professional expertise and 
generic skills are the key sets of  
knowledge and skills which make our 
profession unique. 

Each heading is broken down into 
further detail; each section having 
between 6 and 10 further knowledge 
and skill headings.

Professional expertise and generic 
skills have been set within the 
wider library, information and 
knowledge sector context and 
the wider organisation and 
environmental context because 
it is important for practitioners 
to maintain current awareness 
and understanding of  the wider 
profession and have a good 
knowledge of  the world outside 
their own workplace.

The PKSB for Health has been 
designed	as	a	practical	self-assessment	
tool. This means you can carry out 
self-assessment	of	your	knowledge	
and skills against all areas. To help with 
this	CILIP	have	developed	a	set	of	self-
assessment ratings. The descriptions 
of  the ratings are included within the 
full tool available on the website.

The descriptions of  the ratings will 
help you consider your level of  
knowledge and skills in each area 
and identify areas that you might 
want to develop as part of  your own 
continuing professional development.

There is no expectation that an 
individual will have the same level 
of  knowledge and skills across the 
whole of  the Professional Knowledge 
and Skills Base for Health. The level 
of  knowledge and skills will vary 
depending on your role. 

Consider using the comments box 
to provide evidence of  your level 
of  knowledge or skills in the health 
sector or areas that you feel you 
need to develop. You could also add 
in additional levels of  detail which 
are relevant to your role. This is your 
tool; it is up to you how you fill it in. 
You don’t need to have it assessed by 
CILIP, HEE or your employer.

Using it as a self-assessment 
tool

Self-assessed	ratings	can	be	added	
&	saved	-	an	explanation	of	the	
ratings are contained in the full 
online version. 

Comments and 
details of  goals and 
achievements can be 
added and saved in 
the interactive pdf. 



Using the Professional 
Knowledge and Skills Base 
to get a job

We encourage you to contact people 
in the kind of  role that you want  
to do. Read Knowledge for 
Healthcare, HEE, 2014 at bit.ly/
Knowledgeforhealthcare to 
understand the strategic direction. 
Look at job adverts, job descriptions 
and the related person specifications 
and think about what employers 
are looking for. This will help you to 
analyse areas in which you may want 
to develop.

There are many opportunities to 
develop your knowledge and skills 
in the health sector. Get involved in 
health library networks, join CILIP 
Health Libraries Group and regional 
member networks. These provide 
great opportunities to network and to 
develop skills.

and skills.
