Need to prove the value of your service?

Use the Value and Impact Toolkit

The Value and Impact toolkit provides resources 
for health library and knowledge services to 
demonstrate their essential role in the provision  
of safe, effective and efficient evidence based  
care in the modern health service.

A series of robust tools are provided to assist 
library and information professionals in obtaining 
evidence of impact from their customers including:

;; A new short questionnaire

;; An interview schedule

;; A revised case study template

The questionnaire invites responders to report on a 
range of possible impacts including CPD, research, 
education, and service development as well as any 
impacts on patient care.

Knowledge for Healthcare

What are you measuring - and for whom?

Library staff can often find themselves collecting 
information unsuited to their needs when obtaining 
feedback from customers. The resource provides a 
mapping feature to assist in the selection of the best 
tool for their requirements in a specific situation.

A range of other carefully selected methods 
and tools used to measure value and impact are 
included within the toolkit.

A list of the definitions adopted in the work are 
also included within the toolkit for reference 
together with a bibliography.

If you have any comments or wish to recommend 
further resources for inclusion please contact:
