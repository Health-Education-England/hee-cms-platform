Funding NHS Knowledge and Library Services in England  

Policy guidance for NHS employers 

 
RATIONALE 
 
Healthcare is a knowledge intensive industry. The Health and Social Care Act 2022 places duties in 
respect of research upon the Secretary of State (p45, S40) and therefore upon the health service as a 
whole, that organisations in the exercise of their functions: “must facilitate or otherwise promote –   
 

(a) research on matters relevant to the health service, and  
(b) the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research.”  
 

As strategic lead for knowledge and library services on behalf of the system, Health Education 
England (HEE) is committed to working with organisations to ensure that knowledge and library 
services have the right resources to offer the right services. It is through education, and sharing 
knowledge, research evidence and best practice, that the NHS inspires and informs the delivery of 
high-quality healthcare.  NHS knowledge and library services are crucial to unlocking this value, 
informing decisions about patient care and safety, productivity, efficiency, service transformation and 
enhancing working lives. (Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-26). All learners and staff need to be able 
to use the knowledge and library services they need, irrespective of their base. (NHS Library and 
Knowledge Services in England Policy) 
 
Investing in NHS knowledge and library services is a good example of investing to improve value. An 
independent health economics study has shown that these services give the ‘Gift of Time’, delivering 
value for money and making a positive return on investment. Taking the ‘heavy lifting’ out of getting 
evidence into practice to improve the quality of care, they deliver a cost benefit ratio of 1:2.4 based on 
savings of clinicians’ time alone. This does not include the wider value of improved access to higher 
quality evidence and the resulting impact on patient outcomes, costs, productivity and the workforce.  
 
 
CONTEXT 
 
The establishment of Integrated Care Boards in July 2022 generates new opportunities for system 
leaders to ensure appropriate provision of knowledge and library services to learners and the 
workforce, and to maximise the value of investment in knowledge resources across systems. HEE’s 
regional knowledge and library services leads are pleased to support these discussions.   
 
Changes to education tariff in September 2022 will see the redistribution of education funding to 
create an increased clinical tariff price. Medical undergraduate tariff is extended to include placements 

in primary care and PIVO settings (private, independent and voluntary organisations). Moreover, 

changes to tariff do enable consideration of indicative arrangements. It is timely, therefore, to revisit 
the basis on which 1) placement provider organisations with a knowledge and library service 
determine the allocation of funding to the service, and 2) on which placement provider organisations 
without their own knowledge and library service reach a service level agreement with another 
organisation. Accordingly, these recommendations are offered as indicative guidance. 
 
 
INDICATIVE FUNDING LEVELS 
 
Placement providers receive a contribution to the cost of knowledge and library services from HEE as 
part of the placement fee.  The NHS Education Contract specifies that the Placement Provider will 
ensure that there is: 
 

• a proactive, high-quality knowledge and library service that is available to all staff and 
learners. (14.2) 

• an appropriate level of funding, both from education tariff and matched employer 
contributions, to support delivery of proactive, high-quality knowledge services. (14.8)

As an indicative figure, it is recommended that a minimum of 2.4% of the placement fee paid by HEE 
is committed to knowledge and library services, to be matched by employer contributions.  This 
applies to organisations with their own knowledge and library service, and to organisations which 
commission provision via a Service Level Agreement.   
 
This percentage was identified through a review of funding provided by HEE for library services from 
tariff. The review was completed by HEE Finance in 2017 in response to an HEE commissioned, 
independent audit. It examined data from all regions over a three-year period. It identified the average 
funding to knowledge and library services from tariff as 2.4%.  
 
Understanding the economic benefits of investing in knowledge and library services, and the value to 
patients and the workforce, many NHS organisations allocate funding well above the indicative 
minimum. This allows them to resource high quality proactive knowledge services with the right team 
and the right resources to maximise the benefits.   
 
HEE’s regional knowledge and library services leads are pleased to work with Trusts on service 
development to help them realise the benefits of the Gift of Time. 
 
 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE PROCUREMENT 
  
Investing in more collaborative procurement is another good example of investing to improve 
value.  The 2022/23 Guidance makes provision for this: “Where a provider hosts particular services, 
such as library services, HEE may agree the basis for any recharges that the host provider wishes to 
make. If all the organisations within a local area agree to a pooled support system, they may agree 
that HEE, or another named organisation manage a proportion of the placement fee on their behalf.” 
(DHSC Education and Tariff Guidance and Prices 2022 - 2023, Section 7.7)  
 
There is a high degree of commonality of spend on digital knowledge resources by local NHS 
knowledge and library services. To achieve better value for money, there is the opportunity for 
placement providers to pool funding into central, regional or coordinated procurement of digital 
knowledge resources. This will significantly strengthen the ability to deliver system-wide savings. It will 
also widen access to resources for NHS learners and staff, and release staff time from procurement 
and resource management.    
  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
The following recommendations are offered as guidance. It is recommended that Placement 
Providers in every setting:  
 

1. facilitate and promote the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research, 
encouraging staff and learners to maximise the value of using the knowledge and library 
service to support learning and decision making. 

2. commit a minimum of 2.4% of the placement fee paid by HEE to the knowledge and library 
service 

3. ensure that, as a minimum, funding allocated to the knowledge and library service from the 
placement fee paid by HEE is matched by an employer contribution  

4. engage with the knowledge and library service manager to ensure that the service has the 
right resources to offer proactive, high-quality knowledge and library services to all learners 
and staff  

5. encourage the knowledge and library service to work with other services, and with the 
national NHS knowledge and library service team, to achieve better value through more 
collaborative procurement
