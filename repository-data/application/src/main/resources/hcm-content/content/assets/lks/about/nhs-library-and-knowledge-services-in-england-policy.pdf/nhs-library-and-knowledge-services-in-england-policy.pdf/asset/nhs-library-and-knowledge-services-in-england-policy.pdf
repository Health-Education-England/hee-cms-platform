NHS Library and Knowledge Services in England 

 

Policy 
 

 
1 INTRODUCTION 

 

The Secretary of State for Health has a duty, under the Health and Social Care Act 
2012, to ensure “the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research’.

Health Education England published Knowledge for Healthcare: a Development 

Framework for NHS Library and Knowledge Services in England in December 2014.

This sets out a clear vision: 
 

NHS bodies, their staff, learners, patients and the public use the right 
knowledge and evidence, at the right time, in the right place, enabling high 

quality decision-making, learning, research and innovation to achieve 
excellent healthcare and health improvement. 

 

The contribution of healthcare library and knowledge services to education, lifelong 
learning, research and evidence-based practice is widely valued, supplying the 
evidence base to the service to make decisions on treatment options, patient care and 
safety, commissioning and policy, as well as to support lifelong learning, undertake research 
and drive innovation.  
 

 Introducing the framework Prof. Ian Cumming, Chief Executive of Health Education 
England also noted: 

 
Our ambition is to extend this role so that healthcare knowledge services 

become business-critical instruments of informed decision-making and 
innovation. 

 

To this end, and in accordance with the principles of the NHS Constitution
3 

(See 
Appendix 1), Health Education England has agreed the following policy:  

 
 
2 POLICY STATEMENT 

 
To ensure the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research, Health 

Education England is committed to: 
 

 Enabling all NHS workforce members to freely access library and knowledge 
services so that they can use the right knowledge and evidence to achieve 

excellent healthcare and health improvement. 



 Developing NHS librarians and knowledge specialists to use their expertise to 
mobilise evidence obtained from research and organisational knowledge to underpin 
decision-making in the National Health Service in England  

 Developing NHS library and knowledge services into a coherent national service that is 
proactive and focussed on the knowledge needs of the NHS and its workforce .  

 

3 RATIONALE 
 
3.1 Purpose 

People should be cared for by competent and capable staff, receptive to innovation 
and able to use evidence from research. All NHS bodies and staff should be able to 

access the expertise and resources offered by healthcare librarians and knowledge 
specialists.  
 
 
3.2 Context 

The NHS is experiencing a period of unrivalled change.  Globally, economies are 
experiencing a shift from the ‘white heat of technology’ of the mid-twentieth-century 
into today’s digital age. This new landscape is one in which information is the 

currency of healthcare.  
 

Healthcare is a knowledge industry. It is not enough to have the right teams in the 
right place, collaborating to deliver high quality, efficient patient care. It is essential 
that they use the right knowledge and evidence at the right time.  The knowledge 

and know-how of staff are precious assets. Health Education England is committed 
to building a flexible workforce, responsive to innovation and new technologies with 

knowledge about best practice, research and innovation, which promotes adoption 
and dissemination of better quality service delivery. Applying and embedding 
knowledge into action is the currency of successful organisations.  

 
The Carter review identified a need to “Improve the decision making process using 

factual data and evidence”.
4   

Librarians can make a critical contribution to improving 
quality outcomes and meeting the productivity and performance challenge by ensuring 
teams are sighted on evidence from research to inform decision-making, targeting 

and tailoring information to manage information overload, organising that body of 
knowledge and keeping colleagues updated. 

 
 
3.3 Capitalising on the specialist skills of librarians and knowledge 

specialists  
 

Evidence does not speak for itself but needs to be mobilised at the right time, 
and through the right people, to make a difference in decision making.

5   

 

Health Education England has identified a priority for NHS library services to 
mobilise the evidence base, bringing it the boardroom and the bedside.  
 

Librarians comprise a small, specialised workforce in the NHS. Their contribution to 

education and research is highly valued. Increasingly, they are called upon to take a 
more active role as knowledge brokers.  Health Education England recognises the 



value of these enhanced roles in which librarians share their expertise with teams in the 
workplace, enabling staff to find, evaluate and use evidence.  
 
 

3.4 Partnership working  

In this Knowledge Age it has never been more essential for the service to promote 

the use of research evidence and for all NHS bodies to ensure their staff can 
capitalise on the specialist expertise of healthcare librarians and knowledge 

specialists.  
 
Health Education England is working with CILIP, the Chartered Institute of Library and 

Information Professionals to realise these aims, and to more strongly profile the positive 
impact of NHS library and knowledge services.
