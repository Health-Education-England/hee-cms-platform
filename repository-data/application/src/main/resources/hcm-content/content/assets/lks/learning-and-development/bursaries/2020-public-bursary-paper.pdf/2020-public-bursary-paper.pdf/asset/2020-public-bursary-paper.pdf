Prepared by Catherine McLaren  Date Completed: January 2020 

 

Appendices: Application Form and Feedback Form. 

 
Context: Value of Bursaries 

Health Education England leads on developing a flexible NHS workforce, open to innovation and 

change. It is through education, and sharing knowledge, research evidence and best practice, that we 

inspire and inform innovation and improvements in patient care and safety, experience and outcome. 

To achieve these ambitions individuals must be supported to broaden as well as deepen their 

knowledge. (Knowledge for Healthcare, 2014, p2) 

Bursaries are one way of meeting this need and should be available to all LKS staff supporting the 

NHS in England. Bringing the different ways of awarding bursaries into an agreed national process is 

needed to support the ideals of One HEE and the core Knowledge for Healthcare principle of equal 

opportunity for the whole of this small, specialised workforce, regardless of postcode. 

Bursaries allow individuals in this small national workforce to develop, access new and innovative 

practices at an early opportunity and share their wider learning across the NHS. It allows them to 

understand that they are not working in isolation. Bursaries allow them to see they are a key 

member of staff, bringing learning and experiences back into their own organisation, for the benefit 

of patients and the public. This learning and experience gained through bursaries can also be shared 

and spread throughout the wider HEE and NHS LKS community.  

 

Principles: 

• The new process will start from April 2020. 

• The paperwork and application process are identical across all HEE regions. 

• Bursaries will cover course/ forum/ conference fees only. 

• Bursaries will primarily cover conferences in England.  

• Nearby international conferences will be considered on a case by case basis. 

• Successful recipients will be expected to report back following the conference. 

• Applications will be judged on the criteria below. 

 

Criteria: 

• The bursary will be of demonstrable benefit: 

o To the individual, 

o The NHS organisation the individual works for, 

o To HEE, 

o To the wider NHS LKS community. 

• The individual will share their learning during the conference. 

• The individual will share their learning after the event with the wider NHS LKS community. 

• The individual will complete a feedback form and return it to HEE. 

 



  
  

 
Process 

• Stage 1: HEE KM Team to horizon scan relevant conferences and events for the year and 

share details with the network. 

• Stage 2a: Strategic leads to annually prioritise some conferences, events and number of 

bursaries to be offered. 

• Stage 2b: Parallel opportunity for LKS staff to apply for funding for workshops and other CPD 

opportunities that they identify.  

• Stage 3a: Bursaries applications to be reviewed by two members of the national CPD group 

and 1 of the strategic leads.  

• Stage 3b: Applications for funding for workshops and other CPD opportunities to be 

reviewed by two members of the national CPD group and 1 of the strategic leads.
