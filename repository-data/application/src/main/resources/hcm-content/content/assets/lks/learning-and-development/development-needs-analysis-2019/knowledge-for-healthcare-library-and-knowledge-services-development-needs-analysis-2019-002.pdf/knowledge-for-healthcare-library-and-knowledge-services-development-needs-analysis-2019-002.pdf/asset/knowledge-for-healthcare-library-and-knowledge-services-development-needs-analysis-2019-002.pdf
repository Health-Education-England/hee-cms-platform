Executive Summary 
 
 

 
Demographically, the responses to the 2019 Development Needs Analysis Survey match those 
of previous surveys and of the wider ‘what is known’ across libraries, so we believe that this is a 
fair and accurate representation of the Health Library and Knowledge Sector workforce. There 
was a drop of 14% in respondents from 2017 to 2019 – in real figures a reduction from 758 to 
656. 
 
Reports have been produced that analyse the data across the Health Education England’s 
regions and across four banding groups – Bands 2-4, 5, 6 and Band 7+. These reports are 
available request by contacting either Michael Cook (Michael.cook@bolton.gov.uk) or Gil Young

2019 2017

The responses received in this survey 
broadly match the 2017 responses and 
the wider demographic data of the 
library and knowledge workforce, with a 
less than 3% variance in any of the top 
responses for the demographic 
questions compared to the 2017 survey. 
The questions were asked to ensure fair 
and accurate representation of the 
workforce. In total there were 656 
responses to the 2019 Development 
Needs Analysis (DNA) survey , which 
was reduced from 758 responses to the 
2017 DNA survey.

About You – Work 
The questions were asked to ensure fair and accurate representation of the workforce. The 
demographic responses received in this survey broadly match the 2017 responses and the 
wider demographic data of the library and knowledge workforce.  
 

 
 
In terms of job roles – the top three responses: Library Assistant (30.6%), Library Services 
Manager (19.2%) & Librarian (17.8%) total over two-thirds of the responses. In 2017 these three 
job roles totalled a similar amount – but with a different breakdown – Library Assistants –
(25.6%), Library Service Managers (19.6%) and Librarians (21.3%) which may highlight a 
change in the role mix within health library services. 

 
Comparing 2019 and 2017 responses, there is a slight increase in the percentage of 
respondents up to Band 5, and then a consistent decrease from Band 6 on including a reduction 
of 4.3% in Band 7 since the 2017 survey.

In 2017, 59.2% of respondents told us that they worked in an ‘Acute Organisation’ including 
Foundation Trust or a Teaching/Specialist/Children’s Hospital. In 2019, this figure was similar 
(58.2%).  
 
When looking at length of time in post, there is a 7% increase (34.03%) in those who have been 
in their current post for between one and five years since the 2017 survey, offset by reductions 
in those who have been in their roles either less than a year (2017 = 14.1%, 2019 = 11.8%) and 
between six and nine years (2017 = 18.46%, 2019 = 15.09%). Respondents with 10 years or 
more in the current post has remained at a similar rate (32-34%) since the 2013 Development 
Needs Analysis survey. 
 
As with the 2017 survey, for the 2019 respondents, Full time workers remained around 60% and 
respondents educated to degree or higher was once again over 80%.

About You – Professional Development 
Are you a member of CILIP HLG (Health Libraries Group)? 
 

 
 
These figures broadly match the 2017 figures. In 2019, 52.4% of total respondents were 
members of CILIP Health Libraries Group. In 2017, 54.3% of total respondents were members.  
 
In the past two years, have you attended any formal leadership training? 
 

 
 
Unsurprisingly, the majority of respondents who have attended leadership courses (133 out of 
656) are from the higher bands – with over two-thirds from Band 6 or higher. Of the 133 
respondents who have attended formal leadership training in the past two years, 5 selected 
leadership as an area they wished to develop.

Have you ever used the PKSB for Health? 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
379 respondents told us that they had never used PKSB for Health. When asked why they had 
never used the PKSB for Health in an open-ended question, over 200 responses were received, 
which produced several themes, focusing on the individual and the resource itself:  
 

• Lack of awareness – The largest cohort of respondents (30% of the responses) told us 

that they had never heard of PKSB for Health or had heard of PKSB for Health but had 

forgotten about it.  

• Lack of opportunity – Many respondents were aware of PKSB for Health, but felt that 

they hadn’t the right opportunity to use it.

• Lack of relevance – Over 30 respondents felt that the PKSB for Health lacked relevance 

to their role – with specific reasons given including ‘it’s for librarians’, ‘nearing retirement’ 

and an unwillingness to use it due to it being a ‘CILIP’ resource. 

• Lack of time – a lot of respondents expressed a lack of time within their role to be able to 

use PKSB for Health. 

• Resource functionality – Over 10% of respondents felt that the resource itself lacked 

functionality – too wordy, too long or dated ‘coming soon since 2016’. 

• Resources accessibility - Over 10% of respondents also had trouble accessing the 

resource – with main reasons being unable to access it via the log-in, or a false belief 

that you needed to be a CILIP member to access. 

• Using a different resource – Some respondents preferred to use a different resource. 

Many of these have or are undergoing professional registration, so have been using the 

general PKSB. Others use internal/trust resources.  

 
 
Travelling to Training Events 
 
Only 2% of respondents said that they were unable to travel to events.  
 

 
 
These figures match the 2017 figures and the overlying trends – the higher your banding the 
increased willingness to travel beyond your region. The comments received on this question 
highlighted individual preferences to training events with the only common themes were that 
distance/location of training may not be the sole deciding factors – cost of attendance and time 
pressures can also impact attendance.

Development Choice Commentary 
 
From the ‘overall top 10’ in the 2017 Development Needs Analysis Survey, eight development 
choices remain in the 2019 survey with the choices dropping out being: 

• Health information for patients and carers – since the 2017 survey, there has been a 

comprehensive national programme of work undertaken by Health Education England 

and partners to development knowledge and understanding on ‘Health information for 

patients and carers’ across the Library and Knowledge sector including health. This 

includes support to deliver health literacy awareness training. 

• Knowledge management – Since the 2017 survey, Health Education England has 

undertaken a comprehensive programme of work to support the knowledge management 

development of Health Library and Knowledge staff to ensure the principles of 

‘Knowledge for Healthcare’ can be delivered effectively.  As noted above, in the 2019 

survey, it was renamed ‘Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration’ which may have also 

impacted its placing. 

Other notes of interest: 

• Emerging Technology, both in ranking and weighted responses, had the biggest growth 

between the 2017 and 2019 surveys.  As can be seen in the table below showing 

preferred learning outcomes, this covers a very wide area including the impact of the 

Topol Review.  

• Only 13% of respondents made 5 or more choices. 63.5% made 2 or more choices, 

40.4% made 3+, 22.1% made 4+ and 9.4% made the full 6 choices. The first choice was 

a mandatory response.  

• When examining the breakdowns of the weighted results for either the banding 

respondent groups or the overall results, the gap between the #1 and #5 choices is often 

less than the gap between choice #5 or choice #20 (or choice #30 or #40 in some 

groups). This shows that the development choices are clearly stated across the banding 

groups. 

• In the Bands 2-4 respondent groups, the top choice ‘Literature Searching/Information 

Retrieval’ received a weighted score of over double the second choice (HDAS). In fact – 

these top two similar choices collectively received a higher score than the remaining 

eight choices within the top 10 Bands 2-4 combined, showing a clear stated need within 

this respondent group. 

• Only the Top 8 choices in the Band 5 grouping were selected by 10% or more than that 

respondent group. The top choice ‘Emerging Technology’ was selected by 20.3% of this 

respondent group (compared to 34.1% of Band 7+ and 16% of Overall where it was also 

#1 choice). 

• ‘Demonstrating Value and Impact’ and ‘Emerging Technologies’ are clear developmental 

areas for the Band 6 respondent group with over a third of respondents selecting it within 

their top 3 development areas.  

• Quality Improvement was the #6 choice in the overall list, and #2 in the Band 7+ 

respondent group, with this group accounting for 52% of overall responses.  

• Many of the development choices which directly aligned to the Quality and Impact 

Outcomes Framework didn’t rank highly in the development choices, aside from in the 

Band 7+ respondent group.

Development Needs Explored 
 
The tables below summarise the top 10 ‘Overall Results’ and the top 5 results from the banding respondent groupings looking at 
responses from question 13 through to question 23. This series of questions focused on development choices, development importance, 
level of need, and preferred learning methods. Where free text answers have been provided to describe respondent’s required learning 
outcomes, these are represented by themes. The ‘Rank’ column shows the order of frequency that each development need was 
selected. All the results have been stratified by banding for each development need.
