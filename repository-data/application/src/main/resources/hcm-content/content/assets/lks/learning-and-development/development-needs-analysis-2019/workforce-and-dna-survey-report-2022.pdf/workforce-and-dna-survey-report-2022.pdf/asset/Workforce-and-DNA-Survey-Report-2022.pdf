Four of the top 10 priorities for all knowledge and library roles, are new entries when 
compared with the priorities for 2019. This highlights the influence of the new HEE strategy 
Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-26. The importance of ‘literacy skills’, where 57% of 
respondents said it was a priority to them, shows this is an area that is new to them and 
therefore requires some significant upskilling.  

For 2021, the learning and development offers were categorised by the 2021 Knowledge for 
Healthcare workstreams and the categories are slightly at odds with those used in the 2019 
survey.  

The mobilising evidence and knowledge workstream incorporates “knowledge sharing and 
collaboration” from the 2019 survey.

Introduction: Survey Purpose 
 

The Health Education England Knowledge and Library Services Continuing Professional 

Development (CPD) Group is tasked with identifying the learning and development needs of 

the specialist NHS knowledge and library workforce. The group is then responsible for 

delivering tailored learning and development opportunities to meet the identif ied needs. 

Between October and November 2021, the 1,113 NHS knowledge and library staff were 

invited to complete a “Profiling and Development Needs Analysis Survey”. This collected 

anonymous data about: 

• the size and make-up of the knowledge and library workforce 

• work details  

• self-directed learning 

• top five individual priorities for learning and development 

• preferred delivery methods for learning and development 

• top two team priorities for learning and development  

• Knowledge for Healthcare bursaries for learning and development 

This report provides an overview of the survey results comparing, where possible and 

appropriate, the results from 2021 with those from the previous survey in 2019.

In 2019 there were 1,162 NHS knowledge and library staff in post compared with 1,113 in 
April 202. In 2021, 357 respondents completed the survey which amounts to 32% of the total 
NHS knowledge and library workforce, compared with 656 in 2019 or 56%.  

The gender split for 2021 is roughly the same (76% versus 75%) female. The age of the 
workforce is also similar percentage-wise for 2019 and 2021.

In 2021, 14% of respondents reported their day-to-day activities were either limited a little of 
a lot because of a health problem or disability this is up slightly from the 2019 figure of 12%. 

There was a slight change to the ethnic make-up of the knowledge and library staff in 2021 
compared with 2019, with an increase from 83% to 87% of respondents stating their e thnicity 
was “White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish, British”.

About Knowledge and Library Service Staff’s Work 
 

The questions about work were asked to ensure that we received responses from 
knowledge and library staff working in all roles, types of organisations with knowledge and 
library services and from each of the seven HEE regions.  

Job role 

 

 

In 2019 a much wider range of job roles were provided for respondents to choose. The roles 
have been categorised to match the six role groups used in the 2021 survey and the chart 
above shows both the 2019 and 2021 data. The most significant difference is the  fact that 
there is a 33% reduction in the number of library assistants and paraprofessional staff 
completing the 2021 survey. 

However, while responses in 2019 for the top three roles amounted to 66% of the 
respondents, in 2021 this had increased to 77% of  the respondents. Proportionally, more 
Knowledge and Library Service Managers responded to the survey than any other role group 
in 2021.

Which of the following best describes your role? 

2019 2021



NHS Pay banding/salary scale 

 

 

While the actual percentage split for the number of staff in the bands/salary scales in 2021 
and 2019 are very similar, the responses reflect the fact that fewer staff in bands 2, 3 and 4 
completed the survey.  

 

Length of time in current post  
 

 

Full time or part time employment  
 

 
 

Compared with 2019, there is a 6% increase in the number of respondents who had been in 
post less than a year (from 11.9% in 2019 to 18%), with a drop of 2% for those in post 1 to 5 
years and a drop of 4% for those respondents in post in 2021 for 10 of more years.  

More respondents worked full-time in 2021 (65% versus 60%) but this may be impacted by 
the lower response rate from library assistants and paraprofessionals.

Future career options 

 
 

 

This question was new to the 2021 survey and was designed to understand what the future 
workforce might look like. The 62 (17%) respondents who said they would be retired within 
the next five years, reflects the fact that 99 or 28% would be of an age to take retirement 
under the NHS Pension scheme. 

It is gratifying that 57% of respondents thought they would still be working in a healthcare 
knowledge and library service, with only 11 or 3% moving to a new sector. 

74 respondents (21%) stated they were not thinking ahead to what they might be doing in 
f ive years’ time. This may be due to general uncertainty in October to November 2021and 
the recent challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.

region. 

Organisation 

 

The spread of organisations at which respondents work, is very similar in make-up to those 
listed in 2019. Given the larger number of acute trusts, it is not surprising that in 2021 66% of 
respondents work at either a regular acute trust or an acute trust integrated with community 
or social care. In 2019 this figure was 69%, with the next highest being mental health at 
13%, which in 2021 is slightly lower at 12%. 

Whereas in 2019, 3 people (0.5%) reported being employed in a commissioning organisation 
by 2021 no-one reported this. Also significant is the reduction in 2021 in the number of 
respondents from a local authority including Public Health and social care from 22 (3%) in 
2019 to 3 (1%) in 2021.

Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals 

(CILIP) 
 

Membership of CILIP 

 

In 2021 63% of respondents were members of CILIP which is the knowledge and library 
services’ professional body. In 2019, this question was not asked but 53% of respondents 
did report that they were a member of the Health Libraries Group which is a CILIP sub-
group. 

 

CILIP Professional Knowledge and Skills Base (PKSB) 

 

The CILIP Professional Knowledge and Skills Base (PKSB), identif ies the knowledge and 
skills required for knowledge and library professionals. There is a sector specific PKSB for 
the healthcare sector. The PKSB was recently updated. In total, nearly 58% of respondents 
had used the PKSB. This question was not asked in the 2019 survey.

Respondents could select as many reasons for using the PKSB as they wanted. The most 
popular use of the PKSB was for “personal development”  (65.5%), with respondents in all 
f ive roles reporting this as the reason they had mostly used the PKSB, followed by career 
development or planning (37.4%) and “appraisal/professional development 
review/performance review” (29.6%). 

12.6% of respondents had used the PKSB to carry out an audit of the knowledge and skills 
of staff working for them to identify gaps and areas where development was required.  

When asked to list other reasons for using the PKSB, 8.3% of respondents stated: 

• As part of a course (MA, PG, leadership) (8) 

• As a mentor to CILIP award candidates (3) 
• Personal audit of skills (3) 

• Team audit of skills (2) 

• To help management understand our role (1)

206 respondents told us that they had never used the PKSB. When asked why, in an open-
ended question, 152 responses were received, which produced several themes, focusing on 
the individual and the resource itself:  

• Lack of awareness –32 (21%) respondents told us that they had never heard of the 
PKSB or had heard of it but had forgotten about it.  
 

• Lack of opportunity – 10 (7%) respondents were aware of the PKSB, but felt that they 
had not the right opportunity to use it.  
 

• Lack of relevance – The largest cohort of respondents (45 or 30%) felt that the PKSB 
lacked relevance to their role – with specific reasons given including ‘not required/no 
need to’ or it’s for qualif ied librarians’.  
 

• Lack of time – a lot of respondents (27 or 18%) said they were too busy or did not 
have time within their role to be able to use the PKSB.  
 

• Resource functionality – 5% (or 8) of respondents felt that the resource itself lacked 
functionality – too long, complicated, confusing.  
 

• Resources accessibility – 14% of respondents also had trouble accessing the 
resource as they were not CILIP members. However, HEE has an agreement with 
CILIP so that non-members working in the NHS healthcare library and knowledge 
services can access the PKSB.  
 

• Using a different resource – Some respondents preferred to use a different resource 
such as internal/trust resources.

Learning and Development Opportunities 
 

Self-directed learning 

 

Respondents were able to select multiple options for this question. 18% 0f respondents used 

a Knowledge for Healthcare provided resource (toolkits on the website or the Learning 

Zone). Publications in a variety of formats were the most listed resource used for self-

directed learning by 26% of the respondents. 

There were 56 “other” responses to this question , ranging from Twitter/social media, 

YouTube and LinkedInLearning through to online webinars or courses, internal courses, 

websites, blogs, library visits and colleagues.

Development Opportunities 

 

Respondents could choose as many options as they wanted. The chart above shows the 
replies from all respondents, with the percentage representing the proportion of all 
respondents. 

 

The development opportunities were further analysed by the role of the respondent. Library 
assistants /paraprofessionals and level 3 apprentices were more interested in shadowing, 
closely followed by peer support, mentoring and communities of practice. 

Professionally qualif ied roles were interested in all the development opportunities listed. 
Communities of practice were most popular with Knowledge and Library Service Managers 
and embedded/clinical/outreach librarians/knowledge specialists; while more librarians/ 
deputy librarians/ assistant librarians opted for peer support.

Preferred delivery style for learning and development opportunities 

 

In 2019, 49% of respondents preferred their learning and development delivered either face 
to face (1-1s or smaller groups) or in a classroom in the form of workshops and study days. 
In 2021, classroom delivery was not listed as an option. The most popular delivery format 
was ‘live online learning opportunities’, at 36% closely followed by a ‘mixture of delivery 
styles.’ 

This question was not asked 
in 2019. Respondents would 
prefer any learning and 
development that requires 
more than half a day’s 
‘attendance’ to be delivered 
as longer sessions, 
minimising the number of 
days attendance required.

In the 2021 survey, team leaders were asked to supply the top two learning and 
development priorities for their team. While there is some synergy with the personal priorities 
listed in the next section below, five priorities appear in both lists (rankings in brackets):  
 
 Team priority 2021 Personal priority 2021 
Collecting and using Impact 1 10 
Marketing 2 6 
Digital Literacy 6 1 
Expert Searcher Skills  7 3 
Health Literacy 9 2 

 
Team leaders felt that three offers from the Mobilising Evidence and Knowledge workstream 
were of more importance: 

• Developing an aligned evidence and knowledge mobilisation action plan using the 
self-assessment tool 

• Evaluation and impact of knowledge mobilisation 

• Tools for knowledge transfer and organisational learning. 
 

Personal learning and development priorities 
 

The key part of the survey was designed to find out from respondents what are their top five 
learning and development requirements over the next two to three years. This information 
will help HEE’s knowledge and library service team develop learning and development offers 
that takes in to account the needs of health care knowledge and library specialists working at 
all levels in England. 

For the 2019 survey, priorities were categorised by pay band rather than the role as this was 
felt to be more appropriate and helpful when designing future learning and development 
activities. 

Where possible, comparisons in priorities between 2019 and 2021 will be made using the 
equivalent pay band and role.

Commentary 

Four of the top 10 priorities for all knowledge and library roles, are new entries when 
compared with the priorities for 2019. This highlights the influence of the new HEE strategy 
Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-26. The importance of ‘literacy skills’, where 57% of 
respondents said it was a priority to them, shows this is an area that is new to them and 
therefore requires some significant upskilling.  

For 2021, the learning and development offers were categorised by the 2021 Knowledge for 
Healthcare workstreams and the categories are slightly at odds with those used in the 2019 
survey.  

The mobilising evidence and knowledge workstream incorporates “knowledge sharing and 
collaboration” from the 2019 survey.

Commentary 

For the 2019 survey, priorities were categorised by pay band rather than the role. 
Comparisons in priorities between 2019 and 2021 will be made using the equivalent role and 
pay band. This table shows the approximate equivalences for role and pay band. 

The 2019 Development Needs Analysis Report stated that ‘health information for patients 
and carers’ and ‘knowledge management’ had both dropped out of the overall top 10 when 
compared with the Development Needs Analysis survey results from 2017. This was 
because there had been two significant development programmes to upskill knowledge and 
library staff with these skills. In 2021, similar development opportunities are back in the top 
10 priorities which aligns with the strategic outcomes of Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-26. 

• ‘Digital literacy’ and ‘health literacy’ are listed as priorities for four of the five roles, 
with only Embedded / Clinical / Outreach Librarian / Knowledge Specialists not 
including ‘health literacy’ in their top 10 priorities. 
 

• Four elements of the Mobilising Evidence and Knowledge workstream appear as 
priorities for three of the five roles: Knowledge and Library Service Managers, 
Embedded / Clinical / Outreach Librarian / Knowledge Specialists and Others. 
 

Offers from the Resource Discovery workstream ‘Synthesis and Summaries for Evidence 
Reviews’, ‘Finding evidence and knowledge to inform non-clinical decision making’, ‘Expert 
Searcher Skills’, ‘Open Access Publishing’ all appear in the top 10 priorities for Librarian/ 
Deputy Librarian/ Assistant Librarian and Embedded / Clinical / Outreach Librarian / 
Knowledge Specialists who often have similar roles in supporting users in accessing the 
evidence base. In the 2019 report some equivalents namely: ‘Synthesis and summarising’, 
‘Literature searching/Information retrieval’ also featured in the top 10 for Bands 2-4, 5 and 6. 

Skills relating to research are new entries in the 2021 top 10, with four of the five roles 
prioritising ‘Research skills’, ‘Evidence Based Librarianship’, ‘Collaborating with researchers 
on joint projects’, ‘Skills for supporting researchers’ and ‘Open Access Publishing’.  
Knowledge and Library Service Managers do not include research skills in their top 10 
priorities. 

Quality and impact features as a priority in three of the five roles but Library Assistant / 
Paraprofessional/ Level 3 apprentices and Others do not list any quality and impact 
priorities. 

Library Assistant / Paraprofessional/ Level 3 apprentices list f ive priorities from the 
Workforce Planning and Development workstream which includes a lot of the softer skills 
such as ‘Customer service skills’, ‘Marketing’ and ‘Training skills’. 

Knowledge and Library Service Managers, as expected, include several priorities that relate 
to developing and managing the service: ‘Strategic planning’, ‘Leadership’, ‘Stakeholder 
engagement’ ‘Key Performance Indicators’. Only ‘Leadership’ does not appear in their 2019 
priorities.
