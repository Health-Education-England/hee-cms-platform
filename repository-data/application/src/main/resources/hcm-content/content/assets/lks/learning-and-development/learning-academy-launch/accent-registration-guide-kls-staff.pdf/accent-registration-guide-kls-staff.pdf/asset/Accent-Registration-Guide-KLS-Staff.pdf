What is Accent? 

Accent is a course management and booking system.  It has been used by Health Education England 

for many years to coordinate bookings onto a range of HEE events. 

The HEE KLS team has arranged to use the system to manage course bookings onto knowledge and 

library staff training and development offers provided through the Knowledge for Healthcare Learning 

Academy.  Accent will replace a web-based bookings system used in the north of England, and a 

process used in London and the South.  

 

Why would I register to use it? 

During 2022 the HEE Knowledge and Library Services Team will be transitioning to use Accent for all 

course booking relating to our learning and development offers. 

All knowledge and library staff will need to register for an account on Accent to book onto these 

events.  We would recommend that all team members register individually as managers will not be 

able to book their staff onto events through this system. 

In addition to booking onto events, the system will record the training you have undertaken which may 

be useful for the appraisal / professional development review / professional registration and 

revalidation process.  You will also be able to access certificates of attendance for the events you 

have attended.
