Foreword  

In recent years, talent management has become a priority for organisations worldwide due to a 

shortage in skilled staff, particularly managers. Talent management strategies facilitate the 

development of both individuals and organisations by identifying employees with talent and 

ensuring that they receive the support they require.  

With this in mind, the talent management project team has worked hard to develop a toolkit based 

on employer feedback that will facilitate the design and implementation of a suitable strategy that 

will provide your organisation with greater competitive advantage. 

We hope you find this toolkit useful and informative. As we strive to be as accurate as possible and 

to cover the areas of most concern to employers, please feedback to us any comments you may 

have. Armed with this information we can work with employers and partners to help them develop 

strategies to meet their requirements and develop world class skills.

Glossary 

Aptitude 
 

Aptitude refers to a person’s natural ability to do something. Recruiting 
talented individuals with high aptitude in the right areas is key for 
businesses looking to gain a competitive advantage over their 
competitors. 
 

Aptitude Test Explore an individual’s ability to perform or carry out different tasks. 
These tests tend to have a formal, structured approach where candidates’ 
answer multiple choice questions under exam conditions so that it can be 
administered and scored to ensure results can be compared. 
 

Attitude 
 

An individual’s attitude will often be linked with their outlook and 
personality. Key indicators of an individual’s attitude are the way that 
they communicate with people and their body language or posture. 
 

Attitude Test Examine individual’s preferences for different types of work, as well as 
their opinions, attitudes and behaviour towards others. These 
characteristics are usually assessed using a questionnaire without a time 
limit. The results are then interpreted by an assessor trained to ensure 
interpretation and feedback is accurate. 
 

Benchmarking Benchmarking is used to measure performance using specific indicators – 
for example quality, time, or cost. It is the process of comparing the 
organisation to industry bests or top practices that the firm will be 
aspiring too achieve. Although often seen as a one off event 
benchmarking is a continuous process as organisations should always 
aspire to improve. 
 

Business Case A business case justifies the use of human and financial resources for 
undertaking a particular project, task or strategy within an organisation. It 
will often be presented in the form of a well-structured document or 
formal presentation. 
 

Business Culture 
 

The shared attitudes, values and goals within an organisation.  An 
organisations business culture will determine how staff communicates 
with one another as well as how they deal with clients and customers. 
 

Business Strategy An organisations strategy shows what the organisation wants to achieve 
and how it will achieve it. It includes the purpose of the organisation, 
goals and objectives followed by plans and methods of achieving these 
objectives. 
 

Candidate Relationship 
Management 

This is the process of retaining information about strong candidates ready 
for when other vacancies open up. Sometimes you may have many good 
applications for a role but feel that some candidates would suit other 
roles better. By keeping in touch with them you are giving yourself the 
chance in the future to recruit quickly, efficiently and cost effectively. 
 

  



 

7 
 

Career A person’s career is the sequence and variety of occupations they have 
undertaken throughout their life-time. In the workplace for a role to be 
seen as a career there tends to be some form of job progression along 
with special training of formal education. 
 

Career Adaptability Adaptability is a prerequisite for successful navigation through career 
transitions. Career adaptability can be broken down into the 4C’s, 
Concern, you care about preparing for the future, Control, take 
responsibility for building your own career, Curiosity, taking the initiative 
in exploring new pathways and Confidence, it takes confidence to adapt 
and solve complex problems. 
 

Career Aspirations These are a person’s aims or goals in their career. You can tell how driven, 
lazy, realistic or unrealistic people are by the aspirations that they hold. 
 

Career Planning 
 

The process of career planning is generally regarded as a four step 
process. Self, gather information about yourself. Options, explore and 
research the options you are interested in. Match, identify and evaluate 
the possible occupations. Action, develop the steps to achieve the target 
you have set yourself. 
 

Career Progression Refers to the upward movement or advancement of people in an 
organisation. Typically, only the highest performing talented individuals 
can progress to the very top as most people’s talent levels restrict how far 
they can progress. 
 

Coach 
 

Simply defined, coaching is the process of one person guiding another 
through a process. Often, a more senior member of staff will be assigned 
to a younger less experienced employee in order to assist in their 
personal development. 
 

Coaching A teaching or development process in which an individual receives 
support whilst learning and working towards achieving a goal. Coaching 
can take place in-house or externally. If ran internally it is an opportunity 
for both parties involved to develop their skills. 
 

Corporate Values Corporate values are the operating principles that guide an organisation’s 
internal behaviours, as well as the relationship that the organisation has 
with its customers, staff and stakeholders. 
 

Critical Skill A critical skill is one that is essential in order for an individual to complete 
a task. Although enough to complete a task critical skills alone are not 
enough to reach maximum proficiency at tasks. 
 

Culture of Learning By investing in and developing your workforce you will begin to create a 
culture of learning amongst employees. Those who want to better 
themselves and develop will be willing to learn, which in turn influences 
others until the organisation has an evident learning culture. 
 

  



 

8 
 

Diagnostics 
 

Performing diagnostics is the process of identifying errors and flaws in 
current practices of a business. By performing diagnostics you can help 
align your businesses practices with its objectives and values.  
 

Discrimination The act of discrimination itself means to treat certain groups of people 
less favourably, for example due to gender or sexual orientation. 
Discrimination in the workplace can occur through, staff recruitment, 
terms and conditions, who receives training or not and who is selected to 
progress or be dismissed.  
 

Diversity Diversity literally means difference and is about recognising and valuing 
those differences. By understanding and embracing our individual 
differences we can create a productive environment in which everyone 
feels valued.  
 

Drivers of change Strategic drivers are major forces or trends that will shape the future 
environment for skills within a particular business or industry. For 
example, your organisation may be planning on launching a new product 
or service that will require frontline staff with better communication and 
customer service skills. Alternatively, you may need managers with 
change management skills to facilitate the implementation of supporting 
policies or procedures. 
 

Employability Employability consists of a set of achievements, skills, understandings and 
personal attributes that individuals possess.  
 

Employer Engagement There is no set definition for employer engagement. However, it does 
encompass work-related learning. Most importantly is helps build and 
sustain successful partnerships with employers. 
 

Equality Act 2010 The aim of the Equality Act 2010 was to arrange all of the different 
components of anti-discrimination law in Great Britain under a single act. 
The main acts and regulations it covers are; the Equal Pay Act 1970, Sex 
Discrimination Act 1975, Race Relations Act 1976 and the Disability 
Discrimination Act 1975.   
 

Executive Talent Pool Creating an executive talent pool is the process of sourcing eligible 
candidates for executive roles. Developing talent pools used to be left 
solely to the recruitment industry, however many organisations are now 
wisening up to the fact that they can create their own talent pools, for 
example by using social media sites such as LinkedIn. 
 

Exit Interview An exit interview is conducted with an employee who is leaving an 
organisation. The purpose of such an interview is to glean feedback from 
the departing employee in order to improve aspects of the organisation, 
for example, employee retention. 
 

  



 

9 
 

Experience 
 

Experience is often directly related o the amount of time someone has 
spent working and can come as either specific or transferable experience. 
For young people looking to gain employment experience is often a key 
factor, yet many do not have it. Work experience and placements are 
therefore highly recommended. 
 

Future Skills Needs Using labour market information to predict future skills needs can help to 
improve decision making in areas such as investing in training and 
identifying courses that will best support employee skills needs. However, 
it is important that employers do not solely rely on forecasting methods 
because skill needs are driven by a variety of factors including legislation, 
environment and technological advances.  
 

Hidden Skills Hidden skills are often not job specific skills, but transferable skills that 
you have gained throughout your life. Hidden skills say a lot about a 
person, and although they are often not job specific they can say a lot 
about how a person will fit into an organisation. 
 

Hidden Talent 
 

Are talents and skills that individuals often do not realise that they have. 
They are general life skills that you pick up throughout your journey, such 
as people skills and empathy. Hidden talents also include natural 
aptitudes for tasks that you did not realise you had. Youth unemployment 
is arguably so high at the moment because far too many have not 
exposed their hidden talents. 
 

Higher Level Skills Higher Level Skills are generally viewed as being at National Qualification 
Framework (NQF) Level 4 or above and are often associated with gaining 
higher education qualifications. 
 

High Performance 
Working 

This relates to the way that people are managed whilst at work. It has 
recently emerged that placing people and their skills at the centre will 
secure greater employee involvement and commitment to the 
organisation, leading to high performance working. 
 

In-house The term in-house refers to conducting an activity or operation within an 
organisation, instead of relying on outsourcing. For example, in relation to 
talent management this means that assessments and training will be 
carried out by employees rather than external specialists. 
 

Key Performance 
Indicator (KPI) 

Key Performance Indicators are ways to periodically assess the 
performance of organisations, teams and individuals. The indicators that 
organisations are looking for will depend on the business goals and values 
that they maintain. 
 

Key Roles Key roles are those that cannot be filled by anyone. Senior managerial 
positions, directors and executives, tend to be classed as key roles as you 
need to be very experienced to fill them and to lead the organisation in 
the right direction. 
 

  



 

10 
 

Knowledge 
 

Information and skills acquired through education or experience. 
Experienced employees play a crucial role in passing their knowledge 
down to younger recruits and helping to build in a succession plan. 
 

Knowledge Assessment This is one of the first steps organisations should take when trying to gage 
employee knowledge and competency. It will normally take the form of a 
questionnaire or multiple choice tests. 
 

Leadership The act of leadership can be defined as organising a group of people to 
achieve a common goal. Common traits that have been associated with 
strong leadership skills are; situational interaction, vision, values, 
behaviour, intelligence and charisma, along with others. 
 

Long-term This phrase tends to be measured in years. 5 to 10 years are commonly 
seen as long term time scales. Thinking this far ahead is essential for a 
business to be successful years down the line. 
 

Measureable Any goals and aims that are set for you to achieve in the workplace must 
be measurable. There is no benefit of setting a goal that cannot be 
tracked. By setting measurable goals workplace productivity and 
motivation can be raised. The opposite will occur if there is no realistic 
target in place. 
 

Mental Toughness 
(resilience) 

Mental Toughness describes the capacity of an individual to deal 
effectively with stressors, pressures and challenges, and perform to the 
best of their ability, irrespective of the circumstances in which they find 
themselves (Clough, 2002). 
 

Mentor 
 

A mentor will always involve a more experienced employee taking a new 
recruit ‘under their wing’ It is seen as a developmental practice and is the 
process of transferring knowledge and skills to the younger person in 
order to help their personal development and meet organisation 
objectives. 
 

Mentoring Mentoring is regularly completed as an In-house operation. More senior 
or experienced staff will mentor younger, less experienced staff. The aim 
of mentoring is to support and encourage people in their development to 
reach their maximum potential. 
 

Multiple Ladder Talent 
Management Strategy 

This approach to talent management involves having several talent 
pipelines for different groups of staff in the organisation, such as 
graduates, senior management and general staff, which aims to nurture a 
wide range of skills, not just leadership and management. 
 

Networking An activity that business people take part in, in order to generate new 
business contacts and links. It is seen as a more productive and cost 
effective alternative to advertising as it allows individuals to develop solid 
business relationships. 
 

  



 

11 
 

Non-critical Skill These skills are not essential to complete task, but are desirable as they 
allow for tasks to be completed more quickly and efficiently, or at a lower 
cost than would otherwise be the case. 
 

Online Survey These surveys are commonly used to gather data due to the quick and 
easy nature of them. Attention should be paid to the fact that they should 
not be used alone as the data may be skewed by personal opinions. 
 

Performance Appraisal This is a method in which the job performance of an employee is 
evaluated. Performance appraisals are a part of career development and 
consist of regular reviews of employee performance within organisations. 
 

Performance 
Management 

Includes activities which ensure that goals are consistently being met in 
an effective and efficient manner. Performance management can focus at 
organisational level as well as department, team and individuals. 
 

Personality Assessment Focus on an individual’s style or manner of doing things, as well as how 
they interact with their environment and other people. These 
assessments come in a variety of different formats and provide a 
personality profile rather than a score (because there are no right or 
wrong answers). 
 

Positive Behaviours These are ways of acting that will have a positive influence on you, your 
colleagues and the workforce. Being optimistic, having new ideas and 
supporting your co-workers are all positive behaviours. As well as 
influencing the workplace for the better positive work behaviours will also 
not go unnoticed by those senior to yourself and increase your chances of 
career progression. 
 

Prioritising Prioritising involves determining the order for dealing with a series of 
tasks according to their relative importance. This process can involve 
asking members of the business with extensive knowledge of the 
organisation and who can be trusted to make good decisions to prioritise 
areas for improvement, providing a list that the talent management 
strategy can target. 
 

Professional 
Development  
Plan (PDP) 

A PDP helps you to set out how you would like to develop. For example, it 
can look at where you would like to be in 5 years time and what you need 
to do in order to get there. 
 

Psychometric Test According to the British Psychological Society, a psychometric test is “any 
procedure on the basis of which inferences are made concerning a 
person’s capacity, propensity or liability to act, react, experience or to 
structure or order thought or behaviour in particular ways.” Psychometric 
tests therefore provide in-depth information about the mind-set of 
individuals with the potential talent, identifying their strengths and 
weaknesses so these can be improved to ensure they reach their full 
potential in the future (Van Der Merwe, 2002).  
 

  



 

12 
 

Recruitment 
 

Is the process of attracting and selecting people that best suit a job role. 
Recruitment will take place when people leave an organisation, when a 
firm is expanding and when current employee skill sets no longer meet 
company objectives and training is not an option. 
 

Replacement Planning 
 

Is the process of identifying potential candidates to fulfil a role when core 
employees are known to be leaving the firm at some point in the future. It 
helps to lessen the impact of the departure on the firm particularly if the 
gap would pose a significant risk to the operation of the firm. 
 

Retention 
 

This term refers to an organisations ability to keep hold of employees. The 
most talented desirable employees will always be in demand and it is 
therefore the organisations task to retain these crucial employees, 
financial incentives, ability to progress up the career ladder etc. Certain 
industries, such as cleaning, have high turnover rates due to the nature of 
the work. 
 

Scenario Planning Scenario planning exercises involve identifying future trends and 
exploring the implications by projecting them forward. These projections 
are not forecasts, but possible futures that allow employers to identify 
specific skills that their company will require in the future. 
 

Secondment 
Opportunity 

This provides employees with the opportunity to tryout different roles 
within an organisation. It is a good strategy for the most forward thinking 
organisations as it allows for employees to develop and tests their 
suitability/skills in a different role. 
 

Single Ladder Talent 
Management Strategy 

This approach to talent management involves having one talent pipeline 
focussing on the development of potential leaders or recognised 
professionals. It typically involves qualification attainment, professional 
body membership and requires specific years of experience. 
 

Shadowing Shadowing involves following an industry professional to gain an insight 
into the role by observing their everyday tasks and duties. It is helpful for 
helping people to explore career options. 
 

Short-term This refers to the immediate impacts and goals. For example, if someone 
has completed a course, thy immediately have a higher level of 
knowledge and may have higher morale. 
 

Skills 
 

Proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquired or developed through 
training or experience. Your skills will constantly be developing and 
changing throughout your life and along the way you will develop many 
‘hidden skills.’ 
 

Skills Gap Defined as an instance in which an individual lacks a skill in a particular 
area, preventing them from performing their job effectively (UKCES, 
2012). A skills gap will never have a positive impact on an organisation as 
it will reduce productivity and proficiency. 
 

  



 

13 
 

Skills Gap Analysis The process that an organisation go through in order to identify skills gaps 
within the workforce. Completing a skills gap analysis can significantly 
boost workforce efficiency and productivity once the gaps have been 
addressed. 
 

SMART 
 

A mnemonic to guide people when they set objectives. The letters 
commonly stand for; Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and 
Timely. Recent additions to the acronym include Evaluate and Revaluate. 
 

Succession Planning Is the process of identifying talented individuals within your workforce 
that could step up to fill key business roles in the future when positions 
become available, for example due to retirement. Much of Asset Skills 
remit suffers from an ageing workforce so this is a key process. 
 

SWOT Analysis A planning method that is used to evaluate individuals Strengths, 
Weaknesses, and what they believe to be their Opportunities and Threats. 
It is one of the important first steps that will lead to a successful 
development plan. 
 

Talent Talent is described as the personal qualities “of those individuals who can 
make a difference to organisational performance either through their 
immediate contribution or, in the longer-term, by demonstrating the 
highest levels of potential” (CIPD, 2012) 
 

Talent Diagnostics Tool Talent diagnostic tools are assessments designed to identify talented 

individuals and develop them to support business growth objectives. They 

include the following types of activity: 360 degree feedback, knowledge 

assessments, psychometric testing, performance appraisals and 

professional development plans. 

 
Talent Management Refers to the process of retaining and developing new or current workers 

that your organisation has deemed to be particularly talented. Developing 
talented employees helps an organisation meet its objectives as long as 
this development is aligned with their business objectives. 
 

Talent Management 
Strategy 

A talent management strategy is an organisations approach to developing 
and nurturing their talent. Having a successful strategy in place has been 
proven to boost organisations profitability. 
 

Talent Pool 
 

A talent pool is a selection of employees that have been selected for 
development in a particular area. For example, selecting those that you 
believe can become the directors and leaders of the future. 
 

Targeted Training Targeted training has significant benefits over generic training. It is 
focused on peoples identified training needs. It benefits the individuals by 
receiving focused training as well as the organisation as targeted training 
is a better allocation of resources, more likely to boost productivity and 
will cost less over time. 
 

  



 

14 
 

Training Training is an educational process. People may take n training to learn 
new information, re-learn and reinforce existing knowledge and skills. 
Effective trainings will convey relevant and useful information that allow 
participants to develop their skills and behaviours and improve there 
effectiveness in the workplace. 
 

Training Alignment Using different talent management strategies, such as skills gap and 
training needs analysis will help to match training to the needs of 
individuals. 
 

Training Matrix A table with employees on one axis and training on the other. It helps 
identify training gaps and match employees and candidates to job roles. 
 

Training Needs Analysis Training needs can be defined as: a shortage of skills or abilities, which 

could be reduced or eliminated by means of training and development 

(University of London, 2006). A training needs analysis is therefore the 

process of identifying the skills deficiency and associated training need. 

 
Training Plan 
 

A training plan consists of all the development schemes and training that 
an individual will attend/take part in, with the aim of aligning their skill 
sets and attributes with the company goals and objectives.  
 

Valuing Practices Organisations that facilitate the development of a ‘culture of learning’ can 
support training and development further by implementing valuing 
practices and being willing to invest in the success of their staff. For 
example, line managers can hold annual reviews that not only benchmark 
progress towards goals and targets, but which take account of wider 
career aspirations and then try to align company objectives with 
individual ambitions. 
 

Workforce 
Development 
 

A long-term commitment from a company to continually train its 
employees to meet its strategic goals. Examples of workforce 
development include, training planning, mentoring and coaching. 
 

Workforce Planning Workforce planning is required to ensure that an organisation has suitable 
access to talent to ensure future business success. Failure to prepare a 
workforce plan will put you on the back foot with regards to recruitment 
in comparison better prepared organisations. 
 

360 Degree Assessment A performance appraisal system that gathers feedback on an individual 
from a number of sources, such as supervisors, peers, direct reports, 
external customers and a self-assessment, and can be used to identify 
skills gaps/training needs.
