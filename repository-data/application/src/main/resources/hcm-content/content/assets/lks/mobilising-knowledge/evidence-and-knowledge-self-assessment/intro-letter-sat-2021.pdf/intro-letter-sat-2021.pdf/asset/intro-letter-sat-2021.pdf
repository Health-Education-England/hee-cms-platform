Knowledge Mobilisation Self-Assessment Tool 
 
Healthcare is a knowledge-based industry. Sharing the 'know-how' of staff, using research evidence 
and implementing best practice and innovation are all business critical. How well do NHS organisations 
draw on the knowledge of staff and draw on evidence in decision-making?  
 
As the steward of investment in healthcare library and knowledge services on behalf of the NHS HEE 
published Knowledge for Healthcare: Mobilising evidence; sharing knowledge; improving outcomes. 
Our policy is to work with organisations to ensure that all members of the NHS workforce are able to 
use the right knowledge and evidence at the right time.  
 
Our library and knowledge services leads have developed this simple framework to help you quickly 
assess opportunities to make better use of knowledge as an asset. Completing the tool will enable you 
to: 

➢ assess what is working well and what more could be done 

➢ consider initiatives which will make a positive impact on your bottom line  
➢ prioritise and develop an action plan to help you meet your objectives. 

 
The self-assessment framework comprises: 

1. Introductory information including a Board checklist 

2. An online self-assessment 

3. A discussion of the outcomes and development opportunities 

4. Implementation of an action plan 

This tool can be used in a number of settings including at an executive team meeting or a Board 
seminar. A more comprehensive review can be achieved by each Directorate or Division completing 
individual assessments, which can then be compared to help your organisation adopt best practice 
through targeted support. 
 
Knowledge is a valuable asset that needs to be managed so that the NHS is able to apply knowledge, 
build know-how, continue to learn and drive innovation. I encourage you to make every use of this tool. 
 
Yours faithfully
