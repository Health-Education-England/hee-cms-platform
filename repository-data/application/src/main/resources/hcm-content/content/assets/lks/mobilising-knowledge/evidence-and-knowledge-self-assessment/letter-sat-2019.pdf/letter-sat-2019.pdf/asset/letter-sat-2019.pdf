Dear Colleague, 

 

Utilising external evidence and organisational knowledge  
 

Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the 'know-how' of staff, using research evidence and 
implementing best practice and innovation are all business critical. How well do NHS organisations draw on the 
knowledge of staff and draw on evidence in decision-making?  
 
As the steward of investment in healthcare library and knowledge services on behalf of the NHS HEE published 
Knowledge for Healthcare in December 2014. Our policy is to work with organisations to ensure that all members 
of the NHS workforce are able to use the right knowledge and evidence at the right time.  
 
Our library and knowledge services strategic leads have developed this simple framework to help you quickly 
assess opportunities to make better use of knowledge as an asset. Completing the tool will enable you to: 

 assess what is working well and what more could be done 

 consider which initiatives will make a positive impact on your bottom line  
 prioritise these and draw up an action plan to help you meet your objectives. 

 
The self-assessment framework comprises: 

1. Introductory information including a board checklist 

2. An online self-assessment 

3. A discussion of the outcomes 

4. An action plan 

This tool can be used in a number of settings including at an executive team meeting or a Board seminar. A more 
comprehensive review can be achieved by each Directorate or Division completing individual assessments, 
which can then be compared to help your organisation adopt best practice through targeted support. 
 
Knowledge is a valuable asset that needs to be managed so that the NHS is able to apply knowledge, build know-
how, continue to learn and drive innovation. I encourage you to make every use of this tool. 
 

Yours faithfully  
 

 

 

 

Patrick Mitchell 

Director of Innovation and Transformation
