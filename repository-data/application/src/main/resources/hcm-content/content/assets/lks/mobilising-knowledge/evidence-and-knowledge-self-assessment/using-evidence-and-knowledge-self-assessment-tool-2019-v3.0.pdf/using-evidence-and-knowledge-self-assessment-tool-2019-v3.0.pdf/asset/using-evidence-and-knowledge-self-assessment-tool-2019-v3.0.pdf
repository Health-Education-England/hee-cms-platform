Utilising External Evidence and Organisational Knowledge – A Self-Assessment 

Section 1: Leadership 

 

Leadership 1. Nothing in Place Yet 2. In Early Stages 3. Pockets of Good Practice 4. Business as Usual 

1.1. Leaders and 
their teams use of 
externally  
generated evidence 

No demonstrable use of 
external research 
evidence and best 
practice. 

Makes best use of the 
knowledge they already have. 

Relevant research evidence is 
accessed and used. 

Decisions are underpinned 
by robust evidence which 
has been evaluated. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

1.2. Leaders taking a 
strategic view of using 
external evidence and 
organisational knowledge  

There is no strategic 
commitment to using 
external evidence or 
organisational knowledge. 

There is some strategic 
commitment to optimising 
the use of evidence and 
organisational knowledge. 

The expectation to apply 
evidence and knowledge is 
explicit and embedded within 
strategic documents. 

There is a nominated 
strategic lead, committed 
resource and established 
effective processes. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

1.3. Leadership to support 
the use of external 
evidence and 
organisational knowledge 

There is no visible 
leadership or support. 

Some leaders ensure staff are 
encouraged and supported. 

Some leaders set an example in 
accessing evidence, sharing and 
learning from each other. 

There is strong leadership 
from the top at Board level; 
all leaders act as role 
models. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

1.4. Leaders building a 
learning organisation 
 

Executives are sceptical 
about the benefits of 
utilising external evidence 
and sharing lessons 
learned. 

Most colleagues recognise 
that learning from external 
evidence and sharing internal 
knowledge is important. 

There are examples of projects 
to improve the capture and use 
of knowledge. 

Common processes are in 
place. People are routinely 
using tools to share their 
learning. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

1.5. Leaders advocate and 
model the benefits of using 
evidence and sharing 
knowledge 
 

People are sceptical as to 
the benefits of knowledge 
sharing and reluctant to 
commit time. 

Anecdotal stories 
demonstrate that sharing 
knowledge adds value. 

Some readily acknowledge 
ways in which access to the 
evidence base and sharing 
knowledge add value. 

Formal processes to gather 
and opportunities to 
showcase the impact of 
knowledge sharing are in 
place.

Section 2: Behaviours 
 
 

Behaviours 1. Nothing in Place Yet 2. In Early Stages 3. Pockets of Good Practice 4. Business as Usual 

2.1. Capacity to use  
evidence from research 

Individuals do not invest 
their time in utilising 
research evidence. 

Some individuals and teams 
invest time in finding, 
evaluating and using research 
evidence and best practice. 

In the majority of cases 
responsibility to find, evaluate 
and use research evidence is 
an explicit component of 
appropriate roles. 

The organisation commits 
resource, factoring time and 
cost of document delivery into 
projects so that staff can fulfil 
their responsibility to use 
evidence to inform decisions. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.2. Productivity and 
efficiency 
 

Teams do not use external 
evidence or organisational 
knowledge to improve 
productivity and efficiency. 

Individuals and some teams 
draw on evidence and prior 
learning to improve 
productivity and efficiency. 

Some teams and decision 
making groups have 
established effective 
approaches to source best 
evidence. 

Information and guidance is 
routinely made available to 
improve quality, productivity 
and realise efficiency savings. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.3. Approach to innovation 
 

There is no process in place 
to scan and consider 
innovation. 

Teams consider innovations 
they are aware of. 

Some teams seek, assess and 
adopt innovations. 

There is an established process 
to identify, review and adopt 
innovations. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.4. Approach to keeping up 
to date 

 

Staff are focused on the 
internal agenda. 

Staff make best use of news 
and updating services with 
which they are familiar. 

Staff are proactive in 
requesting alerts on priority 
areas. 

Proactive targeted alerts are 
routinely distributed to, and 
used, by the right people at 
the right time. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.5. Capacity to use 
organisational knowledge  
 

Teams and individuals do 
not invest their time in 
reflecting on t h e  
l e a r n i n g  f r o m  past 
experiences. 

Some individuals and teams 
invest time and resource in 
identifying, sharing and 
making use of knowledge. 

The organisation leads 
corporate initiatives to avoid 
re-inventing the wheel and 
avoid duplication of 
knowledge between 
departments. 

The organisation is committed 
to optimising its knowledge 
assets and commits resource, 
so that staff can use 
knowledge effectively.

2.6. Cross-team working 
and networking 
 

People work on individual 
objectives alone. 

Individuals benefit from 
networking and discussion 
fora. 

Communities of practice 
are organised around 
areas of common 
interest. 

Communities of practice, 
supported by tailored web 
resources are established to 
help deliver priorities. 
Networks connect with each 
other. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.7. Technology for 
collaboration 
 

There is no technological 
solution in place to 
support collaborative 
working. 

Some teams are using 
technology to better 
coordinate their work. 

The organisation is beginning 
to put systems in place across 
the board to use technology 
for collaboration. 

The organisation makes best 
use of technology to allow 
teams to share knowledge 
and work collaboratively. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.8. Access to national 
guidance and policies  
 
 

Guidance and policies from 
NICE, Royal Colleges and 
other national sources are 
neither regularly accessed 
nor reviewed. 

Some guidance and 
policies are 
disseminated. 

Relevant guidance and 
policies are routinely 
reviewed for relevance to 
local practice. 

Relevant guidance and 
policies are routinely 
reviewed, implemented and 
applied in practice. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

2.9. Access to Standard 
Operating Procedures,  
Policies and Guidance 
 

Held within local 
departments and not easily 
accessible.   

Stored and accessible via 
local intranet but limited 
indexing. 

Stored, retrievable and 
shared from a document 
management system 
(such as Sharepoint) but 
no process in place for 
systematic updating. 

Stored, retrievable, shared 
and systematically alerted to 
updates based upon new 
evidence as it becomes 
available.

Section 3: Capabilities and Working Practices 
 
 
 
 
 

3.4. Skills to access evidence 
from research  
 

There is no-one in the 
organisation experienced 
in literature searching. 

Some people can carry out 
basic searches to find 
evidence.  

Requests for evidence are 
sent to librarians with 
advanced skills in literature 
searching, synthesising and 
summarising research. 

Librarians routinely and 
proactively find evidence, 
synthesise and summarise 
results to help inform 
decisions.

Capabilities & 
Working Practices 

1. Nothing in Place Yet 2. In Early Stages 3. Pockets of Good Practice 4. Business as Usual 

3.1. Using organisational 
knowledge, developing skills 
of healthcare workforce 
 

Staff lack skills and 
resources to use 
organisational knowledge 
and the know-how of 
colleagues. 

Some teams actively promote 
resources and training to 
equip staff to build the skills 
they need. 

Staff are generally confident 
to identify and use shared 
resources (e.g. directories 
and protocols). Some teams 
actively articulate and share 
lessons. 

The majority of teams routinely 
develop, share and use 
knowledge to meet business 
priorities, tapping into the body 
of organisational knowledge 
including the know-how of 
colleagues. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

3.2. Skills to mobilise 
knowledge throughout the 
organisation 
 

Staff are unfamiliar with 
practical approaches to 
knowledge management 
in healthcare and 
knowledge sits in silos. 

Staff are supported to gain the 
confidence and skills they need 
to enable the organisation to 
retain and organise internal 
knowledge and to help 
colleagues share know- how. 

Staff have the confidence to 
introduce new initiatives to 
better manage organisational 
knowledge. 

Staff work with librarians and 
knowledge specialists to use 
relevant tools and techniques 
in line with changing business 
priorities. 

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

3.3. Using evidence from 
research developing skills of 
healthcare workforce 
 

Staff lack the skills and 
resources to find, evaluate 
and use research evidence 
and best practice. 

Some teams access and apply 
digital and information skills 
training to equip staff to build 
the skills they need. 

Most healthcare staff have 
appropriate digital and 
information skills and use 
evidence to inform 
decisions and proposals. 

Confident and competent 
application of digital and 
health information skills is 
integral to the daily practice 
of staff.

Section 4: Knowledge Services 

Review the arrangements you have in place to use the expertise of knowledge specialists, access high quality evidence and the 
capacity you have available to undertake background research.  

 
Knowledge Services 1. Nothing in Place Yet 2. In Early Stages 3. Pockets of Good Practice 4. Business as Usual 

4.1. Access to a library and 
knowledge service - whether 
via an SLA or developed as an 
in-house service 

 

No service in place. Limited access to the national 
core collection of electronic 
resources using NHS 
OpenATHENS but no support 
from qualified librarians and 
knowledge specialists. 

Limited support from a 
qualified librarian to deliver 
generalised current 
awareness service and 
document delivery and/or to 
help with some searches. 

Full access with librarian 
aligned to teams and 
providing tailored current 
awareness, synthesised 
evidence summaries, 
training and facilitation to 
better mobilise knowledge.    

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

4.2.  Use of library and 
knowledge services  
 

No use made. Limited use of library and 
knowledge services by only 
a few staff. 

Wider use of library and 
knowledge services by more of 
the team but mainly to support 
education and continuing 
professional development. 

Full use.  Routine requests 
for evidence summaries, 
current awareness to 
support decision making, 
information skills training 
and facilitation to better 
mobilise knowledge.   

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 

4.3. Library and 
Knowledge Service 
alignment to 
organisational priorities  
 

There is no service in 
place. 

The library and knowledge 
services team is aware of 
current priorities 

The knowledge and library 
services team understands 
business priorities and routinely 
focuses their provision to meet 
shifting organisational priorities. 

Library and knowledge 
services are fully aligned to 
organisational priorities.

Knowledge Services 1. Nothing in Place Yet 2. In Early Stages 3. Pockets of Good Practice 4. Business as Usual 

4.4. Capacity to use 
evidence form research  

 

Staff carry out very few 
literature searches. 

Librarians and knowledge 
specialists are used to 
routinely conduct literature 
searches and are able to 
respond to some requests to 
collate and present research 
evidence. 

The knowledge service has 
streamlined functions to free 
up time for literature 
searching, synthesising and 
summarising research. The 
service has made the case to 
build additional capacity. 

The organisation is 
committed to securing 
appropriate knowledge 
services, so that staff can 
use evidence effectively.

Optional criteria if there is access to a Library and Knowledge Service: 

4.5. Capacity of Library 
and Knowledge services 
to  mobilise knowledge  
throughout the 
organisation 

Library and knowledge 
staff are focused on 
running traditional library 
functions. They may lack 
time for knowledge 
management initiatives. 

Some individuals invest time 
in centralising organisational 
knowledge resources and 
support teams to identify, 
share and make use of 
knowledge. 

The knowledge service has 
already streamlined functions 
and released time for 
knowledge activities. Where 
needed, the service is making 
the case to build additional 
capacity. 

The organisation is 
committed to securing 
appropriate knowledge 
services and creating some 
corporate resources, so staff 
can use knowledge 
effectively.
