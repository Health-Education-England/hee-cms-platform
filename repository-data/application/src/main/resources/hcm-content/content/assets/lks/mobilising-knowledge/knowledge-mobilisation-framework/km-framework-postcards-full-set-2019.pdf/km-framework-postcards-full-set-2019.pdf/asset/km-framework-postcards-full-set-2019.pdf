The NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework provides a set of tools and techniques to help people to 
learn before, during and after everything they do so that good practice can be replicated and pitfalls 
are avoided.

Knowledge Mobilisation Framework  
Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the ‘know-how’ of staff, using research evidence 
and implementing best practice are all business critical. Knowledge Mobilisation emphasises learning 
throughout an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after:

The tools and techniques of the Knowledge Mobilisation Framework facilitate learning 
and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.

Self-Assessment Tool: 
Using external evidence and organisational knowledge  

Speak to your NHS Library and Knowledge Service representative to facilitate use of the tool.  

1. Agree the capacity in which you are 
going to complete the framework 
– Individual, Team, Directorate, 
Organisation-wide viewpoint.

3. Read each criteria and identify the 
statement that best describes the 
current situation within your team or 
organisation.

4. Select the number that you feel best represents 
your current situation and identify where you 
would like to be.  

Work through sections 1-4 of the tool – 
Leadership, Behaviours, Capabilities & Working 
Practices, Knowledge Resources.

6. 5. Discuss your report with your NHS Library and 
Knowledge Service representative to prioritise 
initiatives, draw up an action plan and implement

A different way to see and be in the world, to learn and build on what we do well rather than focusing 
upon problems.   Appreciative Inquiry can generate ideas, energise changes and stimulate innovation 
on a large scale.

Appreciative Inquiry 

Use to celebrate what is already working well, analyse why and engage teams to do more of this to build 
upon past success and move towards the best future that can be imagined.    

1. Definition.  Frame the topic, what is the inquiry? 

3. Dream.  Small groups imagine what a positive outcome would look like.  What would we love to see 
happening? What’s different?  Energy is generated by expressing this future creatively.   

2. 

4. Design.  What must we do now to make our dreams a reality?  Think about actions, processes, systems, 
changes that could bring the dream into reality. 

Discovery. Be curious about how to build upon past success. What has worked well before and why?  
Capture each story in a single sentence. 

5. Delivery.  How will we take our topic forward? How will we measure success? Encourage  individuals to 
suggest ideas that they can own and take forward incrementally.

Before Action Review 15 mins to 
1/2 day

The Before Action Review helps a team state their intention (task, purpose and end-state) just before 
commencing the project, project stage or a piece of work, but also adds the discipline of predicting challenges 
and risks and, most important, drawing on lessons learned from past experiences.



Digital
Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Before Action Review: 

A short preview session that considers what issues  
might arise during a piece of work - anything  
ranging from a workshop to a project stage.

Preparation: Conduct  before the event  leaving 
enough time to act upon what you might decide 
- appoint someone as facilitator.

1. What are we setting out to achieve? 
Why are we taking this action? Who’s 
doing what? What challenges and 
risks can we anticipate?

 

3. What will help deliver success?  
How might we know if the 
action works?

2. What can be learned from similar situations  
and past projects from elsewhere? 
What is the advice of others who have done 
this? What have we learnt from similar 
situations? What do the lessons learned tell us? 

4. What are the actions we need to take to 
avoid problems and apply good practice?
What is most important for, and will help 
deliver success?

Fishbowl conversations are a useful technique for debating “hot topics” or sharing ideas and knowledge from 

a variety of perspectives.   They can be used as an alternative to the traditional panel discussion or debate 

enabling more dynamic participation. 

Fishbowl 1.5 hrs



Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Fishbowl 

• Appoint a facilitator and scribe

• Arrange an outer circle with easy access to  
 three or four chairs in the inner circle

• Identify a stimulating question for discussion

• Identify and brief your inner-circle participants  
 that will start the discussion

• Adapt your fishbowl to ensure it is fully   
 inclusive and everybody can take part

• Use a prop to ensure only one person speaks  
 at a time – a toy fish works well

• Observers may also take notes

Preparation: 

Tips: 

The facilitator explains the fishbowl, poses the 
question and invites the inner circle participants to 
take turns expressing their view.

In an open fishbowl those who would like to join 
the conversation may do so by occupying the spare 
chair in the inner circle.  When a new person joins 
someone else should leave.  

The scribe captures the key points raised in the 
discussion and presents these back at the end of the 
session.

The facilitator invites others to join the conversation, 
manages the time and leads a short debrief about 
the effectiveness of the technique at the end.

A short structured meeting held immediately after a short term activity such  as a task within a project, for 

example, a training session, a go live day or an engagement meeting. Usually facilitated by one of the team 

members, all who were involved in the ‘action’ should participate in the After Action Review.

After Action Review 

Capture the lessons learned in the lessons learned repository for the benefit of others

A short learning session held immediately after a  
discrete piece of work such as a process mapping  
workshop or a training session.

Preparation: Conduct immediately following the 
event and involve everyone who took part in the 
‘action’ - appoint someone as facilitator.

1. What was supposed to happen?

3. Why was there a difference?
What caused the results?

2. What actually happened?
What went well and what could have 
been done better?

4. What can we learn from this?
What actions can be taken to 
improve or sustain what went well?

Knowledge Cafés 

Knowledge Cafés encourage productive conversations to help people learn from each other. They can help 
people to solve problems, break down silos, drive  innovation and build a community. The value of the Café is 
in the conversation itself and the learning that each individual takes away.

1–2 hours



Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Knowledge Cafés 

• Spend time devising a single open-ended   
 question to stimulate conversations

• Invite participants (between 12 – 24 people  
 is ideal)

• Arrange your room with small round tables  
 that can seat 4/5 people.

An invited speaker can introduce the theme but 
this should be limited to 15 minutes to allow 
adequate time for the conversation to take 
place.

If time is short consider running a 30 minute 
Espresso Café.

Options:

Before the Session: 

Facilitator explains how the café will run, 
introduces the theme and poses the question.

The small groups are invited to have a self-
facilitated conversation based upon the question. 

After 15 minutes groups are invited to swap tables 
to begin new conversations, meet new people and 
get different perspectives on the question.

After 45 minutes come back together as a full 
group to share ideas and learning from the 
conversations that have taken place. Individuals 
may suggest an actionable insight if appropriate.

If the group agrees, ideas from the conversation 
can  be captured and shared after the session but 
this must not inhibit the conversation.

Randomised Coffee Trials 30 mins

Randomised coffee trials enable people to meet and connect with one another at random, giving them 
time to talk about whatever they wish, perhaps over a cup of coffee. Randomised coffee trials help to build 
relationships, improve communication, encourage collaboration, sharing knowledge and ideas.



Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Randomised Coffee Trials 

•  Recruit senior leaders

•  The co-ordinator can re-match pairs to ensure   
 participants get to meet someone new

•  Although usually used in a single organisation  
 Randomised Coffee Trial can be run across  
 organisations or professional groups

•  You can give pairs questions to prompt   
 conversation but there are no rules

•  The co-ordinator may choose to arrange  
 a time and a place for conversations to  
 take place

Before the Session: 

The co-ordinator invites people to join the trial.

Randomly match people to pairs using a 
spreadsheet or online random group creator.

Tell people who they are paired with.

Give them 6–8 weeks to arrange to meet for 30  
minutes. Ideally this would be face to face but it 
can be virtual over Skype or phone.

Send a reminder to ask people to meet and ask  
for feedback.

Share the success and ask the organisation if they  
want to do it again.

Communities of Practice Anytime, 
anywhere

A Community of Practice is a group of individuals who come together to share ideas, develop expertise and 
solve problems around a topic of interest. Communities of  practice can be made up of people across the NHS 
and beyond, so that knowledge is shared and re-used widely.



Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Communities of Practice

Three Characteristics of a Community of Practice

1. The Domain

An identity defined by a shared domain of interest 
– similar roles or expertise

2. The Community

Interaction and learning together members of the 
community engage in joint activities and discussions, 
help each other and share information.

3. The Practice

Developing stories, cases, documents and lessons 
learnt  to inform shared practice. Building a 
knowledge base.

1. Planning: Is there a need? Is there a common purpose? 
Who will be core members?

2. Creating: How will you recruit? How will you 
encourage interaction – in person or virtually?  
What tools will you use to support the Community?

3. Building the knowledge base: How will you capture 
and present knowledge from experience? Will you 
provide an alerting service to keep members up-to-date?

4. Reviewing: Is your community still relevant and 
meeting needs? Does the community need to evolve into 
something new? If no longer active does the community 
need to be closed and the knowledge archived?

Action Learning Sets 

Tips:

•  Organise a series of regular action learning sets at a  
 time and place where everyone can attend.

•  Come to the set with a real-life issue that you want   
 to solve.

•  Appoint a facilitator from within the group.

•  Adopt active, attentive listening.

•  Create a supportive confidential environment.

•  Focus on questioning to help an individual  
 understand  the issue and identify the action  
 they will take forward.

•  Use open questions – avoid closed, leading and    
 multiple questions.

Report In. Be open and honest about feelings,  
pre-occupations and provide an update on key actions  
taken since the previous set.

Bidding. Individuals take turns to present their current issue  
and indicate level of need.

Presentation. The presenter outlines their issue or challenge

Questions and Actions. The group ask questions in turn to  
help the presenter come to a deeper understanding to review  
options and decide on actions.

Optional “Gift” Round. The presenter may request each 
person  to express their personal opinion, comment or advice. 
There is  no discussion.

Learning and Review. In turn share learning from the round  
and then review the action learning set process.

Knowledge and experience, captured and packaged in one place to be of maximum use to  people who could 
benefit from that learning in the future. Knowledge Assets may contain key lessons learned, case histories, 
key contacts and best practice.

Knowledge Assets Create, use, update



Digital
Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Knowledge Assets 

1.  Identify an audience for your knowledge asset

2.  Ensure there is clarity about what the  
 knowledge asset is all about

3.  Ideally a knowledge asset should be owned by  
 a community of practice

4.  Collate existing material and design  
 the structure

5.  Add context to allow users to understand   
 purpose and relevance of the knowledge asset

6.  Add navigational aids

7.  Emphasise links to people

8.  Validate the knowledge asset

9.  Publish it!

10. Maintain it

Knowledge Assets should be exciting, enticing, easy to read and easy to assimilate. The knowledge needs  
to be presented in bite-sized chunks, in an intuitive way, illustrated with diagrams, videos and pictures,  
and easily cross referenced.

Knowledge Harvesting 4 hours

A structured approach to help an organisation understand and record the knowledge and experience of 
people, often before they leave or move roles.



Digital
Email: KFH.england@hee.nhs.uk

https://rebrand.ly/KMTEL

Knowledge Harvesting:

The key stages in knowledge harvesting are;

• Identification of key knowledge areas

• Confirmation of the individuals who have this   
 key knowledge

• Preparation for the knowledge harvest

• Knowledge harvest interview, typically 4 hours

• Initial packaging of the material

• Approval of the material by the interviewee

• Creation and then publication of the   
 knowledge asset

Consult the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS 
Trust knowledge retention and transfer leaver’s  
toolkit https://rebrand.ly/sashleavertk.

How to undertake a knowledge harvesting 
interview:

1. Start early

The whole process from identifying an interviewee 
to launching a knowledge asset typically takes  
around 7 weeks.

2. Ask the right questions

Input from the recipients for the expert’s knowledge 
helps to ensure the knowledge asset will be of 
maximum benefit to them.

3. Decide the best way to package this knowledge

Make the harvested knowledge available for the 
organisation or team as a knowledge asset.

Invite all the people and key stakeholders 
who were involved.

1. What was the objective of the project?
What did or didn’t we achieve? Why?

What were the disappointments Why?
How can we or others avoid them  
in the future?

2. What were the successes? Why?
How can we or others repeat the 
success in the future?

3. 4. Marks out of 10 for the project  
as a whole?
What would have made it a 10?
