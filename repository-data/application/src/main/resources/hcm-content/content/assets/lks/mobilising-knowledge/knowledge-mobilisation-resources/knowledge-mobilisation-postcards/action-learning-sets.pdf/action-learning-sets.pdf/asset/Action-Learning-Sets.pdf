Action Learning Sets 

Tips:

•  Organise a series of regular action learning sets at a  
 time and place where everyone can attend.

•  Come to the set with a real-life issue that you want   
 to solve.

•  Appoint a facilitator from within the group.

•  Adopt active, attentive listening.

•  Create a supportive confidential environment.

•  Focus on questioning to help an individual  
 understand  the issue and identify the action  
 they will take forward.

•  Use open questions – avoid closed, leading and    
 multiple questions.

Report In. Be open and honest about feelings,  
pre-occupations and provide an update on key actions  
taken since the previous set.

Bidding. Individuals take turns to present their current issue  
and indicate level of need.

Presentation. The presenter outlines their issue or challenge

Questions and Actions. The group ask questions in turn to  
help the presenter come to a deeper understanding to review  
options and decide on actions.

Optional “Gift” Round. The presenter may request each 
person  to express their personal opinion, comment or advice. 
There is  no discussion.

Learning and Review. In turn share learning from the round  
and then review the action learning set process.
