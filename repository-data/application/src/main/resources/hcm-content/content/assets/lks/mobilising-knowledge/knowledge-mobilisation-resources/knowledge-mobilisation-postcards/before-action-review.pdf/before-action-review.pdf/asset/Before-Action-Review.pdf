Before Action Review 15 mins to 
1/2 day

The Before Action Review helps a team state their intention (task, purpose and end-state) just before 
commencing the project, project stage or a piece of work, but also adds the discipline of predicting challenges 
and risks and, most important, drawing on lessons learned from past experiences.

Before Action Review: 

A short preview session that considers what issues  
might arise during a piece of work - anything  
ranging from a workshop to a project stage.

Preparation: Conduct  before the event  leaving 
enough time to act upon what you might decide 
- appoint someone as facilitator.

1. What are we setting out to achieve? 
Why are we taking this action? Whoâ€™s 
doing what? What challenges and 
risks can we anticipate?

 

3. What will help deliver success?  
How might we know if the 
action works?

2. What can be learned from similar situations  
and past projects from elsewhere? 
What is the advice of others who have done 
this? What have we learnt from similar 
situations? What do the lessons learned tell us? 

4. What are the actions we need to take to 
avoid problems and apply good practice?
What is most important for, and will help 
deliver success?
