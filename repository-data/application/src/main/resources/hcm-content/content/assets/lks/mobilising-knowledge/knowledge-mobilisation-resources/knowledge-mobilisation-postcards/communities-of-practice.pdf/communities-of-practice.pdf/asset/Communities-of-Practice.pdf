Communities of Practice Anytime, 
anywhere

A Community of Practice is a group of individuals who come together to share ideas, develop expertise and 
solve problems around a topic of interest. Communities of  practice can be made up of people across the NHS 
and beyond, so that knowledge is shared and re-used widely.

Communities of Practice

Three Characteristics of a Community of Practice

1. The Domain

An identity defined by a shared domain of interest 
– similar roles or expertise

2. The Community

Interaction and learning together members of the 
community engage in joint activities and discussions, 
help each other and share information.

3. The Practice

Developing stories, cases, documents and lessons 
learnt  to inform shared practice. Building a 
knowledge base.

1. Planning: Is there a need? Is there a common purpose? 
Who will be core members?

2. Creating: How will you recruit? How will you 
encourage interaction – in person or virtually?  
What tools will you use to support the Community?

3. Building the knowledge base: How will you capture 
and present knowledge from experience? Will you 
provide an alerting service to keep members up-to-date?

4. Reviewing: Is your community still relevant and 
meeting needs? Does the community need to evolve into 
something new? If no longer active does the community 
need to be closed and the knowledge archived?
