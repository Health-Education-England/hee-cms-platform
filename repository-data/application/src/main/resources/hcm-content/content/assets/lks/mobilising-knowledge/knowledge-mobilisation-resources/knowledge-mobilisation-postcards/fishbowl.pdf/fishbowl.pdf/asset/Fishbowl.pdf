Fishbowl conversations are a useful technique for debating “hot topics” or sharing ideas and knowledge from 

a variety of perspectives.   They can be used as an alternative to the traditional panel discussion or debate 

enabling more dynamic participation.

Fishbowl 

• Appoint a facilitator and scribe

• Arrange an outer circle with easy access to  
 three or four chairs in the inner circle

• Identify a stimulating question for discussion

• Identify and brief your inner-circle participants  
 that will start the discussion

• Adapt your fishbowl to ensure it is fully   
 inclusive and everybody can take part

• Use a prop to ensure only one person speaks  
 at a time – a toy fish works well

• Observers may also take notes

Preparation: 

Tips: 

The facilitator explains the fishbowl, poses the 
question and invites the inner circle participants to 
take turns expressing their view.

In an open fishbowl those who would like to join 
the conversation may do so by occupying the spare 
chair in the inner circle.  When a new person joins 
someone else should leave.  

The scribe captures the key points raised in the 
discussion and presents these back at the end of the 
session.

The facilitator invites others to join the conversation, 
manages the time and leads a short debrief about 
the effectiveness of the technique at the end.

A Fishbowl can be “open” where anyone can join the discussion or “closed” where a group of experts debate 
the question observed by an outer circle of observers
