Randomised Coffee Trials 30 mins

Randomised coffee trials enable people to meet and connect with one another at random, giving them 
time to talk about whatever they wish, perhaps over a cup of coffee. Randomised coffee trials help to build 
relationships, improve communication, encourage collaboration, sharing knowledge and ideas.

Randomised Coffee Trials 

•  Recruit senior leaders

•  The co-ordinator can re-match pairs to ensure   
 participants get to meet someone new

•  Although usually used in a single organisation  
 Randomised Coffee Trial can be run across  
 organisations or professional groups

•  You can give pairs questions to prompt   
 conversation but there are no rules

•  The co-ordinator may choose to arrange  
 a time and a place for conversations to  
 take place

Before the Session: 

The co-ordinator invites people to join the trial.

Randomly match people to pairs using a 
spreadsheet or online random group creator.

Tell people who they are paired with.

Give them 6–8 weeks to arrange to meet for 30  
minutes. Ideally this would be face to face but it 
can be virtual over Skype or phone.

Send a reminder to ask people to meet and ask  
for feedback.

Share the success and ask the organisation if they  
want to do it again.
