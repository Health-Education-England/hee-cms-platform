How will your Library and knowledge 

Service support local STPs? 

How will you make your Library 

and Knowledge Services an 

essential resource for the 

STPs? 

 

How can you collaborate more 

closely with other Library 

and Knowledge Services 

colleagues to achieve this?

Sustainability and Transformation Plans 

• The NHS Five Year Forward View Shared Planning 
Guidance required every local health and care system in 
England to create a Sustainability and Transformation Plan 
(STP). 

• These will be place-based, multi-year plans built around the 
needs of local populations. 

• STPs will drive transformation in health and care outcomes 
between 2016 and 2021. 

• They will help strengthen local relationships and better 
enable a shared understanding of how we can best deliver 
the FYFV.

• To deliver these plans, NHS providers, CCGs, Local Authorities, 

and other health and care services have come together to form 

44 STP ‘footprints’.  

• These footprints are of a scale that should enable the 

transformation required to implement the Five Year Forward 

View’s vision of health, quality care, and efficiency. 

• The STP footprints will not cover all planning eventualities – there 

are layers of plans that sit above and below STPs. 

• STP boundaries may change over time in line with local 

circumstances.

The 44 English Geographies 

In forming their footprints, local areas will 

have taken the following factors into 

account:  

• Geography (including patient flow, 

travel, and how people use services);  

• Scale (the ability to deliver sustainable, 

transformed, and financially sound 

health and care);  

• Fit with footprints of existing change 

programmes and relationships;  

• The financial sustainability of 

organisations in an area;  

• Leadership capacity and capability to 

support change.

Leadership 

 
Each footprint has a leader from the system  

“These are individuals who command both the support 

of their local colleagues and the national leadership 

bodies of the NHS, and whose efforts alongside 

colleagues will collectively help transform health and 

care over the next few years. 

The leaders come from a good mix of backgrounds, and 

include provider chief executives, CCG accountable 

officers, local authority senior leaders and clinicians, 

recognising the need for local systems to work in 

partnership. “

Each STP area was asked to make a submission by 15 April focusing on the following 

two questions: 

 

a. What leadership, decision-making processes and supporting resources you have 

put in place to make progress? 

 

b. What are the major areas of focus and big decisions you will need to make as a 

system to drive transformation? 
 

 

The April 15th checkpoint: Summary 

 

 

Different areas will be starting from different places 

 

• Many areas will have already undertaken considerable amounts of work. 

• They were to build on this work –  and fill the gaps, not redo what they’d already done.

The April 15th checkpoint:  

agreeing areas of focus for each STP 
 

A full STP will need to be underpinned by  

• an understanding of your current major local challenges against the ‘3 gaps’ (health 

and wellbeing, care and quality, and finance and efficiency); 

• how those challenges are expected to evolve over the next 5 years in a ‘do nothing 

scenario‘; 

• emerging hypotheses for what is driving the gaps and therefore the action needed. 

 

National priorities and local challenges 

 

• The STP process is intended  to be a process for partners across a footprint to 

work together to identify, agree and address significant challenges. It is not a 

checklist exercise. 

 

• 10 key areas where we know we need to make progress across the health and care 

system. Reflecting on these 10 areas, footprints need to be identifying key local 

priorities for transformation 

@NHS_HealthEdEng  #HEELKS  http://tinyurl.com/zfwu7p6 



The Local Workforce Action Boards will be responsible for 

delivering 4 key pieces of work in the coming months 

• A comprehensive baseline of the NHS and social care workforce within the STP 

footprint and an overarching assessment of the key issues that the relevant 

labour markets(s) present. This will describe the workforce case for change. 

 

• A scenario based, high level workforce strategy that sets out the workforce 

implications of the STP’s ambitions in terms of numbers and skills, including 

leadership development. 

 

• A workforce transformation plan focused on what is needed to deliver the service 

ambitions set out in the STP. 

 

• An action plan that proposes the necessary investment in workforce required to 

support STP delivery, identifying sources of funds to enable its implementation.

The big question 

There are 10 big questions for 

STPs 

 

The big question for Library & 

Knowledge Services is:- 

 How can we help deliver 

these plans?  

@NHS_HealthEdEng  #HEELKS  http://tinyurl.com/zfwu7p6 



10 big questions  – what are the priorities 

for the STP? (1/2) 
 
 
 How are you going to prevent ill health and moderate demand for 

healthcare?  

 

 How are you engaging patients, communities and NHS staff?  

 

 How will you support, invest in and improve general practice? 

 

 How will you implement new care models that address local 

challenges?  

 

 How will you achieve and maintain performance against core 

standards?

10 big questions  – what are the priorities 

for the STP? (2/2) 
 
 

 

 How will you achieve our 2020 ambitions on key clinical priorities? 

 

 How will you improve quality and safety?  

 

 How will you deploy technology to accelerate change? 

 

 How will you develop the workforce you need to deliver? 

 

 How will you achieve and maintain financial balance?

The big question 

The big question for Library & 

Knowledge Services is:- 

• How can we help support the planning 
phase and then the delivery of STPs? 

• What evidence, best practice and data 
is needed?  

• Given local circumstances, where do 
we need to focus to best support the 
priorities of the health and care 
system? 

 
@NHS_HealthEdEng  #HEELKS  http://tinyurl.com/zfwu7p6 



STPs are an opportunity to develop a 

local route map to an improved, more 

sustainable, health and care system 

44 STP footprints have been agreed 

 

• Each will be convened by a local leader, 

backed by national bodies 

• Footprints are not statutory boundaries – 

they are vehicles for collaboration  

• Planning will still need take place at 

different levels - subsidiarity is a key 

principle 

 

A good STP focuses on the big questions and 

early action 
 

• Get going on some early actions rather than 

waiting for the plan to be complete 

• As ‘umbrella’ plans, STPs can be a way of 

making sense of competing priorities 

• Think about populations, not institutions or 

organisational form 

• Spend time on identifying the practical 

opportunities and solutions, not endlessly 

debating the scale of the challenge 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It won’t be easy 
 

• There will be technical challenges, e.g. 

o Cross-footprint flows and boundaries 

o Incentives that pull in different directions 

• Non-technical challenges, e.g.  

o Building meaningful relationships 

o Freeing people to focus on the long-term  

o Moving quickly, whilst ensuring buy-in 

 

 

 

 
 

This is an opportunity to build or strengthen 

relationships 
 

 

• Across health, social care and local government 

– but also with patients, communities, staff and 

the voluntary sector 

• STPs aren’t all about writing the plan: building 

energy, relationships and collaborative leadership 

is even more important 

• Trust and ownership is crucial for implementation

How to respond? 

Colleagues in the East of England discussed their approach and decided 

on these actions:  

1. Contact key players with the messages  

“We are here, how can we help?” “We can help deliver the plans by….” 

2. Mapping our own services to the STP footprints and working more 

collaboratively to help deliver the plans, prioritising local needs. 

3. Develop a local model for LKS, for example LKS Essex merger pilot. 

4. Stakeholder mapping 

5. Comms plan using their language:- 

“We’re working together with you” “We’re tailoring the information for 

you” “We’re part of the team”

Your next steps – 30 days 

Plans need to  be completed by July 2016 

 

• Who do you need to contact?
