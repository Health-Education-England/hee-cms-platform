Working well together  
 
The dialogue which occurs between set members within an action learning set is different 
from a usual social or even a work based conversation.  As such it is helpful to be explicit 
about the values and rules which will ensure that all set members can participate fully.  

 

Guidelines for working together   
 
The following guidelines are intended to help set members to feel confident and to work 
openly and effectively within the set. 
 

– Maintain confidentiality – the detail of what happens in the set and any personal 
information is confidential.  Decisions and plans can be communicated and acted on 
outside the set. 

 

– Listen actively to everyone 

 

– Accept responsibility for your own learning and development 

 

– Share time equally in the set 

 

– Bring issues with the set to set meetings rather than complain to outsiders  

 

– Be respectful of difference  – difference can be enriching  

 
We may develop additional agreements to support our work in this specific set.

Roles and responsibilities in a set  
 
Set advisor  
 
Action learning sets can be self-facilitated or have an external set advisor. 
 
The role and responsibilities of the set advisor include: 
 

– Helping to establish the climate for learning and development  
 
– Managing the timetable and agenda for the meetings 

 
– Enabling the group to focus on learning and development 

 
– Demonstrating the skills of action learning  

 
– Helping the set members to develop skills for self- facilitation  

 
 
In addition the set advisor may also be able to identify and signpost set members to 
information and resources which are beyond the immediate experience in the set. 
 
The set advisor is does not act as a teacher or trainer in the action learning set model.  
 
 
Set members    
Within the action learning framework set members take two significant and different roles;  
 Peer supporters and learning facilitators  
 Presenters of issues and problems  
Both are active and skilful roles. 
 
Peer supporters  
The core task for supporters is to help the presenter by asking questions which offer the 
potential for insight and new perspectives on the issue or problem being presented. 
 
Presenters  
Presenting an issue in order to get the maximum value from the action learning set requires 
some skill and planning. 
 
Log sheets are a useful way to reflect and highlight issues which could be explored further. 
 
Because this is a formal dialogue with peers there are some skills to develop in order to 
make the most of it.

In particular it is helpful to know -  
 
How to ask for what you want – help the set to help you.   
For example – ‘ I would like your questions to focus on generating new ideas on how else I 
can approach this’  
 
How to get an empathetic response – sharing feelings enables set members to really 
understand the impact and significance of your issue.   
For example – ‘I feel a bit overwhelmed by the enormity of what I have to do’  
 
Take control of the process – having asked for what you want – then be assertive if the 
questioning or discussion goes too far away from this need to be useful to you.   
For example – ‘While that is an interesting question/comment – what I really need now is 
to focus on …’ 
 
How to receive feedback and support – listening openly and without responding with ‘yes 
– but…’.  Sometimes it is helpful just to hear perhaps write ideas which may not have an 
immediate or comfortable resonance. 
For example – ‘I notice I am resisting that – let me make a note and reflect on it further’ 
 
What is effective presenting – how to describe your issues and how to use limited time 
most effectively  
 
 
 
 
    Example of a framework for a 30 minute slot   
 
    Stage 1. Presenter talks about  
              Actions and insights as a result of last meeting  
              What they want from this meeting  
 
    This usually takes 5-10 minutes  
 
 
    Stage 2. Set members use insightful questioning to help the presenter 
    to identify options, new ideas, other perspectives etc on their issues  
 
    This usually takes 15 – 20 minutes  
 
    Stage 3. Presenter reflects on the questions and any insights or ideas  
    gained and forms a plan of action to take before the next learning set  
    meeting   
 
   This usually takes 5 minutes

There are many techniques and tools which the presenter can use to gain ideas and insights 
in their time slot (see below).  What is essential in all of them is that the presenter actively 
states what they most need from set members.  

Examples of ways to use the time slot as a presenter  

Use the flipchart to present and illustrate your issues  
 
Ask the set to brainstorm possible ways to deal with your issue or question 
 
Ask the set to stay quiet as you present – not asking questions – but giving you the space to 
think out loud.  When you have finished talking you then ask set members from any 
observations they have.  Don’t debate the suggestions – just hear them and evaluate them 
in respect of your issue.  
 
Ask for specific suggestions for dealing with a situation where you feel bereft of suggestions 
– again don’t debate them – hear them – take what, if anything,  is useful and ignore what 
is not  
 
Ask the set to discuss your issue for x minutes while you observe.

Asking questions 
As a set member, you will find that simple questions are often the most powerful in terms 
of results.  Set members can be very effective just using these questions, for example: 

Core questions 

o What do you want? 

o How will you get there? 

o What’s the first step? 

o What could get in the way? 

o What do you need? 

o When will you start? 

o What’s a realistic timescale? 

o What will you learn from that? 

o What works (or worked) for you? 

o How could you change that? 

o What’s the positive opposite of that for you? 

o What would that give you? 

o What does it look like from (the other person’s) position? 

o Who can support/assist you? 

Notice that questions are generally short and they are also open (i.e. they require more 
than yes or no for an answer). 

It is important to allow the Presenter sufficient time to answer each question. Also when 
asking challenging questions, use your tone of voice and body language so that the 
Presenter still feels encouraged and accepted. 
 
Remember… as a Set member you are asking questions which move the Presenter on with 
their issue, (in terms of deepening their understanding or helping them to explore it) not 
questions to satisfy your own curiosity or to get further into the details of the problem.   
 
The kinds of questions which do this best are the ones which encourage the Presenter to 
reflect and to start to ask themselves questions.

Helpful types of questions in action learning  
 
 
OPEN  
 

 
Can’t be answered with a yes or no but 
encourages the presenter to open up a 
dialogue; creates an open space  

 
How did you tackle that? 

 
REFLECTIVE  

 
Reflects back something which has been 
expressed to enable presenter to consider 
the impact. Encourages new insights. 

 
You looked very energised  
when you said that – I 
wonder what that might say 
about the project now? 

 
CLARIFYING  

 
Helps listener check the meaning of what 
they have heard; allows presenter to hear 
what others have heard. Can add insights 
for presenters  

 
Is what you are saying? 

 
COMPARATIVE  

 
A form of closed question which 
encourages presenter to reflect  

 
What might make you choose 
option A over option B? 
 

 
PRECISION  

 
Useful to flesh out details and help 
presenter understand the issue in more 
depth 

 
How exactly did that happen? 
Everyone? 
Always? 

 
Unhelpful questions  
Because the intention of action learning is to support and facilitate the development of the 
presenter there are some sorts of questions which may be acceptable in ‘social situations 
which are less useful in this context.   
 

 
LEADING  

 
Where the questioner already knows 
what answer they expect and leads the 
presenter to give this response 

 
Don’t you think that the best 
way to do this is ….? 

 
MULTIPLE  

 
A series of questions, one after the other, 
presenter answers only one.  Often 
indicates an anxiety or confusion in the 
questioner – and serves to transfer this 
to the presenter  

 
When did you first know that, 
what did you do at that 
stage, what did they say and 
how did you get them to 
agree?

 The following groups of questions may help you to identify some useful ways to support 
and challenge presenters.    

Project focused questions 

Here the intention is to help the presenter reflect on aspects of their project and to identify 
ways forward based on new understanding. 

o What problems does that raise? 
o How is that a problem? 
o What is/isn’t happening now? 
o What do you want to be different? 
o How would you like X to respond? 
o How does Y need to change? 
o How will that help? 
o Who else can you involve? 

 

Feeling focused questions 

Here the intention is to help the presenter reflect on and anticipate the emotional impact 
of what they are doing. 

o How are feeling about this? 
o What worries you about it? 
o What excites you most? 
o What’s your fantasy about this? 
o How honest are you being with yourself? 
o How realistic are you being with yourself? 
o What do you know that you’ll realise a year from now? 

 

Questions about the set processes 

Here the intention is to enable the presenter to get what she or he needs form the set and 
to give set members feedback to improve their effectiveness 

o What else would you find helpful? 
o How can we help you? 
o Are we addressing the question/issue? 
o Are we being helpful? 
o What have we learned? 
o What went well? 
o What could we do better? 

 
There are also some useful questions for times when you don’t know where to go next in 
order to help the presenter: 

o Where do we go from here? 

o What would you like now? 

o What would help?
