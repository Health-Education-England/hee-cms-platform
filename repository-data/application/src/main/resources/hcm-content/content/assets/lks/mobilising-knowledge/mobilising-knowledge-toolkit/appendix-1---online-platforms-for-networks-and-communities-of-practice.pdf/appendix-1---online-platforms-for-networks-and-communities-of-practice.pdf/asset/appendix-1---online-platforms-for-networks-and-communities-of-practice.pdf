Communities of Practice (COP) 

 

 

 
“Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern, a 

set of problems or a passion about a topic and who deepen their 
knowledge and expertise by interacting on an ongoing basis”1 

 
 

The literature shows that in educational settings it is not the technology that 
makes a network or COP successful.2 Using existing networks, where people 
already know each other, and combining technology with face-to-face 
engagement, is more a successful approach. On the next pages are some 
existing platforms you might want to consider. 

 
 

It is recommended that you: 
 
 

• Establish a code of conduct and identify priorities 
• Select a technology that is based on user need (consider digital literacy 

skills) 
• Select something intuitive and user-friendly 
• Have at least one dedicated site administrator (two is preferable) 
• Post regularly 
• Document lessons learned23 

 
Levels of participation will vary within the group, but the coordinators should take 
responsibility for ensuring the site stays vibrant and up-to-date.
