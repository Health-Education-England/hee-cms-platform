Knowledge Harvesting 4 hours

A structured approach to help an organisation understand and 
record the knowledge and experience of people, often before 
they leave or move roles.



Knowledge Harvesting:

The key stages in knowledge harvesting are;

• Identification of key knowledge areas

• Confirmation of the individuals who have this   
 key knowledge

• Preparation for the knowledge harvest

• Knowledge harvest interview, typically 4 hours

• Initial packaging of the material

• Approval of the material by the interviewee

• Creation and then publication of the   
 knowledge asset

Trust knowledge retention and transfer leaver’s  
toolkit  link below.

How to undertake a knowledge harvesting 
interview:

1. Start early

The whole process from identifying an interviewee 
to launching a knowledge asset typically takes  
around 7 weeks.

2. Ask the right questions

Input from the recipients for the expert’s knowledge 
helps to ensure the knowledge asset will be of 
maximum benefit to them.

3. Decide the best way to package this knowledge

Make the harvested knowledge available for the 
organisation or team as a knowledge asset.
