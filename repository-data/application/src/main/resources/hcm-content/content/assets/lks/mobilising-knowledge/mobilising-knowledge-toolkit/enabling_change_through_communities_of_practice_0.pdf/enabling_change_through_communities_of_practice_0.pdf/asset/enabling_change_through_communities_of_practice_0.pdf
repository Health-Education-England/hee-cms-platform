Foreword
Enabling large scale change: 
Reflections on the role of communities 
of practice
I am delighted to provide the foreword for this important learning paper on 
communities of practice. I hope that the gems of practical wisdom from Wellbeing 
Our Way described within the paper will inspire many other people to join in with 
learning communities because being in a community of practice is one of the 
most effective and enjoyable ways to learn. 

I’ve been a change agent in public service for more than 30 years and I have 
been a member and/or facilitator of many communities of practice, in topics as 
diverse as improving care for people with cancer to people with a passion for 
statistical process control. Some of these communities have been short lived and 
others have lasted for a decade or more. Many of my experiences mirror those in 
this paper. 

Here are five reasons why I am such a great enthusiast for communities of practice:

1. There are so many change agents out there in local 
communities and in the formal care system making a big 
difference in people’s lives, but too often their learning and 
wisdom don’t get shared. 

As a result, we are constantly solving the same problems that other people 
have solved before. If we could ratchet up the numbers of communities of 
practice across the country (and through digital means across the world), 
we could be using more of our greatest assets for change, our community 
members and potential activists, instead of waiting for the formal system to 
make the changes we need for us. 

2. Community is a place where people come together to share 
problems, solutions and stories. 

Community is where magic happens. We are recognising this in the world of 
health and care, where we are increasingly joining up care systems to meet 
people’s needs in local communities and places. Communities of practice

are a learning and sharing version of community. We can apply the same 
principles of shared purpose, sense of belonging and community spirit. 
Where we do this well, and I have experienced it many times, communities of 
practice can ignite an unstoppable energy for change.

3. Communities of practice focus on tacit knowledge which 
is knowledge that is learnt practically from actually doing 
things. 

Tacit knowledge is the most powerful kind of knowledge that is most likely 
to deliver results. However, it is very difficult to capture tacit knowledge and 
turn it into explicit knowledge, which is knowledge that has been translated 
into a guideline or best practice principle. That is why, in my experience, 
communities of practice, where people can discuss and share their 
experiences with people with common interests, are a more effective way to 
spread change than improvement toolkits or best practice databases.

4. Many years of leading change have taught me that it is very 
hard to make change happen from the middle or top of an 
existing system. 

To quote Gary Hamel, “change always starts from the fringes and it always 
starts with the activists”. The best place to be to enable change is at the 
edge of your system or organisation. This paper describes how communities 
of practice within Wellbeing Our Way worked “at the very edge of existing 
knowledge and practice”. The very nature of a community of practice takes 
us to the edge. 

Communities of practice enable us to have one foot in our organisation or 
local system and another foot in the wider world of people with the same 
interests and goals. They help us to see all kinds of possibilities that we 
wouldn’t see otherwise and to connect things in ways that we couldn’t do if 
we were at the centre. We can pull new ideas, skills and experiences from our 
communities of practice into the heart of our organisations and systems.

5. The best communities of practice encourage diversity which 
is critical to innovation and improvement. 

They challenge the idea that there is “one right way” of doing things, rather 
helping us build learning communities where people feel accepted, are 
comfortable contributing ideas and actively seek to learn from each other. I 
have experienced this leading to more disruptive thinking, faster change and 
better outcomes on multiple occasions.



3

Of course communities of practice are not a “magic bullet”, nor are they the 
answer to all our change challenges. As with any approach to learning and 
change, they need to be well led and supported to get the most of everyone’s 
contributions. 

Like any other kind of community, a community of practice is about relationships 
and they need to be nurtured, invested in and constantly reviewed. Multiple 
members of the community need to commit to the community’s future or it won’t 
last long. It can take a lot of effort but the results are usually worth it. 

As Wellbeing Our Way has shown, communities of practice can be places where 
new ideas germinate, new methods and approaches can be developed and new 
connections and communities can be rooted. They can also help to grow leaders 
through peer to peer support, informal mentoring and participation in groups and 
communities.

So here’s to growing this capability throughout the health and care system 
across all our formal and informal connections; and here’s to many, many more 
communities of practice within health and care where sharing, learning and 
collaboration can flourish.

Wellbeing Our Way: A legacy
When National Voices embarked on Wellbeing Our Way, we did not foresee our 
communities of practice.  Indeed we barely understood that concept.  We wanted 
to help people in our sector share learning on how to enable patients take more 
control.  The communities of practice approach emerged organically.  That is 
what happens when you work in partnership.  Your journey and your destination 
are not what you first envisaged. It is an important lesson about making change. 
You cannot at the same time pre-determine the outcome and have a genuinely 
collaborative process.

National Voices is passionate about people being partners in decisions that affect 
their health and their care.  Not only is it the right thing to do, but there is growing 
evidence that it leads to better results. In our nearly ten year history we have had 
success in influencing national policy, legislation and system design.  We were 
signatories to the NHS Constitution. We helped secure a legal duty of patient 
involvement in the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.  Our ‘I statements’ describing 
what good looks like from the point of view of the patient became part of the 
official definition of integrated care in 2013. We helped to shape the Five Year 
Forward View vision of a ‘new relationship with patients and communities’.

In 2017 we also have a better understanding of the limits of national policy-making.  
National decision makers are vital in providing resources, enshrining rights and 
duties, creating incentives and setting the tone.  But laws, guidelines, policies 
and structures do not of themselves change the culture of care.  Sometimes they 
make things worse.  It is committed people that make change.     Through our 
communities of practice, participants increased their knowledge, skills, confidence 
and motivation to make person-centred changes within their spheres of influence. 
It was a privilege to act as a catalyst in this process.  

Wellbeing Our Way has helped us see more clearly our role not only in shaping 
policy but in improving practice.  As we plan the legacy of the programme we 
know it will entail National Voices placing a stronger emphasis on bringing people 
together in a common purpose and on building their capacity to make change.  It 
will mean a growing commitment not only to influence those with formal power, but 
also to be part of a broader movement of health and care professionals, activists 
and citizens.

What is a 
community of 
practice?

Communities of practice facilitate peer-based, collaborative learning between 
people with shared interests. Communities often form around entrenched, complex 
problem-areas for which there are likely to be multiple solutions or approaches – 
the kinds of ‘wicked issues’1 that benefit from being considered from a range of 
critical perspectives and with energy from across the ‘system’.

Crucially, rather than reflecting the ‘top-down’ ethos of more traditional quality 
improvement methodologies, communities of practice offer opportunities for 
self-directed learning. In particular, the ‘social learning’ nature of communities 
of practice ensures that competency is defined and developed collaboratively, 
offering valuable opportunities for new ways of working to be tested and honed, 
and what is understood as ‘good practice’ to be continually pushed to new limits.2 

Communities of practice are an established methodology across diverse 
corporate and governmental sectors. For instance, the US Army has long-standing 
communities of practice working to solve complex technological challenges,3 
and Shell has used communities of practice to facilitate multi-disciplinary learning 
between more than 10,000 of its employees.4

In June 2014, National Voices set out to explore and test how communities of 
practice could facilitate the spread of large-scale change across England’s 
voluntary sector working for health and wellbeing. This publication reflects on our 
experiences over the last 3 years, and in the spirit of communities of practice, aims 
to share reflections in order that others can use our learning.

What makes a community 
of practice?
A community of practice is not just another name for a network or peer group. 
What makes a community of practice distinct is having three clearly defined 
elements: domain, community, and practice. 5

Domain
The domain is the shared focus of the community. This is a defined area in which 
the community has the potential to develop its expertise, to push the boundaries of 
current understanding around ‘good practice’, and – crucially - to which they share 
a level of continuing commitment.

Community
Community of practice members may come from multi-disciplinary backgrounds. 
For instance, Wellbeing Our Way’s communities of practice included people 
working within charities and community organisations, those with experience of 
using health and care services, alongside a smaller number of NHS and social care 
colleagues. What matters is that through regular interaction, the community is able 
to develop strong working relationships based on trust, reciprocal learning, and 
shared accountability. 

Practice
The high level of trust developed within communities of practice enables the 
sharing of tacit knowledge6 (knowledge gained from personal experience; often 
described as knowing ‘how’ rather than ‘what’) around the defined domain of 
interest.

This kind of experiential knowledge often underpins improvement initiatives and 
is the ‘most likely to lead to breakthroughs in thinking and performance’.7 By 
sharing experiences, stories, breakthroughs and challenges, community of practice 
members can shorten their collective learning curve,6 and ultimately develop their 
practice in meaningful and experience-based ways.

Facilitating a community 
of practice

• Agree the ‘domain’ (focus of the community) at the outset 

• Identify your communities – and make it easy and attractive for them to get 
involved

• Build trust so people can share openly

• If place-based, ensure the communities are locally owned

• Offer a range of engagement opportunities – face-to-face, online, ongoing 
and one-off

• Seek to engage people whose roles include strategic and operational 
responsibilities – they are likely to be able to affect the most significant 
change within their organisations

• Plan for the end of formal facilitation – how will community members keep in 
touch?

• Evaluation: identify intended impact, and measure it! Know where your 
evaluative gaps are – what doesn’t the data tell you?

• Share your learning far and wide!

Wellbeing Our 
Way

Wellbeing Our Way was born from the belief that voluntary and community sector 
organisations, alongside people with long-term health needs, can play a powerful 
role in creating a health and care ‘system’ which works for everyone: a system 
which values people’s strengths, is based in their communities, and enables people 
to make decisions based on their personal preferences and priorities.

Wellbeing Our Way has been using a communities of practice approach to 
facilitate learning around a set of collaboratively agreed priorities:

• Peer support

• Supporting self-management

• Care and support planning

• Person-centred information and helplines

• Engaging people in shaping health and care

• Demonstrating the impact of these interventions

We’re proud of what Wellbeing Our Way has achieved. Our impact report shows 
that:

• 79% of those involved report that Wellbeing Our Way has enabled them to 
increase their knowledge, skills, confidence and motivation

• 75% of community of practice members have been enabled to create 
change in their organisations

National 
communities of 
practice

Overview
Wellbeing Our Way’s national communities of practice brought together people 
from charities and community organisations, alongside those with direct 
experience of using health and care services, to share learning and challenge 
around a range of person- and community-centred approaches.

Each community aimed to:

1. Enable people within the community to increase their knowledge, skills, 
confidence, and motivation in order to develop their own practice.

2. Make a contribution to the wider voluntary sector by sharing knowledge and 
expertise.

To facilitate in-depth discussion and focused learning, Wellbeing Our Way’s 
community of practice meetings usually followed a similar agenda. Meetings 
began with community members providing updates on successes, challenges or 
learning since the last meeting and raising any issues they’d like to discuss as a 
community. 

We usually then had a presentation – either from a community of practice member 
or external contributor – which prompted more detailed consideration of a 
particular ‘wicked issue’ or approach, for instance social return on investment or 
help for those providing peer support. 



14

People with lived experience often co-presented, adding to the diversity of 
perspectives considered. Challenges and interests raised were used as the basis of 
a forward plan for upcoming meetings.

Wellbeing Our Way’s communities of practice have now come to an end in line 
with programme funding. Relationships developed through the communities will be 
continued using groups.io8 and through National Voices’ ongoing work in relation 
to peer support, supported self-management and care and support planning.

8groups.io is an online community platform.

“Wellbeing Our Way has exposed me to a ‘tide of movement’ around asset-
based approaches to wellbeing. This has coincided with my organisation 
exploring how to embed supported self-management principles and a co-
productive ethos across our work. 

Support from Wellbeing Our Way – in particular learning from people with 
lived experience about the impact of peer support on their own lives and 
others with expertise in developing these approaches – has enabled me 
to contribute to significant cultural change in my organisation around how 
we work with and support people living with the long term condition we 
represent.

We now have a range of peer support services and are actively developing 
our support for people (including carers) to self-manage, making support 
more holistic and rooting it in peer support principles.”

“Contributing to Wellbeing Our Way has given me opportunities to share 
my expertise (particularly around diversity and working with ‘less heard’ 
communities) and to take learning back to my own communities.

Learning from the community of practice has influenced how I work within 
my community – I’m more aware of the contributions and needs of carers 
and wider family – and the organisation I’m involved with has started to 
consider broader outcomes for the people we work with.

It has also helped me develop my confidence personally; I’m more able to 
speak up publicly.”

“Before becoming part of Wellbeing Our Way, I had a theoretical 
understanding of self-management principles but no ‘real life’ examples of 
what did or did not work in practice.”

Communities of practice 
in the voluntary sector: 
What we’ve learned
Co-design is time well spent
During Wellbeing Our Way’s first 6 months, around 40 organisations contributed to 
the development of a model of impact which formed the basis of developing the 
programme’s strategic priorities, its theory of change, and its evaluation framework. 

We knew that ensuring Wellbeing Our Way’s development was rooted in the 
strengths and aspirations of its communities would help to generate the sustained 
energy needed for impactful communities of practice; this initial period of testing 
ideas also led to the priorities being honed. Involving a range of organisations at 
this stage was an important way of seeding Wellbeing Our Way’s networks and 
connecting people in the very early stages of the activity.

Conversely, where we’ve taken people’s ideas and delivered a final product without 
this level of co-design, initiatives have been less successful. An example of this is 
our Timebank (a way of exchanging skills and resources where the ‘currency’ is a 
person’s time, rather than money or credit).9 

Despite initial enthusiasm, Wellbeing Our Way’s Timebank hasn’t taken off - scope 
for co-design was limited as we were using existing forums on National Voices’ 
website. This could perhaps have been overcome in part by ensuring a greater 
range of offers were uploaded before the resource going live, to ensure greater 
community energy from the outset. 

Co-design often brings sustainable energy for the initiative or changes – it may not 
always be possible to fully co-design every aspect, but our experience shows that 
it’s worth carefully approaching how to generate this energy in other ways.

The most successful communities 
pushed the boundaries of existing 
knowledge and expertise
Wellbeing Our Way’s two most energetic and committed communities of practice 
have focused on supporting self-management and peer support. 

Both of these priorities are ‘mainstream’ enough for large-scale buy in, but still 
under-developed enough to allow significant scope for development – therefore, 
these communities of practice were working at the very edge of existing knowledge 
and practice. They have also been the priorities which appear to fit most closely 
with strategic direction both in terms of individual community of practice member 
organisations and the wider health and care voluntary sector. 

In these communities, we achieved a strong balance between ‘core business’ and 
developing practice.10 The communities enabled significant learning in the specific 
domains (peer support and supporting self-management) while simultaneously 
linking with strategic developments across other parts of the system - in this case, 
community of practice member organisations and the wider voluntary sector.

“Understanding a range of organisational approaches to supporting self-
management helped me to ‘benchmark’ and develop a more thorough 
understanding of good practice. This in turn helped me influence our 
organisational understanding and approach. “

How change happens
When people are engaged in defining and creating change themselves (rather 
than experiencing ‘top-down’ initiatives), they are nearly five times more committed 
to the outcome.11 This is fundamental to a communities of practice approach 
which at its heart facilitates social learning and therefore self-directed change. 

We’ve noticed that a few factors have underpinned how successful community of 
practice members have been in galvanising change in their organisations:

1. Some of the greatest success has been seen where an 
individual has joined the community with a clearly defined 
goal in mind. 

For instance, developing a peer support offer for young people, 
strengthening their approach to impact measurement, or trialling a whole 
new way of working within their organisation. All of these are real examples 
of goals which have been set and achieved by community of practice 
members – see our impact report for further detail.

2. Community of practice members need ‘permission’ to try 
something new from decision-makers in their organisation. 

This hasn’t always meant top-level senior leadership. Stronger indicators of 
success are a team or organisation-wide commitment to trialling different 
approaches; and individual members being given ‘space’ to think through 
how they can approach their work differently and share their learning with 
their team. 

Barriers to members being able to initiate change in their organisations have 
included an ideological mismatch between individuals and their organisations - 
most commonly in the balance between clinical and wider community support 
– resulting in people not being able to secure the time to commit to community of 
practice meetings, or to trial new ideas within their everyday roles.

These factors are more to do with the individual and the receptiveness of their 
organisation than how the communities of practice are facilitated per se. They 
might form useful discussion topics within community of practice meetings – for 
instance, support to develop goals or to learn influencing techniques to secure 
strategic ‘buy in’ for intended changes.

Great facilitation enables creative 
thinking and increased confidence
We have paid close attention to the facilitation of Wellbeing Our Way’s community 
of practice meetings and wider events.

Events have long been known as a way to build community identity.10 We have 
certainly found this to be the case within Wellbeing Our Way.  Through a range 
of shared learning workshops, masterclasses, roundtable discussions, and more 
traditional meetings, we have engaged more than 200 organisations. These 
ranged from large ‘household name’ charities through to volunteer-led community 
organisations, demonstrating that a space to learn, reflect, and meet others with 
complementary aspirations is valued throughout diverse stakeholder groups.

Discussions at the events have been instrumental in informing the work of the 
communities of practice. We have used a range of facilitation techniques taken 
from design thinking,12 appreciative enquiry,13 and asset-based approaches14 to 
enable people to think creatively and express their experiences honestly. Identified 
challenges and aspirations have formed the basis of community of practice 
discussions and efforts.

For further detail around the range of facilitation techniques used, see the 
Facilitation page on our website.

12Design thinking is a method for practical, creative resolution of problems. It is a form of solution-
based thinking with the intent of producing a constructive future result. We have utilised design 
tools such as personas and user journey mapping to develop insight into problems and 
generate new solutions
13Appreciative enquiry is a model which seeks to engage people in self-directed change. 
We have used it both as an underpinning ethos, and as a source of practical activities – for 
instance SOAR (an alternative to traditional SWOT analysis). 
14Asset-based approaches (for instance, asset based community development, health 
coaching or social movements for public health) start from a central enquiry into ‘what makes 
and keeps us healthy?’ rather than ‘how can we tackle illness?’

“I think that Wellbeing Our Way’s major strength is allowing these 
communities of practice to shape the direction of the discussions they have, 
while still being able to provide external input.”

It takes both ‘+’ and ‘-‘ to create real 
energy11

Creating a compelling narrative for change needs a careful and simultaneous 
interplay between ‘solving the problem’ and ‘capturing the opportunity’ – straying 
too far towards problem-solving invites despondency and fatigue (as barriers 
can seem overwhelming), whereas purely ‘can do’ approaches can lack full 
consideration of risks and challenges.11

‘Quick wins’ generate initial and ongoing energy… 

We have facilitated the development and sharing of ‘quick wins’ in a few ways:

• Asking people to identify and commit to changing one tangible aspect of 
their practice in response to what they’ve learned – and providing pledge 
cards for people to record their goals.

• Creating regular space in which people can share their successes – leading 
to communal celebration and a ‘can do’ culture within the communities of 
practice.

…and can be balanced by intentional sharing of challenges

We have utilised a strict Chatham House rule,17 within a broader culture of 
reciprocal trust, to enable people to openly share challenges and failures. 
Sharing what hasn’t worked – alongside what has – contributes to shortening the 
community’s learning curve and prevents the duplication of mistakes.

Demonstrate the depth of existing 
social capital and recognise and 
address gaps in knowledge10

Identifying specific expertise within the communities of practice has not only led to 
inspirational learning around diverse aspects of practice, it has also:

• generated energy and interest to prevent the communities from becoming 
stagnant

• demonstrated the legitimacy of knowledge/experience leading to deeper 
levels of reciprocal trust between members

• underpinned the ways in which real challenges can be collaboratively 
addressed,10 and

• enabled us to identify gaps in knowledge and invite guest contributors as 
appropriate – these have included Wellmind Media (digital support for self-
management), Institute of Mental Health (peer support training) and Bright 
Ideas Consulting (theory of change and impact evaluation).



22

Defining the scope of the ‘domain’ is 
essential (and challenging!)
Wellbeing Our Way utilised a ‘funnel’ approach to programme planning – starting 
with a disparate set of aspirations and perspectives before using an iterative 
honing process to identify a set of clearly defined priorities.

In the main this approach worked well: it was collaborative and generated energy 
across broad networks. However, for one of our priorities – engaging people in 
shaping health and care support – an agreed definition remained elusive. 

There may be several reasons for this:

• National Voices’ members, and the wider voluntary sector, engage people 
in such a range of activities – research, codesign, acting as ambassadors, 
campaigning for change, raising funds – that a specific single common 
interest was extremely challenging to establish.

• This led to the aims of the community not being well enough defined to 
underpin meaningful collaborative learning and constructive. challenge (in 
part as the necessary trust didn’t develop sufficiently)

• Feedback suggests that people either thought ‘we’re already doing that’ 
or weren’t entirely sure where to start – both mindsets were a barrier to 
engagement.

More broadly, each community of practice grappled with issues around ambition 
and realism in terms of the community’s aspirations16 - for instance, were we 
aspiring to ‘future-proof’ services or create incremental change? What’s the most 
appropriate balance between the two?

Views around this issue were sometimes contentious and differed between the 
communities in terms of fluctuating confidence (often in line with the ‘four stages 
of competence’17 of learning), and how well established these approaches were 
understood both at individual and organisational levels.

Involving senior leaders – to ‘make 
space’ for change 
Despite Wellbeing Our Way’s primary audience being people either directly working 
in ‘front line’ roles, or those with responsibilities for designing and developing front 
line interventions, it became apparent that we needed to ensure ‘buy in’ from 
senior leaders. This was to enable change efforts to have greater connectedness 
with the wider organisation’s strategic direction, and mitigated against them 
operating ‘under the radar’, which risks sustainability and credibility.

We created bespoke offers to engage senior leaders, both of which successfully 
extended our engagement with this cohort18:

• Our breakfast roundtable was an opportunity for senior leaders to discuss 
the voluntary sector’s role in care and support planning (in response to our 
recent publication of a discussion paper on the same theme). The breakfast 
was hosted by Jeremy Taylor (National Voices’ chief executive) and included 
Alf Collins (highly respected clinician, commissioner and person-centred 
care advisor). 

• We developed a series of masterclasses – systems leadership (hosted by 
Debbie Sorkin, National Director of Systems Leadership at The Leadership 
Centre); coproduction (with the Coalition for Collaborative Care); and 
facilitation. 

These events became an important aspect of extending Wellbeing Our Way’s 
offer and ensuring that senior leadership were aware of Wellbeing Our Way - 
encouraging them to ‘make space’ for change in their organisations, for instance 
by allowing colleagues time to attend community of practice meetings and to trial 
implementation of new ideas.

The extent to which senior leadership ‘buy in’ is required is an aspect worth 
exploring when taking a communities of practice approach. We considered senior-
level involvement a ‘nice to have’ but not necessarily a critical success factor for 
Wellbeing Our Way. As a result, we made limited efforts, with limited success, to 
engage this cohort, instead prioritising other programme activities within inevitable 
time and budget constraints. 

In hindsight, it might have been valuable to invest further into engaging this 
group to ensure that community of practice members felt empowered by their 
senior leadership to design and execute change initiatives. This balance might be 
different in other contexts, and isn’t one which is easy to ascertain, but is likely to be 
worth giving due consideration.

18We define ‘senior leaders’ as being those working at chief executive or director level.

24

Communities of practice may have a 
natural time limit
We’ve found that membership of the communities has ebbed and flowed – at 
times being strong and purposeful, and at others trickling down to a very small 
core group. 

In hindsight, it would have been beneficial to plan for this more proactively, 
ensuring a range of offers to facilitate what Wenger describes as the ‘rich fabric of 
connectivity’10 which holds communities together.

The WOW! Exchange has proven to be an important way of people exchanging 
ideas and learning from others – around 500 individual users access the Exchange 
each month, with slightly fewer than 14,000 ‘hits’ in total. This online space will form 
part of Wellbeing Our Way’s legacy.

Another aspect of this may have been to focus our energies on fewer communities 
of practice, allowing them to work with each other more intensively. We made 
considerable efforts to galvanise the ‘engaging people’ community, which failed 
to really take off – the balance between investing sufficient effort to ensure success 
and making the decision to invest the energy elsewhere remains challenging, even 
with the benefit of hindsight.

Evaluation 
To the best of our knowledge, Wellbeing Our Way represents the most significant 
recent attempt to use a communities of practice approach to facilitate social 
learning across England’s health and care voluntary and community sector.

In this context, robust evaluation has been significant in two main ways:

• to explore the extent, and ways in which, this approach may be helpful at 
enabling change at scale, and

• to generate evidence of success, in order to galvanise interest and 
momentum.

Wellbeing Our Way’s evaluation framework was underpinned by its theory of 
change and included key aspects such as diversity of participants and events 
feedback, alongside the fundamental questions of: 

• the extent to which participants had increased their knowledge, skills, 
confidence and motivation; and 

• the extent to which community of practice members were able to develop 
their organisation’s practice in a particular approach (e.g. peer support, 
information and helplines, care and support planning etc)

Full details are included in our impact report.

https://www.nationalvoices.org.uk/node/1573


26

What our evaluation didn’t tell us
There are other significant aspects which might have been interesting to explore, 
but which lay outside the scope of our evaluation framework. These include:

1. Connectedness between members.16 

Anecdotally, we know that Wellbeing Our Way’s networks extended beyond 
direct community of practice membership, for instance across people 
who attended events; contributed to or used the WOW! Exchange; shared 
perspectives through our blogspot or newsletter; or were directly introduced 
to each other by a community of practice member. 

However, we have been unable to track the development of new networks 
through Wellbeing Our Way, primarily due to the need to prioritise and 
manage the burden of evaluation. The Health Foundation has done some 
interesting work around measuring how its Q initiative has enabled members 
to generate wider networks, with impressive results.19

2. People’s experience of attempting to create change back in 
their organisations.16 

In the cases in which people tried to implement change, but were 
unsuccessful, we collected initial qualitative data around their experiences, 
which were used to inform the development of the communities of practice. 
However, this would be an interesting aspect to explore in more detail to 
understand better the barriers and enablers for change in this context, and 
the consequences of iterative development in response to initial findings.

3. Connectedness between organisational culture/strategies 
and the change created.

It would have been interesting to explore the extent to which developments 
made were embedded within existing services and/or organisational culture, 
or whether they were made ‘under the radar’ with a view to understanding 
whether this made a difference in terms of depth and sustainability.

Case study
How communities of practice can 
enable change
Lymphoma Association joined Wellbeing Our Way’s supporting self-management 
community of practice about two years ago, around the same time as they 
were starting to develop their ‘live your life – living with and beyond lymphoma’ 
programme. 

Here’s how they summarise the community’s contribution to ‘live your life’, which is 
now a Big Lottery Funded programme:

“Being able to share with and learn from others who were going through 
similar developments at different stages was really useful. We could 
contribute insight to each other’s challenges whether it was around 
approaches to learning, securing funding or programme outcomes. 

It helped to learn from good practice, validate thinking and development 
around our programme as well as finesse the direction of travel. It was really 
helpful to put the development of our programme in perspective and to 
sanity check expectations amongst people who had already done it.

It was particularly useful to hear from people representing different condition 
areas and not necessarily cancer. Measuring impact and monitoring was 
a new skills and experience area for me personally and the community of 
practice really helped to crystallise my understanding around this. It was 
also useful to get contacts and recommendations from the participants of 
the community to follow up.”

For more examples of how Wellbeing Our Way’s national communities of practice 
have enabled people to create change in their organisations, see Wellbeing Our 
Way’s impact report.

Place-based 
communities of 
practice

Overview
Since October 2016, Wellbeing Our Way has facilitated two place-based 
communities of practice across Greater Manchester, focusing on peer support and 
supported self-management.

This approach has been based in our experience of facilitating national 
communities of practice, with some important distinctions:

1. The communities are ‘place based’.

This means that their focus is on developing practice and relationships 
across Greater Manchester, identifying and building on regional strengths 
and opportunities. 

2. The communities are voluntary and community sector-led 
while including colleagues from statutory health and care 
services, alongside people living with long-term health 
conditions or caring responsibilities. 

This extended membership reflects the partnership opportunities offered by 
health and social care devolution, as detailed by the region’s Memorandum 
of Understanding,20 alongside a genuine commitment to developing 
partnership working as a basis for developing coordinated, preventative 
approaches to health and wellbeing across the region.

29

What did we learn? 
The success of these communities 
depended on them being locally 
owned and led
Although perhaps an obvious point, we found that the reality of ensuring that 
we combined Wellbeing Our Way’s expertise in developing and facilitating 
communities of practice alongside local expertise and ownership was complex 
and required ongoing attention. 

Several factors underpinned successful partnership working between National 
Voices and our partners across Greater Manchester:

1. We worked in partnership with the 10GM21 chief officers and 
other key regional stakeholders.

This collaboration took place throughout the scoping, design and delivery 
of the communities of practice, ensuring that their development was 
rooted in detailed understanding of regional context, opportunities and 
challenges. This included negotiation around the fundamental design of the 
communities; for instance, their scope (membership and domain), language 
used and help to engage with a diversity of people and organisations.

2. Wellbeing Our Way’s regional coordinator, Emma Baylin, was 
based in Macc (Manchester’s VCSE support organisation) 
on behalf of 10GM.

This enabled Emma to take a partnership building approach rooted within 
existing relationships and to extend these connections more broadly across 
the region. We’re hopeful that these broader connections will form a lasting 
aspect of Wellbeing Our Way’s legacy across Greater Manchester.

2110 GM is a joint venture to support the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector in the 
ten boroughs of Greater Manchester.

30

We also faced some ongoing challenges:

1. Terminology used locally isn’t always the same as that used 
nationally.

Despite giving significant thought to the language used to describe the 
community of practice domains, we found that these didn’t resonate 
as strongly with community organisations as they did with national 
organisations working across the region. ‘Self care’ is more widely recognised 
than ‘self-management’ across Greater Manchester – broadening our 
terminology might have helped to build shared understanding and 
increased community of practice membership.

2. We noticed a reduction in ‘middle management’ levels 
within organisations.

This was problematic for Wellbeing Our Way as we have achieved some of 
our most impressive impact when working with people who span strategic 
and operational roles (because of their ability to affect integrated change 
across strategic and ‘front line’ aspects of their organisation’s work). We also 
noticed a significant reduction in people’s ability to commit to community 
of practice meetings – the masterclasses and ‘one off’ events were better 
attended than the regular meetings.

Greater Manchester’s most recent ‘State of the Sector’ report22 demonstrates 
that small organisations are seeing a reduction in their funding, whereas 
larger organisations are more likely to be securing increased levels of 
funding.

31

Partnerships which span national and 
regional interests bring unique value
One of Wellbeing Our Way’s contributions which people reported finding useful was 
to create space to explore the interplay between national and regional policy and 
practice initiatives.

Contributions included:

• Mike Wild (chief executive of Macc) leading a discussion around devolution 
in Greater Manchester and engagement with voluntary and community 
organisations.

• Debbie Sorkin (National Director of Systems Leadership at The Leadership 
Centre) hosting a systems leadership masterclass for those involved in 
Wellbeing Our Way and the South Manchester systems leadership initiative. 

• We also shared learning from national programmes – such as Realising the 
Value – and facilitated discussions around how the learning could be useful 
to local implementation.

“It felt good to be part of something that linked regional and national. It 
broadened the shoulders of an ordinary citizen of Manchester – it was a 
lovely feeling.”

Reflections from those 
involved

Hameed Khan
Hameed Khan is a carer and local activist with specific 
interests in mental health, BME, and LGBT issues. He 
has been involved in Wellbeing Our Way in Greater 
Manchester from the outset, contributing to its design 
and ongoing development. 

Wellbeing Our Way has created new connections

“Wellbeing Our Way has facilitated connections between organisations 
which didn’t already know of each other, but whose work is complementary. 
For instance, I’ve met people from organisations working across health, 
education, housing, domestic violence and from across Greater 
Manchester’s 10 boroughs. This provides valuable opportunities to explore 
wider aspects of wellbeing, even if an individual’s core interests lie in one 
aspect of health, for instance mental health.”

Coproduction has been a real strength of Wellbeing Our 
Way

“As a community activist, Wellbeing Our Way gave me access to decision 
makers. It also helped me realise what structures I need to be involved with 
to help to continue to influence change. I’ve developed advocacy skills, 
not through a direct training session on advocacy, but through the style of 
working and learning.”

Hameed reflected that our reward and recognition policy enabled him to 
participate – the straightforward process and prompt reimbursement was helpful, 
and the inclusion of carers’ fees ensured that Hameed had peace of mind while 
contributing to Wellbeing Our Way’s activities. Please feel free to use or adapt this 
policy for your own work.

Antonia Pike
Antonia Pike is an Involvement Coordinator at Making 
Space, a national charity and leading provider of adult 
health and social care services. 

“Making Space is in the early stages of developing a peer support training 
programme for people who are supported through its services so that 
they’re able to facilitate peer support groups and to work alongside people 
who have similar experiences to them.

Wellbeing Our Way has been helpful in the following ways:

• By highlighting the importance of peer support and the benefits for the 
people taking part, it has reiterated the significance of this approach and 
reassured us that we are investing our efforts wisely.

• I’ve learned from the WOW! Exchange – particularly from the experiences 
of Community Catalysts (a social enterprise which helps local people 
deliver health and care support and services for other local people) 
and Turning Point (which runs a peer mentoring programme where 
role models use their own experiences to support and inspire others to 
become substance free).

• The community of practice group discussions have been useful in terms 
of making links with other organisations in the region.

• We’re also exploring how to build a coproductive ethos into our work to 
help improve people’s wellbeing – the coproduction masterclass helped 
me think through how to begin raising awareness within my organisation.

Molly Bishop
Molly Bishop is Charity Support and Development Officer 
at H3, a charity that supports people experiencing 
homelessness, and those at risk of homelessness, through 
a range of inclusive support activities across Stockport.

Since being involved in Wellbeing Our Way, Molly has helped set up a community 
of practice exploring links between homelessness and clinical pathways as part of 
a broader Homelessness and Inclusion Health initiative.

Molly reflected that Wellbeing Our Way has given her the confidence to support 
the development of this new community of practice – through demonstrating the 
value of exploring partnerships and starting from a point of shared curiosity around 
how things could be approached differently, rather than needing to have definitive 
answers.
