Hot Topic: Effective Networks

This hot topic outlines what the evidence says about leading and participating in effective 
networks in health and care environments. It will look at what is meant by a network and 
the difference between networks and communities of practice; what should be considered 
when starting a new network (and how to make it a successful one) and the potential pitfalls 
to avoid. It will also cover network leadership and explore the role technology plays in 
supporting networks to work across boundaries and organisations.

‘Networks play many roles in healthcare. Some drive change across organisations others 
simply unite individuals with common interests. Networks are growing in number and 
importance in UK healthcare. They are ideally placed to tackle systematic and complex 

problems faced by commissioners, providers and regulators, as well as frontline staff and 
service users. Research has suggested they contribute to healthcare improvement by providing 
a forum for experimentation and creating knowledge, exchanging information and spreading 

good practice.’ (Health Foundation, 2014: p. 5)

Networks and Communities of Practice 
(CoPs) – what’s the difference?

In its most basic form ‘a network is an 
interconnected group or system’ (Health 
Foundation, 2014: 7). Networks have an 
element of spontaneity in the way they are 
established and their tendency to evolve, 
crucially they ‘are distinct from hierarchies, 
which are controlled via commands, and 
from markets, where control is financial’ 
(Health Foundation, 2014: 7). They ‘transcend 
strategic management’ and are inherently 
inter-disciplinary (Malby & Mervyn, 2012a: 
3). The literature reinforces that it is not 
the ‘mechanisms that support a network’ 
i.e. mailing lists and online platforms, that 
define a network, but rather ‘the people and 
the relationships between them’ that are 
paramount (Hearn & Mendizabal, 2011: 2). 
Networks are not static, they ‘continuously 
grow and develop, as more people join, 
cultivate relationships and exchange 
information’ and connect people to each 
other, to knowledge and build knowledge 
bases (NHS Scotland, n.d. b; NHS Digital, n.d.).

So in summary, networks:

•    Champion interconnectivity
•    Have elements of spontaneity
•    Evolve over time
•    Enable the sharing of knowledge and
      expertise
•    Are inherently inter-disciplinary
•    Are people-centric

Often the word network and term 
Community of Practice (CoP) are used 
interchangeably, but there are subtle 
differences identified in the literature. 
Though there is some overlap in what has 
been identified as ways to create effective 
networks and CoPs, it is helpful to understand 
what sets them apart from each other. One 
major difference seems to be structure. CoPs 
are ‘structured systems’ (NHS Scotland, n.d. b), 
unlike networks that can be more informal, 
though of course some networks have an 
element of structure. Secondly CoPs share 
a ‘specific interest that becomes a source of 
identification’ which fundamentally brings 
its members together (NHS Scotland, n.d. a). 
The difference has been neatly summarised 
by the team at Wenger-Trayner (leading 
experts and researchers in thought leadership, 
communities of practice and systems 
thinking):

‘All communities of practice are networks 
in the sense that they involve connections 
among members. But not all networks are 
communities of practice: a community of 
practice entails shared domain that becomes 
a source of identification. This identity creates 
a sense of commitment to the community as 
a whole, not just connections to a few linking 
nodes.’ (TeamBE, 2011)

The distinctive features of a Community of 
Practice can be described as:

•    Domain – shared focus of the community
•    Community – CoP members may come
      from multi-disciplinary backgrounds
•    Practice – enabling the sharing of tacit 
      knowledge (National Voices, 2017: 6)

Types of Network

The NHS Context

A number of different networks are described in the literature. Randall (2013: 9) identifies the 
following network types:

•    Managed (top-down)
•    Hybrid clinical (explicit clinical outcome focus)
•    Developmental (peer-to-peer formal)
•    Agency (pooling of resources)
•    Learning (communities of practice)
•    Learning (enclave/ support)
•    Advocacy (champion and role model)
•    Social movement (peer-to-peer)

There is an emphasis on the diversity of network types in the NHS with most falling into one 
of four categories in the network lifecycle:

Diagram Adapted from Randall (2013: 9)

Malby & Mervyn (2012a: 3) concluded that networks are ‘relatively poorly understood in the 
NHS’ and that they would ‘benefit from understanding the range of network types and how 
to design their network structure and architecture to enable successful starting conditions.’ 
Research shows there is a mixture of networks in the NHS, both in terms of scale, governance, 
structure and formality; generally larger networks are more formalised, but smaller networks 
encounter less challenges (Ferlie, Fitzgerald & Addicott, 2010). Most recently the Health 
Foundation (2014) commissioned a piece of research to get a clearer picture of the impact 
networks have on quality improvement (QI) in the NHS – it confirmed networks are in  a 
unique position to support QI within the health and care system.

What is the role of a network? Setting up a network

Hearn and Mendizbal (2011: 4) outlined five 
key roles and functions for any network:

1.    Knowledge Management – the ability of 
the network to acquire, filter, exchange and 
disseminate knowledge

2.    Amplification and advocacy – functions 
that help networks place issues on the global 
agenda

3.    Community building – enables networks 
to build shared visions among diverse 
stakeholders

4.     Convening – providing bridges between 
groups who  would not normally meet

5.    Mobilise resources – provide efficient 
channels for aggregated funding and services 
to enhance the work of members

Networks are about people and therefore 
cannot be created in the same way as projects 
or organisations - instead they are about 
identifying, enhancing and adding value to 
existing relationships (Hearn & Mendizabal, 
2011). 

Considerations of network planning:

1.    Members – there are different depths of 
membership e.g. leaders, active members or 
those associated with the network who are 
less active, but still contribute

2.    Governance – cannot be the same as 
hierarchical organisations, one rule unlikely to 
fit all. About transforming informal rules and 
relationships into formal ones

3.    Organisational arrangements – organic, 
evolve and emerge and grow to meet 
challenges

4.    Stewardship – some form of leadership 
is essential to connect members, ideas and 
activities in a sustainable way

5.    Resources – intensive, to maintain 
relationships requires times and effort. 
Networks demand attention

6.    Research – look at networks that already 
exist, build on them and make strategic use of 
resources before setting up a new network  
(Hearn & Mendizabal, 2011: 2, 7)

Recap: key things to remember

Some practical steps for setting up a network, taken from the Health Foundation 
(2014: 16-21):

•    Understanding the structure and characteristics of professional networks is vital
•    It is important to attend to how a network functions
•    It may be time well spent, depending on local conditions, to nurture professional 
      networks and invest time to facilitate their contributions to care 
      (Cunningham et al., 2011: 248)

What makes an effective network?

Ultimately effective networks contain people who ‘provide opportunities; celebrate successes; 
are “hubs” for other networks and groups and influence agendas’ (Bristol University, n.d.).

1.    Common Purpose (draws members 
together)

2.    Cooperative structure (enables people to 
work together across organisations)

3.    Critical mass (expands and increases value 
for members)

4.    Collective intelligence (accumulation of 
sharing and learning)

5.     Community building (members benefit 
from each other and the relationships they 
foster)

You can watch a video expanding on the 
principles of the 5C Wheel here

The literature identifies a number of key ways a network can be more effective, namely ‘the 
presence of a shared ideology’ for members to work towards and the importance of effective 
leadership and fostering clinical/ managerial hybrid roles to ‘win legitimacy’ (Ferlie, Fitzgerald 
& Addicott, 2010: 144, 156). Having these ‘key players, often in management or leadership 
roles’ who can ‘act as connectors to transmit information’ helps build bridges and enable the 
sharing of information between the network and other groups (Cunningham et al., 2011: 
247). Good communication is encouraged in effective networks and the presence of trust is 
crucial (Cunningham et al., 2011). An effective social network is concerned with ‘constructing 
and using social capital’ through information sharing – if learning is valued social networks 
are more impactful (Malby & Mervyn, 2012b: 7).

The Health Foundation’s (2014) review found that though there is no ‘one size fits all’ 
formula for designing successful networks, there are five core features (illustrated by the 5C 
Wheel) that enable quality improvement:

Network Leadership Why do some networks fail?

Leading a network is different than 
leadership in traditional hierarchies (Malby & 
Mervyn, 2012a). Network leadership should 
be ‘facilitative, distributed and inclusive, 
whilst making the most of different creative 
ends’ and have a firm focus on members 
and impact (Malby & Mervyn, 2012a: 4). A 
shift from bureaucratic line management 
styles to a broader definition and ‘flexible 
cross boundary working’ is expected (Ferlie, 
Fitzgerald & Addicott, 2010: 157). The move 
to more ‘lateral patterns of leadership’ 
requires a combination of soft and hard 
management skills and a greater need for 
administrative resources (Ferlie, Fitzgerald & 
Addicott, 2010: 157). 

There are number of reasons why a network 
has the potential to fail - mitigating some 
of these risks might mean a network is more 
effective. Malby & Mervyn (2012a) warn of 
about the following; institutionalism, over-
management, mistakes made in design, 
over-expectation of members, constraining 
the independence of network members, 
or a failure to recognise when a change in 
leadership might be necessary. Equally over-
reliance on individuals or ‘key players’ can 
also ‘be a vulnerability’ if leaders ‘leave, 
change roles or become marginalised’ 
(Cunningham et al., 2011: 247). There is also 
evidence to suggest that poorly resourced 
networks lack the potential to move forward 
and that networks with a greater number 
of stakeholders, with more variety, can 
encounter more difficulties 
(Cunnigham et al., 2011).

Wenger-Trayner (n.d.) identify the following 
network ‘Failure Factors’:
•    Lack of time
•    Leader neglect
•    Focus on events
•    Focus on documents
•    De-energising tasks and red tape
•    Logistics or IT
•    Command/ control
•    A cookie-cutter approach (repetition in 
approach and lack of individuality) 
•    Ideology 

Some networks can be categorised 
as ‘dormant’ in that they were once 
‘established’, might still have some members 
and a vague infrastructure but have ‘ceased 
to fulfil the intended function’ (Randall, 
2013: 5). In this case the network has not 
failed as such but may need attention, 
transformation or the instigation of a close-
down process. Networks are ‘indigenous 
to any situation or environment’ and ‘exist 
before an initiative comes along and will exist 
after it has closed down’ providing they are 
nurtured, maintained and supported (Hearn & 
Mendizabal, 2011: 7).

The role of technology in effective 
networks

There are a few things to remember 
when considering the use of technology 
to share information and updates within 
a network. Information technologies and 
online platforms can of course be incredibly 
useful in enhancing the communication 
capabilities of a network, but they cannot 
make for a successful network in and of 
themselves – an ‘investment in technology 
offers no guarantees for gathering collective 
intelligence’ (Health Foundation, 2014: 19).

The Health Foundation (2014) recommend 
that any technology selected should provide 
the infrastructure needed to share data and 
experience; be ‘easy and convenient for all 
to use’; and ‘offer sufficient incentive to 
make people want to use’ it - in other words 
include useful and high quality content that is 
regularly updated and create an environment 
members want to utilise and engage with 
(Health Foundation, 2014: 19). Wenger and 
Trayner (n.d.) go as far as to say systems can 
‘break’ a community if they are difficult to 
use, as members become frustrated and give 
up attempting to interact with them.

Interestingly in Ferlie, Fitzgerald & Addicott’s 
study (2010: 19, 149) ICTs did not ‘emerge 
as an important part’ of the stories of the 
networks they studied, basic IT was necessary 
to store and share data, as well as the 
expertise of key network staff, but they found 
‘little support for the argument that new ICTs 
are a major driver towards network forms’. 
In other words, networks need somewhere 
to store and share information, but exactly 
which technological product they used was 
not what was important, rather that the tool 
selected met the network’s needs. In reality 
most key decision making took place ‘face 
to face rather than electronically’ (Ferlie, 
Fitzgerald & Addicott, 2010: 149). This was 
echoed by Hanewald (2013) who found the 
‘mere offer of technology’ did not ensure a 
positive learning experience in her research 
into two educational networks, the more 
successful of the networks she investigated 
placed greater emphasis on face-to-face 
learning (Hanewald, 2013). 

To summarise, technologies selected to 
support a network should prioritise usability 
and consider the skills of network members, 
and resources available to them. Online 
systems and spaces are no substitute for 
face-to-face interaction and should be used 
to complement, rather than replace, these 
interactions. See Appendix 1 one for more 
information on some online platforms used to 
network in health and care.

Recommendations

Hanewald (2013) provides some useful suggestions to help with selecting the appropriate 
technology:

•    Choose something based on user needs which aligns with their digital literacy levels
•    Pick something that is intuitive, user-friendly and does not require a lot of set-up
•    Check compatibility with other online tools
•    Ensure multimodality (can you share text, images video and audio files?)
•    Does it have the ability to schedule posts and also hold chats?

Behavioural recommendations are also 
important and can include: naming at least 
one site administrator; clearly articulating 
the rationale and benefits of engaging; 
communicating the ethics of online conduct; 
encouraging collegiate relationships, 
establishing a code of conduct and 
documenting any lessons learned (Hanewald, 
2013).

Other considerations

Appendix

Next Steps

•    Potential firewall issues - some platforms 
may be blocked by local IT services so assess 
this during selection (can IT unblock the site 
or might a backup be needed?)

•    Check usability on different browsers and 
devices  - remember not everyone has access 
to the same software or accesses information 
in the same way

•    Is the system/ site optimised for 
smartphones and tablets?

•    Security - depending the data/ 
information being stored consider the 
reputation of the site/ system (is it NHS or 
public sector endorsed for example? Are there 
any governance issues i.e. where will the data 
be stored? If data is stored outside the EEA 
will there be implications?) 

•    What permission levels are available for 
groups/ networks on the site or system?

•    Are there any costs associated with the 
site or system chosen?

For more information on some potential sites 
or systems for sharing information online see 
Appendix 1 (Online Platforms for networks & 
Communities of Practice). This is by no means 
an exhaustive list but is a helpful staring 
point. 

Networks are ‘ideally placed to tackle 
systematic and complex problems faced by 
commissioners, providers and regulators, as 
well as frontline staff and service users’ and 
therefore have an important and crucial role 
in the health and care landscape (Health 
Foundation, 2014: 5). 

Next steps vary depending on the stages of 
the network. Researching before creation of 
new networks avoids duplication of effort. 
Established networks should evaluate their 
progress, think about refreshing processes 
and consider if learning is being documented 
and shared effectively. Looking at options 
available is recommended for networks 
looking to create a shared online space and it 
is important to remember to assess network 
member capabilities and needs and involve 
them in the selection process.

Further research is needed in the area of 
developing effective networks for health and 
care, but the latest Health Foundation (2014) 
report gives an excellent overview of the 
evidence if further reading is necessary.
