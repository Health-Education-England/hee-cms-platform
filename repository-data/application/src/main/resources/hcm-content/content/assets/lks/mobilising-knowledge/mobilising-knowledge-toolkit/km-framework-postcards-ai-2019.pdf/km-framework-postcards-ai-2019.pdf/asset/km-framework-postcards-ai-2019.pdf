Appreciative Inquiry 

Use to celebrate what is already working well, analyse why and engage teams to do more of this to build 
upon past success and move towards the best future that can be imagined.    

1. Definition.  Frame the topic, what is the inquiry? 

3. Dream.  Small groups imagine what a positive outcome would look like.  What would we love to see 
happening? What’s different?  Energy is generated by expressing this future creatively.   

2. 

4. Design.  What must we do now to make our dreams a reality?  Think about actions, processes, systems, 
changes that could bring the dream into reality. 

Discovery. Be curious about how to build upon past success. What has worked well before and why?  
Capture each story in a single sentence. 

5. Delivery.  How will we take our topic forward? How will we measure success? Encourage  individuals to 
suggest ideas that they can own and take forward incrementally.
