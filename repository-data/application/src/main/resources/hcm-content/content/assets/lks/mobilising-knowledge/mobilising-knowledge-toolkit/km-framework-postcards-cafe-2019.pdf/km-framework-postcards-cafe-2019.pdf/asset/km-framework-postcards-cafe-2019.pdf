Knowledge Cafés 

Knowledge Cafés encourage productive conversations to help people learn from each other. They can help 
people to solve problems, break down silos, drive  innovation and build a community. The value of the Café is 
in the conversation itself and the learning that each individual takes away.

1–2 hours

Knowledge Cafés 

• Spend time devising a single open-ended   
 question to stimulate conversations

• Invite participants (between 12 – 24 people  
 is ideal)

• Arrange your room with small round tables  
 that can seat 4/5 people.

An invited speaker can introduce the theme but 
this should be limited to 15 minutes to allow 
adequate time for the conversation to take 
place.

If time is short consider running a 30 minute 
Espresso Café.

Options:

Before the Session: 

Facilitator explains how the café will run, 
introduces the theme and poses the question.

The small groups are invited to have a self-
facilitated conversation based upon the question. 

After 15 minutes groups are invited to swap tables 
to begin new conversations, meet new people and 
get different perspectives on the question.

After 45 minutes come back together as a full 
group to share ideas and learning from the 
conversations that have taken place. Individuals 
may suggest an actionable insight if appropriate.

If the group agrees, ideas from the conversation 
can  be captured and shared after the session but 
this must not inhibit the conversation.
