Improving access to local clinical 
guidelines 



Current challenges 
• Large numbers of guidelines 

• Hard to find 

• Unclear titles 

• Out of date 

• Multiple copies of the same document 

• Stored in a range of locations 

• Access to PCs/wifi 

• Guidelines often very long 

• Can be difficult to assess credibility: lack of author 

information, publication date, review date. 

 



Ignaz 
 

• An app designed to be used as a handbook for junior 
doctors 

• Named in honour of Dr Ignaz Semmelweis, the hand-
washing pioneer 

• Developed by HE Y&H. Currently used by 10 Trusts. 
• Once downloaded the app can be used without 

internet connectivity (so in ward setting) 
• Can be localized.  Used by Rotherham primarily to 

give clinicians easy access to clinical policies and 
procedures. 
 



• LKS commissioned by the Director of Medical Education to 
work with a Senior Clinical Fellow to  develop and populate 
the app 

• Launched in Rotherham in February 2015 

• Engaged with authors (consultants, nurses, pharmacists, 
managers) to capture new content 

• Designed to be used as a quick reference resource so large 
guidelines are broken down into bite-sized chunks 

• Categorised by specialty 

• Developed mechanisms to keep the content up-to-date 

• Promoted to specialty teams and as part of induction 

• Ignaz Handbook www.Ignaz.nhs.uk 

http://www.ignaz.nhs.uk/


How did we meet the criteria? 

• Create:  Localisation of ignaz to make guidelines/policies 
easily available; presentation of information in a quick 
reference format designed to be used at the point of care 

• Capture: Liaise with clinical authors to source key 
departmental policies to organise and manage on a central 
system 

• Share: Technology improve sharing of knowledge: not 
dependent on wifi 

• Use or re-use: Enabling the use of best practice through local 
guidelines to assist clinical effectiveness and cost effective use 
of resources. Ignaz: In the 2 months following junior doctor 
rotation we had 54 (Aug /Sept 2015) and 22 (Feb / Mar 2016) 
new users, this compares to 107 (50.5%) and 47 (46.8%) new 
doctors starting. 
 



Evidence

development of guidelines ; list of expired 
guidelines 

• Capture – gather and organising content from 
departments; advising on intranet structure, 
indexing documents, naming conventions 

• Share – New intranet site will improve access to 
guidelines, promote to colleagues, and provide 
end user assistance

intranet to access local guidelines.
