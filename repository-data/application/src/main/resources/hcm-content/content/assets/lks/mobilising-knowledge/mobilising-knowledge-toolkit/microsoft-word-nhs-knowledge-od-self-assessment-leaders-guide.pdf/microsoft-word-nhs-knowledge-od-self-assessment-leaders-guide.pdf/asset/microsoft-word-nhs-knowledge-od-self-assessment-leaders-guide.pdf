Instructions 
1. Current Practice 
Circle the level for each competency that you think your organisation/part of organisation is 
currently at. 

                               

Competencies                  Lowest    Highest 
 

 
 
2. Areas for Improvement 
Identify the two or three competencies that are most important for your organisation/part of 
organisation to improve in and by how many levels the improvement needs to go up. 
 
Circle this on the self-assessment form.   
 

                          
Tips 
The competencies that you select for improvement may not be the ones that you scored 
lowest. Some higher scored competencies may be more important for your organisation to 
progress. 
 
Often people think they need to focus on the more strategic aspects eg developing a strategic 
approach or leadership; however it is a good idea to have a mix, identifying at least one area 
where it is possible to achieve some quick wins.
