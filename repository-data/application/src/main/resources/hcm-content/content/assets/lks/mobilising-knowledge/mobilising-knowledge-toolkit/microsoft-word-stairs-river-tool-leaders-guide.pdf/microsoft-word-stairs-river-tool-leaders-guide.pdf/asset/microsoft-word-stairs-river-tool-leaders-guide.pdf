       Target level  
 

 

In the example above  
Jim and Wendy are currently on level two.  This is not one of their target areas for 
improvement so their names appear in the “0” column. 
 
Dick is also currently on level two.  However it is one of his areas for improvement, 
his target is level four. This is two levels higher than he is currently so his name 
appears on level two in column two,  two boxes across from Jim and Wendy’s. 
 
Sharing and Learning 
Dick could contact Bob on level four to find out what he did to get to this level, or he 
may first contact someone on level three.  Those on level three are operating at just 
one level above him and will be able to give him a few helpful suggestions that would 
help him to start to move up the stairs.
