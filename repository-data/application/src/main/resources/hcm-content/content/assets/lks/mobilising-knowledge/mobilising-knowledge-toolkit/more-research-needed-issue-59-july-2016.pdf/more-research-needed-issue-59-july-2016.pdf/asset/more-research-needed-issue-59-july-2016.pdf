Psychological preparation and postoperative out-
comes for adults undergoing surgery under general 
anaesthesia 
 
Authors' conclusions 
 
The evidence suggested that psychological preparation 
may be beneficial for the outcomes postoperative pain, 
behavioural recovery, negative affect and length of stay, 
and is unlikely to be harmful. However, at present, the 
strength of evidence is insufficient to reach firm conclu-
sions on the role of psychological preparation for sur-
gery. Further analyses are needed to explore the heter-
ogeneity in the data, to identify more specifically when 
intervention techniques are of benefit. As the current 
evidence quality is low or very low, there is a need for 
well-conducted and clearly reported research.

Biologic interventions for fatigue in rheumatoid ar-
thritis 
 
Authors' conclusions 
 
Treatment with biologic interventions in patients with 
active RA can lead to a small to moderate improvement 
in fatigue. The magnitude of improvement is similar for 
anti-TNF and non-anti-TNF biologics. However, it is un-
clear whether the improvement results from a direct ac-
tion of the biologics on fatigue or indirectly through re-
duction in inflammation, disease activity or some other 
mechanism.

The Cochrane Library and other sources regularly 
publish new reviews, some of which highlight the lack 
of good quality studies on which to base  
recommendations. This is a good starting point for 
identifying a new area of research. The second step is 
to find out what else has been published. If you 
would like a literature search on any of these topics 
please contact the Library Service on ext 3831.

CONCLUSION:  
 
There is currently no 'ideal' outcome assessment meas-
ure for use in paediatric palliative care. The domains of 
generic health-related quality-of-life measures are not 
relevant to all children receiving palliative care and 
some domains within disease-specific measures are 
only relevant for that specific population. Potential solu-
tions include adapting an existing measure or develop-
ing more individualized patient-centred outcome and 
experience measures. Either way, it is important to con-
tinue work on outcome measurement in this field.

Unravelling the confusion behind hyaluronic acid 
efficacy in the treatment of symptomatic knee      
osteoarthritis 
 
Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a commonly prescribed treat-
ment for knee pain resulting from osteoarthritis (OA). 
Although numerous HA products have been approved 
for use by the US Food and Drug Administration, the 
efficacy of HA injections for knee OA remains disputed 
with meta-analyses and societal clinical guidelines 
drawing disparate conclusions. The American Academy 
of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recently published a 
best-evidence systematic review and concluded that 
available data did not support the routine use of HA for 
knee OA. The purpose of the current article is to high-
light issues that confound interpretation of meta-
analyses on HA for knee OA, to provide realistic esti-
mates of the true efficacy of HA injections in knee OA, 
and to provide commentary on the methods and conclu-
sions from the AAOS systematic review. In general, the 
clinical benefit of HA is underestimated using conven-
tional meta-analytic techniques. When accounting for 
differential control group effects in HA studies, it can be 
reasonably concluded that HA injections may be benefi-
cial to an appreciable number of patients with knee OA. 
In addition, the systematic review methodology used by 
AAOS was questionable due to exclusion of numerous 
relevant studies and inclusion of studies that used HAs 
not approved for use in the US, both of which underesti-
mated the true efficacy of HA injections. Overall, the 
efficacy of HA injections for knee OA is likely better than 
previously reported. Future clinical trials and meta-
analyses should account for differential control group 
effects in order to avoid the continued confusion sur-
rounding HA injection efficacy.

Induction of labour at or near term for suspected 
fetal macrosomia 
 
Authors' conclusions 
 
Induction of labour for suspected fetal macrosomia has 
not been shown to alter the risk of brachial plexus injury, 
but the power of the included studies to show a differ-
ence for such a rare event is limited. Also antenatal esti-
mates of fetal weight are often inaccurate so many 
women may be worried unnecessarily, and many induc-
tions may not be needed. Nevertheless, induction of 
labour for suspected fetal macrosomia results in a lower 
mean birthweight, and fewer birth fractures and shoul-
der dystocia. The unexpected observation in the induc-
tion group of increased perineal damage, and the plau-
sible, but of uncertain significance, observation of in-
creased use of phototherapy, both in the largest trial, 
should also be kept in mind. 
Findings from trials included in the review suggest that 
to prevent one fracture it would be necessary to induce 
labour in 60 women. Since induction of labour does not 
appear to alter the rate of caesarean delivery or instru-
mental delivery, it is likely to be popular with many wom-
en. In settings where obstetricians can be reasonably 
confident about their scan assessment of fetal weight, 
the advantages and disadvantages of induction at or 
near term for fetuses suspected of being macrosomic 
should be discussed with parents. 
Although some parents and doctors may feel the evi-
dence already justifies induction, others may justifiably 
disagree. Further trials of induction shortly before term 
for suspected fetal macrosomia are needed. Such trials 
should concentrate on refining the optimum gestation of 
induction, and improving the accuracy of the diagnosis 
of macrosomia.

Thermal ablative therapies for treatment of localised 
renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review of the lit-
erature 
 
CONCLUSION:  
Thermal ablative therapies are valid alternatives to par-
tial nephrectomy for the treatment of small renal masses 
in patients unfit for surgery. Prospective long-term data 
will be needed before the indications for their use ex-
pand further.
