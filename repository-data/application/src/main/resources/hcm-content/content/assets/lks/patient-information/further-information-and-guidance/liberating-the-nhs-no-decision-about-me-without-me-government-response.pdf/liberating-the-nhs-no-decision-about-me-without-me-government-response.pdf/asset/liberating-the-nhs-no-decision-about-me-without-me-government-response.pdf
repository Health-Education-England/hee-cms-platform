1. The White Paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS1 set out the 
Government’s vision of an NHS that puts patients and the public first, where 
“no decision about me, without me” is the norm. It included proposals to give 
everyone more say over their care and treatment with more opportunity to make 
informed choices, as a means of securing better care and better outcomes. 

2. We have consulted widely on how to make this vision a reality. The first 
consultation document Liberating the NHS: Greater choice and control2 sought 
views on the choices that people wanted to make, when they wanted to make 
them and the support people needed to be able to have more say in decisions 
about their care.  Drawing on these responses, we began last year to introduce 
choice of provider in community services through the Any Qualified Provider 
policy and to extend choice to named consultant-led team in secondary care, 
where clinically appropriate. 

3. In May this year, we published a further consultation, Liberating the NHS: No 
decision about me, without me, which set out proposals for making “no decision 
about me, without me” a reality, all along the patient pathway: in primary care, 
before a diagnosis, at referral and after a diagnosis. The consultation asked for 
views as to whether these proposals met this objective, whether they were 
realistic and achievable and whether there were any areas we had not recognised 
sufficiently.  

4. The responses received were broadly supportive of the proposals set out in the 
consultation document as a means for patients to become more involved in their 
care, in partnership with professionals. 

5. Some respondents expressed the view that providing greater patient choice, be it 
over clinical team, setting, location or provider, did not equate to the widespread 
adoption of shared decision-making. We agree. We consider that greater patient 
involvement and greater patient choice are all part of the same goal: to ensure 
that “no decision about me, without me” becomes the norm.

6. Other themes raised regarding the practical implementation of the proposals 
relating both to patient involvement and patient choice were: 

i. The importance of providing accurate and accessible information in order 
for people to make informed decisions about their care.  

ii. The need for a culture change to enable patient involvement to become 
routine in the NHS.  

iii. The importance of making “no decision about me, without me” a reality 
for everyone, and the concern that, without proper implementation, the 
proposals might exacerbate health inequalities.  

 We outline below how we are responding to comments made by respondents 
and how we are implementing proposals on patient involvement and choice.  

7. The legal framework for this debate has changed. The Health and Social Care 
Act 2012 makes clear the duties on the NHS Commissioning Board and the 
clinical commissioning groups to promote the involvement of patients and 
carers in decisions about their care and treatment, and to enable patient choice. 
The Care and Support Bill, expected to be introduced to Parliament next year, 
focuses on the personalisation of care, with people, not institutions, in control. 
The draft Bill also creates a right to a care and support plan, which should be 
prepared in consultation with the person and carer. 

8. We heard clearly that a key element of patients being truly involved in decisions 
about their care and treatment is the ability of a patient to have a care plan. A 
written record of the care-planning discussion between a patient and clinician is 
a vital part of empowering patients to manage their condition. This is why we 
are introducing a pledge into the NHS Constitution to involve patients in care 
planning discussions and to offer them a written record of what is agreed, if they 
want one. The Government’s mandate will hold the NHS Commissioning Board 
to account for delivering this.  

9. The Department of Health’s Choice Framework for NHS funded care and 
treatment in England will set out, for the first time, the choices that people can 
expect to be offered. This will raise awareness of these choices, including where 
people have legal rights to make choices, as well as setting out where they can 
find information to support these choices and what they can do if they aren’t 
given the choices they are entitled to. 

10. These measures should all add up to a greater understanding of the rights of 
patients to be involved in their care and treatment, and the choices that they 
have available to them. This will all help to make “no decision about me, 
without me” a reality in the NHS.

1.1 This document sets out the Government’s response to the consultation exercise 
“Liberating the NHS: No decision about me, without me”3.   

Greater Choice and Control 

1.2 The White Paper, Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS, set out the 
Government’s vision of patients and the public being at the heart of the NHS. 
Central to delivering this vision is ensuring that all patients are fully involved in 
decisions about their own care and treatment so that the principle of shared 
decision-making - “no decision about me, without me”- becomes the norm 
across the NHS.   

1.3 The Department of Health committed to consult widely on the best ways to 
implement the White Paper commitments to give patients greater choice and 
control over their care and treatment.  Our consultation document, Liberating 
the NHS: Greater choice and control4, published in October 2010, set out some 
preliminary proposals to implement the White Paper commitments and asked a 
wide range of questions about how best to achieve these aims. Over 600 unique 
responses were received to this initial consultation.  

1.4 Guidance was published in 2011 to support implementation of the proposals to 
give patients greater choice of any qualified provider in community services and 
to give patients an opportunity to choose a named consultant-led team, where 
clinically appropriate.5 In both these areas, the response was brought forward 
because of the need to make rapid progress against the timetable set out in the 
White Paper and to ensure momentum was sustained. We published a summary 
of the responses received6 to the first consultation, alongside a subsequent 
consultation document, No decision about me, without me, in May this year.

No decision about me, without me 

1.5 In Liberating the NHS: No decision about me, without me, we outlined more 
detailed proposals to increase opportunities for patients and their representatives 
to have more involvement in decisions about their care all along the patient 
pathway.  We asked whether these proposals met this objective, whether they 
were realistic and achievable and whether there were any areas we had not 
recognised sufficiently. The consultation questions are set out in Annex B. 

1.6 Our detailed proposals were shaped by broad engagement undertaken by the 
Department of Health and others. In 2011 the Future Forum were asked to make 
recommendations on promoting choice and managing competition. We took 
account of their recommendations as well as responses to the consultation in 
developing the proposals. 

1.7 These proposals also support the delivery of the Government’s Open Public 
Services agenda, which was set out in the 2011 Open Public Services White 
Paper7. This agenda aims to ensure that everyone has access to the best possible 
public services, and that the best become better still. This will be achieved by 
improvements driven by decentralising power to ensure that public service 
providers are accountable to the people that use them. 

Consultation responses  

1.8 This second round of consultation was originally expected to run for a period of 
8 weeks as it was clearly linked to the earlier consultation. The consultation 
period was extended to fourteen weeks after a number of organisations 
requested additional time to undertake discussion meetings with their members 
before submitting formal responses.  The published consultation documents, 
including accompanying Impact Assessment and Equality documents, were 
made available via the Department of Health website from 23rd May 2012 until 
31st August 20128. Respondents were able to submit their replies online, by 
email or by post.    

1.9 The consultation document was intended to be accessible to all. It was also 
published as an Easy Read document and in audio CD format to encourage 
responses from the largest possible audience.  A set of information slides were 
made available to assist organisations when undertaking engagement with their 
members or as part of discussion forums.

1.10 In total, 172 valid9 responses were received to the consultation. Of these, 47 
were from individuals with the remaining 125 from a range of organisations 
including voluntary organisations, local authorities, NHS organisations, Royal 
Colleges and patient representative groups. Some respondents chose not to 
respond directly to the questions posed, preferring instead to submit overarching 
comments on the proposals or general aims of the White Paper commitments. 

1.11 The chart below provides a breakdown of the respondents. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our response  

1.12 In subsequent chapters of this document we provide a summary of the responses 
that we received to this consultation exercise and describe our final proposals 
informed by what we’ve heard. 

1.13 It is not possible to provide detail of all of the responses. Annex C sets out 
tables summarising the key issues raised by respondents as well as providing an 
indication of the relative importance of the issues based on the frequency with 
which they were raised.  

1.14 In this document, whenever we refer to involving patients in decisions and 
giving them more choice, it applies equally to adults and children who are 
patients, service users and carers, their families and others who represent and 
support them, unless otherwise stated.  

9 Two further responses could not be linked to the consultation questions and so were discounted.

1.15 Chapter 3 sets out the key cross-cutting themes that have emerged, outlines the 
issues raised and our response. 

1.16 In chapters 4 and 5, we discuss responses concerning specific proposals on 
increasing patient involvement and patient choice in turn. We set out issues that 
have been raised regarding our proposals in these areas and we describe how we 
have addressed these points. 

1.17 Chapter 6 concludes this document setting out the next steps we will be taking 
to make “no decision about me, without me” a reality in the NHS.  

1.18 The Health and Social Care Act (2012)10 establishes new organisations, which 
will have a key role in implementing the proposals to give patients more say and 
greater involvement in care and treatment decisions in the new healthcare 
system. These will include, but are not limited to, the NHS Commissioning 
Board, Monitor, clinical commissioning groups and providers as well as the 
Department of Health. The proposals set out in this document are the proposals 
of the Department of Health. New organisations will consider these proposals 
and the response to this further consultation as they take on their functions.

2.1 Respondents were broadly supportive of the proposals set out to increase patient 
involvement and patient choice and the benefits that the proposals will bring. 

 “Proposals to empower patients to make shared decisions at all stages of care 
and treatment is acknowledged by the County Council as a step in the right 
direction in providing patients with greater choice and flexibility in how and 
when they receive their treatment.” [Staffordshire County Council] 

 “Bupa supports the Government’s ambition to involve patients fully in their 
own care by giving them a choice over their care and treatment.” [Bupa] 

 “The potential benefits of SDM [shared decision-making] include better 
consultations, clearer risk communication, improved health literacy, more 
appropriate decisions, fewer unwanted treatments, healthier lifestyles, improved 
confidence and self-efficacy, safer care, greater compliance with ethical 
standards, reduced costs and better health outcomes.” [Royal College of 
General Practitioners] 

2.2 Respondents identified a range of issues relating to how the proposals are 
implemented, which we have considered and taken into account. In this chapter 
we summarise the key themes that emerged from the consultation responses and 
how we have addressed these points, or taken them into account in our 
proposals. There are themes that apply equally to proposals to involve patients 
more and to give them more choice. We consider issues specific to greater 
patient involvement or patient choice respectively in subsequent chapters. 

Patient involvement and patient choice 

2.3 In response to the consultation document, some respondents clearly expressed  
the view that providing greater patient choice, be it over clinical team, setting, 
location or provider, did not equate to the widespread adoption of shared 
decision-making. We agree.  

2.4 We consider that greater patient involvement and greater patient choice are all 
part of the same goal: to ensure that “no decision about me, without me” 
becomes the norm. This would be achieved through greater patient involvement 
in decisions about their care where patient involvement may mean better shared 
decision making, better care planning, or more support for self-care. This would 

2. What we heard: key themes  

7 
 



 

also be achieved through greater patient choice. We believe everyone should 
have choice as a patient; choice of who provides care, of when and where care 
is provided, and a choice of clinical team.  

2.5 We recognise that shared decision-making is not a new concept. It has been the 
subject of much academic research and has a specific meaning:  

 “Shared decision making is a process in which clinicians and patients work 
together to select tests, treatments, management or support packages, based on 
clinical evidence and the patient’s informed preferences. It involves the 
provision of evidence-based information about options, outcomes and 
uncertainties, together with decision support counselling and a system for 
recording and implementing patients’ informed preferences.”11  

2.6 We acknowledge this definition of shared decision-making and that this is but 
one element of patient involvement and one means of securing “no decision 
about me, without me”. Greater involvement of patients in decisions about their 
care and treatment should encompass all instances where patients make 
decisions about any aspect of their care and treatment. This could be achieved 
through better personal care planning, self-management, as well as through 
shared decision-making as defined above.  

2.7 “No decision about me, without me” will also be achieved by giving patients 
more choices about where they might be treated and by whom.  By having more 
say in who provides their treatment, where and when that treatment takes place, 
as well as what treatment to have, people will be able to become far more active 
participants in decisions about their health and healthcare. 

2.8 Bringing this about will require a change in the relationship between patients 
and clinicians, to recognise that both are experts. Clinicians provide clinical 
expertise and knowledge about diagnosis and treatment, while patients are the 
experts in their condition and have knowledge of their personal preferences. By 
sharing their knowledge, the patient and clinician can work together and choose 
the best next step in the patient’s care and treatment.  

2.9 We have fully considered these points in developing our approach. The 
following chapters address patient involvement and patient choice in turn, 
where we describe the key points raised in responses to the consultation under 
these headings and outline our final proposals in light of what we heard during 
the consultation.

Culture change 

2.10 A recurring theme throughout the consultation responses was the need for a 
culture shift in the NHS for “no decision about me, without me” to become the 
norm:  

 “We would support any steps towards changing the culture among health 
professionals, so that patient involvement is the natural expectation.” [Sign 
Health] 

2.11 We agree that there is a significant challenge in changing the culture of both 
health professionals, and of patients, so that both expect there to be greater 
patient involvement in decisions. Some respondents suggested the use of 
specific training and education programmes, particularly for primary care 
professionals, to equip clinicians with the skills necessary to help patients and 
the public understand their options to be involved in decisions about their care. 
Many clinicians already view patient involvement as a key part of any 
consultation but we want to make sure that best practice becomes common 
practice. 

 “If SDM is to become part of the NHS culture, it starts with the culture change 
in the NHS which requires education and support for NHS clinicians.” [North 
West London Hospitals Trust]    

2.12 This is why the Right Care Shared Decision Making Programme12 is developing 
training and education resources to embed the principles of shared decision-
making into the curricula for a wide range of healthcare staff, including nurses, 
GPs, consultants and NHS managers, as well as for commissioners. In addition, 
the programme aims to raise awareness of shared decision-making amongst 
patients, their family and carers and the wider public, by working with 
advocates within the voluntary sector. 

2.13 We were pleased that the Royal College of General Practitioners are “glad to 
support” our proposal to work with the Royal Colleges and other organisations 
to explore the potential and opportunities to ensure education reinforces shared 
decision-making as the norm. We look forward to working with the RCGP and 
their colleagues to make progress in this area. 

2.14 Some respondents raised concerns that the time currently allotted to 
consultations was insufficient to involve patients fully in discussions and 
decisions about their care. There is no evidence to suggest this is the case. The

by the East of England SHA. http://www.rightcare.nhs.uk/shareddecisions/

accompanying Impact Assessment assesses in full the expected impacts, costs 
and benefits of these proposals, including the impact on consultation times.  

Ensuring everyone benefits from “No decision about me, without 
me” 

2.15 There was strong support for the proposal that every patient should be as 
actively involved in making decisions about their health and healthcare as they 
wish to be: 

 “Carers UK shares the Government’s aim of increasing patients’ involvement 
in decisions about their care and welcomes the publication of this further 
consultation giving greater detail on where patients can expect to share 
decision making.” [Carers UK] 

2.16 However, some respondents were concerned that the proposals would not be 
accessible to everyone, if those who required specialist or extra support to make 
decisions about their care, did not receive the support they needed: 

 “There is a risk that shared decision-making will have a distorting effect on 
consultation time spent with patients – put simply, the more articulate, better 
educated and more assertive patients may be encouraged to demand more time 
with their GP to discuss options – whilst those who are less literate but who 
have greater needs may lose out.” [Royal College of General Practitioners] 

2.17 We fully acknowledge these concerns. One of the main purposes of giving 
patients more say in decisions about their care and treatment is to deliver greater 
equity within the NHS. A report by the King’s Fund13 found that more affluent 
people have historically been better at navigating their way around the NHS or 
have the choice of opting out of the NHS altogether. Making “no decision about 
me, without me” accessible to everyone means inequalities can be reduced by 
providing a choice for those who previously had no choice but to stay with their 
local services or providers. We fully consider the impacts of our policies in the 
Impact Assessment and Equality Analysis published alongside this document. 

2.18 We have been clear in the Government's information strategy for health and 
care in England14 that information must be provided in a way that is appropriate 
to the individual, and that people, carers and their representatives should be 
fully supported in accessing and using that information to make an informed

decision. This is backed up by the right in the Constitution to “be involved in 
discussions and decisions about your healthcare, and to be given information to 
enable you to do this”15.  

2.19 We are also clear that commissioners of health and care services should 
recognise the benefits of ensuring appropriate information and communication 
support being made available for those who need it. This may include the use of 
a translator service for those where English is not their first language, or 
considering alternative forms of information.  

2.20 We recognise that each patient will have specific needs in terms of information 
and support. While we cannot account for every circumstance, we strongly 
encourage commissioners to consider individual needs, in line with the relevant 
duties in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 Act16 to reduce inequalities 
between patients with respect to the accessibility of health services, and the 
outcomes achieved by the provision of those services.  

2.21 We also acknowledge the importance of ensuring that no one should be          
disadvantaged as a result of the chosen means of providing information. For 
example, some rural communities may lack access to the internet, and in some 
cases may lack the skills to go online. Action is being taken by, the Government 
and a range of partners to address these issues, but we also recognise that 
alternative means of communication and information provision may also need 
to be considered in certain circumstances 

2.22 Many community organisations exist to meet the needs of people who are 
vulnerable or disadvantaged or, because of cultural issues, face barriers when 
accessing state or publicly run services and do not receive the support they 
need. We encourage GPs and clinical commissioning groups to consider the role 
of the voluntary sector, especially when they are in a position to offer better-
targeted information.  

“A focus on education and new forms of information and information channels 
will be required as people could not make informed decisions if they do not 
have the right information.” [SHA Long Term Conditions Leads] 

2.23 Further, local Healthwatch will have an important role in providing, or 
signposting, people and carers to information about local health and care 
services and how best to access these services. It will have a seat on the new 
health and wellbeing boards, ensuring that the views and experiences of

patients, carers and other service users are taken into account when local needs 
assessments and strategies are prepared. Local Healthwatch will also be able to 
help and support clinical commissioning groups to make sure that services 
really are designed to meet citizens’ needs.  

2.24 Many respondents specifically welcomed the steps proposed in the consultation 
to achieve equal opportunities for choice for users of mental health services, 
wherever possible.  

“The focus on mental health in the consultation is welcome. As the document 
itself recognises, this is an area of health care where progress on real patient 
choice has often fallen behind” [Independent Mental Health Services Alliance] 

“We agree that it is important that where possible the choices available to 
patients using secondary care are also available to patients who undergoing 
treatment for mental health issues.” [The Patients Association] 

2.25 The Health and Social Care Act 2012 made it clear that a comprehensive health 
service must address both the physical and mental health needs of patients in 
England. Section 1of the NHS Act 2006 now states that the National Health 
Service should improve both the physical and mental health of the population 
and that it should give equal priority to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment 
of both physical and mental illness. 

Information 

2.26 Many responses to the consultation highlighted the importance of providing 
information for people to be able to make informed decisions. 

“The consultation document rightly notes the importance of good quality 
information to enable patients to become actively involved in decisions about 
their care.” [Specialised Healthcare Alliance] 

2.27 We agree that central to the vision of patient-centred care, is the principle of 
providing a wide range of appropriate, accessible and timely information 
enabling people to make informed decisions. From April 2011, providers have 
been required to publish information about their services so that people can use 
this to make informed choices about their healthcare17. As we explain above, 
the NHS Constitution18 sets out the right for people to make choices about their 
NHS care and to information to support these choices.

2.28 Where possible, information should be available in a variety of formats so that 
all groups can access it, including those with learning disabilities, those with 
hearing or sight impairments and non-English speaking people. This may 
include the provision of interpreters so that patients with specific language or 
communication difficulties can communicate freely with healthcare 
professionals.  

2.29 Part of the Right Care Shared Decision Making programme has focused on 
delivering 36 patient decision aids in a variety of formats, to help patients 
understand and consider the pros and cons of possible treatment options. The 
decision aids are a valuable tool in providing information in a format that helps 
patients to make an informed decision and encourages communication between 
patients and healthcare professionals. 

2.30 Some respondents raised concerns about the capacity and compatibility of the 
IT systems to be able to support the proposals. Having chosen a hospital, and 
perhaps a named consultant-led team, a patient would expect that team to have 
received their health and care record and any test results, to best inform their 
clinical advice. 

“The proposals are challenging and caution must be taken to ensure 
uncoordinated care pathways are not inadvertently introduced: IT systems and 
interrelationships with different providers must be strong and resilient for these 
proposals to be successful.” [The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh] 

2.31 We recognise that the systems currently in place are not always as joined-up as 
they need to be, and a key ambition of the Information Strategy is: “Information 
recorded once, at first contact, and shared securely between those providing 
our care – supported by consistent use of information standards that enable 
data to flow whilst keeping our confidential information safe and secure.”19 

2.32 The strategy proposes an approach, based on nationally set information 
standards, which will enable information to be captured once and shared right 
across the health and care system. It will be for the Department of Health and 
the NHS Commissioning Board to agree, by April 2013, how to take this 
forward.  

2.33 The strategy also sets out the steps to enable electronic access to people’s own 
GP records. This will support individuals to take more control of their own 
health and care and to work with professionals to ensure that there really is “no 
decision about me without me”.

Quality and continuity of care 

2.34 Some respondents were concerned about the risk of fragmentation of care as a 
result of providing a choice of provider, and the risk of a variation in the quality 
of care if it was provided by non-NHS service providers: 

 “The consultation document does not make clear how governance will work 
across the full patient pathway. With fragmentation of care amongst providers 
there are dangers that no one organisation will have responsibility for ensuring 
that the quality of care meets required standards.” [North East Yorkshire and 
Humber Clinical Alliance] 

2.35 It is precisely by giving people more choice over their care that the Government 
aims to enable all patients to access the highest quality providers of healthcare 
services. Encouraging people to ‘vote with their feet’ by making choices about 
their care will strengthen the incentives of the NHS to meet patient requirements 
and improve the quality of services.  

2.36 We are not advocating a ‘one size fits all’ approach to patient choice: it is for 
commissioners to decide how best to commission services. Where integration is 
particularly important, commissioners might decide that one provider is 
responsible for care planning and delivery, whilst still offering choice of 
treatment, setting and lead clinician.  

2.37 Where patients are offered choice of provider, the providers will be 
contractually obliged to co-operate so that patient care is safe, transfers are co-
ordinated properly, and patient experience is good. As is the case now, GPs will 
be there to help patients navigate the system, advising patients to make sure 
they have continuity. If continuity of care or integration issues arise, clinical 
commissioning groups will be able to address these with providers directly.  

2.38 The Health and Social Care Act 2012 places a clear duty on both the NHS 
Commissioning Board, and the clinical commissioning groups20, to ensure 
health services are provided in an integrated way so as to improve the quality of 
those services (including the outcomes that are achieved from their provision), 
and to reduce inequalities.

3.1 This chapter outlines the specific issues we heard regarding proposals on 
increasing patient involvement, and our response. 

3.2 The NHS Act 2006 places a clear duty on the NHS Commissioning Board, and 
the clinical commissioning groups to: 

 “…promote the involvement of patients, and their carers and representatives (if 
any), in decisions which relate to—  

(a) the prevention or diagnosis of  illness in the patients, or  
(b) their care or treatment.” 21 

3.3 The consultation proposed a number of ways to help support this duty including 
proposals to formalise an offer of personalised care planning, the further roll out 
of personal health budgets (subject to evaluation), and a greater focus on those 
with long-term conditions. Respondents raised a number of specific issues 
relating to these points. 

Ensuring everyone is involved in decisions about their care 

3.4 We clearly heard the importance of care planning in ensuring people are as 
involved as they wish to be in deciding which care and support services to use:  

 “National Voices is heartened to see that the important role of personalised 
care planning is acknowledged in the consultation document. However, we are 
concerned that the Department of Health’s statistics overestimate the extent to 
which care plans are already in use.” [National Voices] 

 “The RCN is supportive of the wider provision and use of personalised care 
planning, both within healthcare, and across healthcare and social care.” 
[Royal College of Nurses] 

3.5 We know from survey evidence22 that most people with long-term conditions 
will have a discussion with their health professional about how to manage their 

21 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted 13H 
22 The GP Patient Survey showed that 83% of people with a long-term condition had had a discussion 
about their condition(s).  Many also reported that they were given information about their condition(s) 
and felt the doctor or nurse took notice of their views. 

3. Greater patient involvement  

15 
 

                                                 

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents/enacted


 

condition. This is a good start but we want to go further. Wherever possible we 
want this discussion to lead to a formal personalised care plan, developed jointly 
and agreed between the professional and the patient, to facilitate greater patient 
involvement in decisions about their care, treatment and support. 

3.6 We have been actively looking at ways to strengthen the role of personalised 
care planning. We set out further details in Chapter 6.   

3.7 We have been clear about the role of telehealth and telecare technology23 in 
supporting more involvement in care decisions. We have developed the 3 
million lives24 initiative, which aims to improve the lives of 3 million people 
with long-term conditions over the next 5 years using telehealth and telecare 
technologies. The programme will also help to educate healthcare providers and 
patients on how this technology can best be used in health and care services.  

Mental health 

3.8 We also heard the importance of involving all patients and service users, 
including those using mental health services, in decisions about their care and 
treatment: 

 “People with mental health problems are often experts in their own symptoms 
and support needs, meaning shared decision-making can lead to more effective 
treatment and improved patient outcomes, while involvement in making 
decisions can be an important part of the recovery process in itself.” [Mind] 

3.9 As we set out earlier, the Government for the first time has made clear the equal 
status of mental and physical health in law, through the passing of the Health 
and Social Care Act 2012.  The Secretary of State’s mandate specifically tasks 
the NHS Commissioning Board to put mental health on a par with physical 
health, and close the health gap between people with mental health problems 
and the population as a whole.  The Board will be held to account to deliver on 
the mandate. 

3.10 In other areas, we heard from several groups that there was the risk that those 
who required tailored information and support may be left behind by these 
proposals, unless they were properly implemented. 

Mental capacity 

23 http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/Yourhealth/Pages/Telecare.aspx  
24 http://www.3millionlives.co.uk

http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/Yourhealth/Pages/Telecare.aspx
http://www.3millionlives.co.uk/


 

3.11 Concerns were raised about the ability of some GPs and other clinical staff to 
adequately manage the needs of patients with conditions that affect their mental 
capacity, such as dementia or learning disabilities.  

 “For patients who lack capacity, the views of carers and other interested 
parties must be collated in order to make a best-interests shared decision. All 
principles in relation to Mental Capacity Act legislation should be adhered to in 
the process.”  [The Royal College of Psychiatrists] 

3.12 The Mental Capacity Act 2005 is a vital piece of legislation underpinning the 
NHS that requires all health professionals to take 'all practicable steps' to help 
people make their own decisions, even where they have a mental impairment. 
Just because a patient has a mental impairment does not mean that those patients 
and their carers should not be involved in decisions about their care. Options 
may need to be communicated in different, or more appropriate ways and 
patients need to be supported in understanding the options and their 
implications, as well as being assisted in making and communicating their 
choices. The principles of the Mental Capacity Act must be adhered to in any 
decision making where a patient lacks capacity or their capacity is predicted to 
deteriorate over time. 

3.13 In cases where people’s capacity is predicted to deteriorate over time, for 
example if they are diagnosed with early stage dementia, personalised care 
plans would be a useful way to enable them to plan how they would like their 
health needs met when they lose capacity. They will also be an important tool to 
help those who have fluctuating capacity retain more control when they become 
unwell.  When planning care with people who lack mental capacity, it is 
important that the person be supported to have the fullest input possible into 
decisions affecting them.  Their family, carers and representatives should also 
be fully involved in developing the plans for the future.  

Children and young people 

3.14 Other people responded specifically to highlight that involvement of children 
and young people in decisions about their care and treatment was not 
appropriately recognised in the consultation document:  

 “Children and young people want to engage in shared decision making and 
government should consider the barriers they experience to achieving this, 
alongside good practice, and children and young people’s own suggestions for 
improvements.” [National Children’s Bureau and the Council for Disabled 
Children] 

17 
 



 

3.15 We agree that the principles of patient involvement apply equally to all people, 
regardless of age, and acknowledge that children and young people may require 
additional support to be fully involved in decisions about their care. 

3.16 In January 2012, the Secretary of State for Health established a Forum to help 
develop a new strategy for improving care for children and young people. The 
Forum published its report25 in July 2012 setting out recommendations on how 
the health and care system can help deliver the necessary improvements to 
improve care for children and young people. The Department is now using the 
Forum Report as a basis for finalising the composition of the Children and 
Young People’s Health Outcomes Strategy, which is due to be published 
shortly. 

3.17 The Department of Health has also published quality criteria for young people 
friendly health services – You’re Welcome26. The criteria set out principles to 
help commissioners and service providers to improve the suitability of NHS and 
public health services for young people, based on the evidence of what works in 
the health service, and in response to what young people tell us about the 
importance of services designed around their needs.  

Personal Health Budgets 

3.18 Respondents also gave their clear support to the proposals regarding the 
availability of personal health budgets.  

 “Personal Health Budgets, where they have been used to date, have been seen 
to improve patient experience and outcomes.” [African Health Policy Network] 

3.19 Personal health budgets are currently being piloted, with an evaluation of the 
pilot due later this autumn. Subject to the evaluation, all people (including 
children) receiving NHS Continuing Healthcare will have the right to ask for a 
personal health budget by April 2014. Clinical commissioning groups will also 
be able to offer them more widely on a voluntary basis.

4.1 We heard that while increasing patient choice of provider alone will not make a 
reality of patient-centred care, it plays a vital role alongside the policies on 
patient involvement. 

 “Giving patients a greater say in their care and giving them more opportunities 
to choose for themselves what they want is certainly commendable and to be 
welcomed.” [The Patients Association] 

4.2 The NHS Act 200627 makes this point clearly with a duty for the Board and 
clinical commissioning groups to promote both patient involvement and patient 
choice. The Act requires the Board and clinical commissioning groups to:  

 “act with a view to enabling patients to make choices with respect to aspects of 
health services provided to them.” 

4.3 In April 2011 the NHS Future Forum was asked to report on the role of choice 
and competition in improving quality in the NHS. A recommendation of the 
Forum was for the Secretary of State’s mandate to the NHS Commissioning 
Board to set clear expectations for the Board regarding choice.  

4.4 In response to this recommendation the Department of Health is publishing a 
Choice Framework for NHS funded care and treatment in England that sets out, 
for the first time, the choices available to patients all along the care pathway and 
across services. The NHS Choice Framework supports the delivery of the 
Government’s Open Public Services agenda. This agenda aims to ensure that 
everyone has access to the best possible public services, and that the best 
become better still. By making clear the choices that the public have over their 
healthcare, more people will be encouraged to make choices that best meet their 
needs and preferences. This will drive improvements in the services provided, 
as they will be more directly accountable to their patients. We say more about 
the NHS Choice Framework in the next chapter. 

Choice of GP  

4.5 Many responses welcomed proposals to enable people to register with the GP 
practice that best suits their needs. 

27 As inserted by the Health and Social Care Act 2012 

4. Greater patient choice: all along the pathway  

19 
 

                                                 



 

 “Looking ahead, we are particularly supportive of greater choice in primary 
care - giving patients the choice of GP practice rather than just of GP.  This 
proposal will enable patients to choose GPs who offer the best, most responsive 
services, and which suit the needs of different communities and reflect changing 
lifestyles.” [The NHS Partners Network] 

4.6 Choice of GP practice is currently being piloted in three areas in England.  This 
pilot scheme is subject to a full independent evaluation and due to report in the 
summer of 2013. The results of the evaluation will inform future arrangements. 

Mental health services 

4.7 People also welcomed the proposal to provide a right for mental health service 
users to choose any team led by a clinically appropriate professional28.  

 “In relation to mental health services, it should also be noted that as many 
mental health teams do not operate along a consultant led model, there is a 
danger that the public will perceive this as a deficit, given the current focus on 
consultant led services…Extending this approach to choice of team led by a 
clinically appropriate professional would help in this respect, but this 
distinction will need to be communicated effectively to patients.” [The 
Foundation Trust Network] 

4.8 The Handbook to the NHS Constitution currently sets out patients’ legal rights 
to choose.29 The scope of this legal right is currently limited to choice of 
provider when referred to most elective services. Having received positive 
responses to our proposals in the consultation, the scope of this right will be 
extended to include the named consultant-led team you see when referred to 
secondary care and, for the first time, a right to choose the named professionally 
led team that you see for secondary care mental health services for your first 
outpatient appointment. The legal basis for these rights will be the Standing 
Rules regulations and we intend to update the Handbook to the NHS 
Constitution to reflect the extended scope. 

28 Schedule 1 of the Mental Health Act 1983 Approved Clinician (General) directions 2008 defines 
clinically appropriate professionals as: a chartered psychologist who is listed in the British  
psychological Society's Register of Chartered Psychologists and who holds a relevant practising 
certificate issued by that Society: a first level nurse, registered in Sub-Part 1 of the Nurses and Part of 
the Register maintained under article 5 of the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 with the inclusion of 
an entry indicating their field of practice in mental health or learning disabilities nursing; an 
occupational therapist registered in Part 6 of the Register maintained under article 5 of the Health 
Professions Order 2001.

http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_132959.pdf


 

4.9 Some respondents were concerned that the payment systems for mental health 
services were not sufficiently developed to enable choice to be put on a par with 
most acute elective health services. 

 “In mental health, more work is also needed on standard specifications and 
national tariffs before choice between organisations can be developed further.” 
[Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys] 

4.10 For too long people who are referred to mental health services have not been 
given the same choices as those referred to other elective services. Currently, 
mental health services are an exception to the 'free choice' offer that states that a 
patient has the right to choose any provider in England for a first outpatient 
appointment with a consultant or a member of the consultant's team for most 
elective care. This must change. As we set out earlier, the Government is 
committed to ensuring mental health has equal priority with physical health, and 
the Health and Social Care Act 2012 is clear that equal priority must be given to 
the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of both physical and mental illness.  

4.11 Having heard clear messages of the importance of ensuring equal priority of 
mental and physical health services, we intend to remove this exception to free 
choice in due course. This will give us time to bring about the changes that are 
necessary for removing the exemption, including in relation to payment systems 
and integration between mental health, social care and other services. 

4.12 Some respondents also questioned the availability of real choice, due to limited 
capacity of some services. 

 “There is currently insufficient supply of high quality mental health services to 
meet demand. This means that far from being offered choice of service, patients 
are more likely to face long waiting times to receive mental health 
interventions.” [Mind] 

4.13 To increase capacity of mental health services, the Government is investing 
over £400 million to increase access to NICE Approved Psychological 
Therapies. We are continuing to increase the choice of therapy options in the 
Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme and we are extending 
the scope of the programme to include children and young people, people with a 
long-term condition, severe mental illness or personality disorder.  

4.14 Patients will have an increased choice of provider in the community through the 
Any Qualified Provider programme and we are developing a robust payment 
system to incentivise routine patient choice of therapy.  Personal health budgets 
are also being piloted for people with mental health needs as a way of giving 
people more choice and control and could be rolled out in due course, subject to 
evaluation. 

21 
 



 

Maternity 

4.15 We heard clear support for our proposals on maternity: women, together with 
their midwife or clinician, should be able to plan their care throughout the 
maternity pathway. 

  “We welcome the maternity-specific initiatives mentioned in the document, and 
are confident that they will help to empower women to make decisions about 
their care. However, we do not believe that these initiatives alone will be 
sufficient to enable truly shared-decision making” [Royal College of Midwives] 

4.16 We agree that we should do more to promote the choices available to women on 
the maternity pathway. This is why we have set out clearly the choices available 
to women in the Choice Framework. The Framework explains the choices 
women have over who provides their care, where to give birth and how to 
receive care after the birth. 

Diagnostic testing 

4.17 A concern we heard about the proposals to increase choice in diagnostic testing 
was that there were limitations due to the lack of interoperability of some 
systems including clinical access to comprehensive diagnostic test data and 
reports.  One issue raised was the interaction of the Radiology Information 
Systems and Choose and Book. 

 “We note the existing concern relating to incompatibility of Radiology 
Information Systems (RIS) and Choose & Book “. [British Medical Association]  

4.18 We fully recognise the point and this has been identified as an area for further 
work both in the ‘No decision about me, without me’ consultation, and in the 
Information Strategy. We are currently looking at how best to improve the 
compatibility of these systems. 

4.19 We want patients to have a choice of diagnostic test provider, whether tests take 
place in community care settings (through any qualified provider), or in 
secondary care. As well as being able to choose any provider in England when 
referred to a consultant-led first outpatient appointment for diagnostic tests, 
patients can expect to have choices over their diagnostic care provider where the 
test does not take place as part of a first consultant-led outpatient appointment. 
We set out in May that the National Clinical Directors would confirm the 
priority areas where this offer should apply.  

4.20 We can now confirm that the categories of diagnostic test that are priority areas 
are: 

22 
 



 

• Endoscopy (gastroscopy, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, flexible 
sigmoidoscopy) 

• Imaging (e.g. non-obstetric ultrasound, CT, MRI, DEXA, plain film scans) 

• Physiology (e.g. audiology assessments, electrocardiogram, 
echocardiogram) 

• Other diagnostic tests (e.g. genetics and pathology) are priority areas, but a 
decision on which tests to include has not yet been made.  

4.21 The Department of Health is currently considering different tariff options for 
diagnostic testing, which could further support patient choice. 

 

23 
 



 

 

5.1 We have reported and discussed the issues that were raised during the 
consultation: both positive messages about the benefits of our proposals and 
also clear messages about the importance of implementing the proposals 
correctly. This chapter sets out the steps we are taking to make the vision of a 
patient-centred NHS a reality. 

The legal framework 

5.2 We acknowledge  the message that patient involvement and patient choice are 
distinct, yet complementary, parts of “no decision about me, without me”. The 
NHS Act 2006 (as inserted by the Health and Social Care Act 2012) places clear 
duties on the NHS Commissioning Board and the clinical commissioning 
groups to: 

 “…promote the involvement of patients, and their carers and representatives (if 
any), in decisions which relate to—  

(a) the prevention or diagnosis of  illness in the patients, or  

(b) their care or treatment.”  

 And to: 

 “act with a view to enabling patients to make choices with respect to aspects of 
health services provided to them.” 

The Mandate 

5.3 On 13 November, the Secretary of State published a Mandate30 to the NHS 
Commissioning Board. This document sets out the objectives the Board should 
seek to meet and those where the Secretary of State will hold the NHS 
Commissioning Board to account. The Board will be required to publish a 
business plan at the start of each year setting out how it will achieve its 
objectives.

5. Conclusion: making it happen

http://mandate.dh.gov.uk/


 

5.4 The mandate sets out a clear ambition that the NHS should become dramatically 
better at involving patients and their carers, and empower them to manage and 
make decisions about their own care and treatment.  The mandate also expects 
that by 2015, the Commissioning Board will have fully embedded all patients’ 
legal rights to make choices about their care, and extended choice in areas 
where no legal right yet exists. 

The NHS Constitution 

5.5 Patients are currently entitled to make choices and be involved in decisions 
about their health and care, as set out in the NHS Constitution: 

 “You have the right to make choices about your NHS care and to information to 
support these choices.” 

 And 

 “You have the right to be involved in discussions and decisions about your 
healthcare, and to be given information to enable you to do this.” 

5.6 The consultation on the Constitution has been launched31 seeking views on 
proposals for strengthening the content in the NHS Constitution. The 
consultation seeks views on the proposals to strengthen the Constitution with an 
amended principle that the NHS aspires to put patients at the heart of everything 
it does. The consultation also proposes amending several rights and pledges to 
reflect more clearly that the NHS supports individuals to manage their own 
health and involves them, their families and carers in decisions that affect them. 
In support of views about the importance of care planning, it also proposes 
creating a new pledge to involve patients in discussions about planning their 
care and to offer them a written record of what is agreed. The consultation is 
open to responses until Monday 28 January. 

Providing information to support decisions 

5.7 The provision of information is a key part of the vision of “no decision about 
me, without me” becoming the norm. We set out in the Information Strategy32 
the vision of people being able to access and share their own health and care 
records, to help people take part in decisions about their own care in a genuine

partnership with professionals. The strategy emphasises the importance of 
providing support to those who need it in interpreting and using the information 
available, to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in decisions 
about their own care and treatment. It also sets out an approach, based on 
nationally set information standards, to achieve fully joined-up systems to 
enable information to be captured once and shared right across the health and 
care system 

5.8 Since 2007 NHS Choices33 has been the online “front door” to the NHS. It is 
the country's biggest health website and provides the information a patient 
needs to make choices about their health. This includes information on choosing 
between treatment options and choosing healthcare providers. 

5.9 We also provide Choose and Book; an electronic referral and booking system 
that allows patients to see the appointments available to them at different 
providers, and then to book an appointment either with the GP who refers them, 
or via the internet or telephone. The system is a key means in ensuring that 
patients and their referrers have the opportunity to choose clinically appropriate 
providers and appointments that suit them, both in terms of where the 
appointment takes place, and when it takes place. 

Promoting patient involvement 

5.10 The responses to the consultation clearly expressed the importance of policies 
on patient involvement in ensuring “no decision about me, without me” 
becomes a reality. These policies will include work on embedding care 
planning, shared decision-making and providing information and support 
necessary to enable people to manage their own condition, where they wish to 
do so. 

Helping those with Long-Term Conditions  

5.11 Having heard the vital role of personalised care planning, we are consulting on 
introducing a pledge on care planning into the NHS Constitution: "to involve 
you in discussions about planning your care and to offer you a written record of 
what is agreed if you want one (pledge)". 

 “We further welcome the use of personalised care plans being incorporated into 
QIPP. We hope that this will see much more widespread use of personalised

care plans, and as such see many more patients fully involved in decisions 
about their care.” [The Patients Association] 

5.12 This commitment is echoed in the Mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board, 
which the Board will be held to account for delivering. The Mandate states: 
“everyone with long-term conditions, including people with mental health 
problems, will be offered a personalised care plan that reflects their 
preferences.”  

5.13 We continue to support the use of telehealth and telecare to support those with 
long-term conditions. This underpins delivery of our 3millionlives initiative. We 
have also delivered on our commitment to publish an updated Long-Term 
Conditions Compendium of Information. It brings together the information and 
evidence to reinforce to health and social care professionals, as well as 
commissioners, why a focus on long-term conditions should continue to be a 
priority. 

5.14 There is also the Government commitment to roll out personal health budgets 
more widely, subject to the results of the evaluation that is due this autumn. 
Subject to the evaluation, all people (including children) receiving NHS 
Continuing Healthcare will have the right to ask for a personal health budget by 
April 2014. Clinical commissioning groups will also be able to offer them more 
widely on a voluntary basis. 

Healthwatch 

5.15 Healthwatch England started on 1st October 2012 and local Healthwatch will 
start on 1st April 2013.  

5.16 Healthwatch England is a national body that enables the views of the people 
who use (or may use) NHS and social care services to influence national policy, 
advice and guidance. The views of the public, patients and service users will, 
through Healthwatch, form part of the advice to the Secretary of State, the NHS 
Commissioning Board, Monitor and the English local authorities, all of whom 
must have regard to that advice.  

5.17 In addition, local Healthwatch will give citizens and communities a stronger 
voice to influence and challenge how health and social care services are 
commissioned and provided in their local area. As well as championing 
patients’ and users’ views and experiences, local Healthwatch will  signpost 
people to information to help them make choices and ensure people know where 
to go for help, advice and, if necessary, expert support when things go wrong.

Shared Decision-Making programme 

5.18 The Right Care Shared Decision Making Programme34 is run as part of the 
QIPP programme, hosted by the East of England SHA. The programme works 
to embed the practice of shared decision making among patients and the wider 
public and among health professionals and their educators.  

5.19 The programme is working to establish shared decision-making as a part of 
education and training resources for healthcare staff and commissioners. It is 
also providing training and other resources for advocates within the voluntary 
sector to raise awareness amongst and promote demand from patients, their 
family and carers. Another workstream includes developing 36 patient decision 
aids to help patients understand and consider the pros and cons of possible 
treatment options. These will also encourage communication between patients 
and  their healthcare professionals. 

Care and support 

5.20 Caring for our future, the Government's White Paper for care and support, set 
out the ambition to reform adult social care and transform people’s experience 
of care and support.  Central to this vision is the need to put people in control of 
their own care, including the public money available to them and provide them 
with the ability to choose how their needs should be met.  The White Paper 
focuses on personalising care and support so that it is built around the needs, 
goals and outcomes of people, not around institutions.  

5.21 The draft Care and Support Bill continues this focus to embed personalisation in 
legislation.  The draft Bill enshrines new legal principles to promote the 
person's well-being, including the control they have over their day-to-day life 
and the care and support they receive.  It also creates a new entitlement to a care 
and support plan (or a support plan, in the case of a carer), and places clear 
duties on local authorities to help the adult decide how they want their needs to 
be met, so that they are at the heart of the planning process.  

5.22 The care and support plan will also include, as a standard element, the adult’s 
personal budget, which is created in law for the first time.  This new entitlement 
to a personal budget will be a key factor in empowering people to take more 
control over how their care and support is provided, by giving them knowledge 
of the money available to meet their needs.  The personal budget will be linked 
to existing rights to take a direct payment from the local authority to access that 
money, where the person chooses.

Delivering patient choice 

5.23 We are committed to expanding the offer of patient choice as part of making 
“no decision about me, without me” the norm in the NHS. 

The NHS Constitution 

5.24 Patients are currently entitled to choice and information to support their choices 
as set out in the NHS Constitution. As we outlined earlier, we will be extending 
the scope of this offer to include, for the first time, the right to choose the 
named consultant-led team that you see and the professionally led team that you 
see for secondary care mental health services for your first outpatient 
appointment. We intend to update the Handbook to the NHS Constitution to 
reflect these additional rights to choice.  

Monitor and section 75 regulations 

5.25 All patients must be able to exercise their rights to make choices in primary and 
elective care, as set out in the NHS Constitution. These are national rights and 
patients should be able exercise them wherever they live in England. 

5.26 The Department of Health is currently consulting on proposals to establish 
regulations that would include requirements to safeguard patients’ rights to 
exercise choice. The regulations would prohibit commissioners from reaching 
agreements or taking any other actions that would be inconsistent with a 
patient’s right to exercise choice as set out in the NHS Constitution. 

5.27 Monitor, the sector regulator with a main duty to protect and promote the 
interests of patients, would oversee the regulations. This means that, in future, 
Monitor would be able to consider complaints that a commissioner has taken 
action that is inconsistent with a patient’s right to choose. Monitor will have 
powers to investigate and powers to direct commissioners to change their 
approach if they have breached the regulations. 

NHS Standard Contract 

5.28 Placing requirements on providers would be a key mechanism in embedding 
choice in the NHS. Requirements could include instruction to: 

 

29 
 



 

i. list all services eligible for patient choice on the Choose and Book system; 

ii. list services against a lead healthcare professional (e.g. consultant) as and  

 where appropriate, including on Choose and Book; 

iii. accept all clinically appropriate referrals made through Choose and Book; 

iv. publish the information needed to support these choices; and 

v. work together with commissioners to ensure that service users are not 
delayed or inconvenienced by insufficient appointment slots being made 
available to Choose and Book. 

5.29 It will be for the NHS Commissioning Board to consider how these factors 
might be reflected in its planning guidance, including any impact on the 
standard contract, both of which will be published following its receipt of the 
Government’s mandate. 

The Choice Framework 

5.30 The Department of Health’s Choice Framework for NHS funded care and 
treatment in England published alongside this consultation response, brings 
together, for the first time, the choices available to patients all along the care 
pathway. This supports the Government’s Open Public Services agenda, which 
aims to ensure that everyone has access to the best possible public services.  

5.31 The NHS Choice Framework sets out clear expectations for the NHS 
Commissioning Board and commissioners about the choices patients ought to 
be able to make, and ensures that patients have clarity over what choices they 
can reasonably expect to have about where they go and who they see for 
treatment.  

5.32 The Framework summarises the outcome of the consultation process on the 
proposals to make “no decision about me, without me” through increasing 
patient choice. It sets out what choices people can expect to have in the 
following areas: 

• Choosing your GP practice 

• Choosing where to go for your first appointment as an outpatient 

• Choosing which consultant will be in charge of your treatment 

30 
 



 

• Choosing asking to change hospital if you have to wait longer than the     
maximum waiting times (18 weeks and two weeks to see a specialist for 
cancer) 

• Choosing who carries out a specialist test if you need one 

• Choosing maternity services 

• Choosing services provided in the community 

• Choosing to take part in health research 

5.33 The Choice Framework outlines the choices you can expect to have in the areas 
listed above, who to contact about that choice and how to complain if you don’t 
think the choice has been offered.  The Choice Framework can be found on the 
Department of Health’s website and on gov.uk. 

5.34 In addition to the choices set out in the Framework, the consultation also set out 
our expectation that self-referral will be available where there are benefits to 
patients of having it. It is for local commissioning organisations to make their 
own decisions about this route of access where it is clinically appropriate and of 
value to the healthcare system and local community. 

5.35 Many respondents were also positive that choice of treatment was a key part of 
making shared decision-making a reality in the NHS. All patients who wish to 
be involved in decisions and choices about their treatment and management of 
their condition should receive the relevant information and professional support 
to do so.  

5.36 We also remain committed to establishing a national choice offer for people and 
their families to be able to choose to die at home, including care homes. For this 
to be a realistic offer, we need to be confident that the right services are in place 
to provide the support that they may need. Implementation of the End of Life 
Care Strategy35 will be reviewed in 2013 to assess the feasibility and timescale 
for introducing this right. 

No decision about me, without me 

5.37 The role of the NHS Commissioning Board is key in delivering the vision of 
“no decision about me, without me”. To make this a reality in the NHS, we 
expect that the following become routine: 

35http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/category/policy-areas/social-care/end-of-life/ 
 

31 
 

                                                 

http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/category/policy-areas/social-care/end-of-life/


 

I. Patient involvement: 

• Shared decision-making: involving the patient and their carers in 
decisions about their care and treatment. 

• Self-care: the patient being supported in taking more responsibility for the 
things that they can do to maintain and improve their health. 

• Care planning: the patient jointly agreeing with the clinician a plan for 
their care, including as appropriate advanced planning for terminal care. 

II. Patient Choice: the ability for patients to choose the provider of their care, 
when and where it takes place, and who provides it.  

5.38 Together the set of policies being put forward add up to significantly more 
control for patients, putting them first and making real the idea of “no decision 
about me, without me”.
