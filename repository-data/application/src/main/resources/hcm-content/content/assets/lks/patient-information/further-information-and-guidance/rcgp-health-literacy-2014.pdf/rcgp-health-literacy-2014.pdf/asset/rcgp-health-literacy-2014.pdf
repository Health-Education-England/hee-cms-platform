Foreword

I would like to congratulate the authors and 
collaborators of this report, headed by our 
clinical lead Dr Gill Rowlands, in profiling the 
important concepts around health literacy. As 
a working GP I recognise and understand the 
need to provide meaningful information to my 
patients in managing their conditions. However, 
this report highlights the fact that many people 
engaging both across primary and secondary 
care may simply not have the assumed 
levels of healthcare literacy that empowers 

them to manage their conditions. Through 
undergraduate and postgraduate education and 
training around healthcare literacy we can hope 
that present and future healthcare professionals 
will understand the importance and relevance of 
health literacy. My hope is that this report serves 
as a catalyst for change.

Health Literacy

Executive summary

Health literacy skills are ‘the cognitive and 
social skills which determine the motivation 
and ability of individuals to gain access to, 
understand, and use information in ways which 
promote and maintain good health’.1 In view of 
the importance of health literacy to patients and 
the NHS, NHS England sponsored a meeting, 
hosted by the Clinical Innovation and Research 
Centre (CIRC) of the Royal College of General 
Practitioners (RCGP) in collaboration with the 
Chair of the Health Literacy specialist group (a 
Special Interest Group of the Society of Academic 
Primary Care [SAPC]). The meeting was held in 
July 2013 and brought together key stakeholders 
(see Appendix I), which included NHS England, 
professional and patient advocacy groups. 
The aim was to facilitate discussion about the 
important principles around health literacy 
relevant to primary care.

Central to the discussion was a shared 
understanding of what is meant by the term 
‘health literacy’. Health literacy is needed for 
patients and the public to understand and act 
upon health information, to become active and 
equal partners in co-producing health, and to 
take control of their health to help to shape 
health environments and health services for 
themselves, their families and their communities.

In addition to learning about health literacy 
and its impact on patients, the public and the 
NHS, those present brought their perspectives 
and expertise to the discussions. Several themes 
emerged as follows.

1. Health literacy is central to ensure fairness 
and equity in the NHS, with high-quality 
services being delivered to all.

2. Health literacy is key to more effective use of 
resources, through increased understanding 
of how best to access and use health services, 
through confidence and skills to enable 
decision-making that is shared between 
doctors and patients, through to ensuring that 
patients take a full role in developing services 
that fit with the needs of local populations.

3. GPs have a central role in this through:

a. Improving communication skills, and 
tailoring information not only to clinical 
need but also to patient health literacy 

b. Working with NHS managers to develop 
health systems and environments 
accessible to all regardless of health 
literacy level

c. Supporting patients to develop health 
literacy skills, both in understanding 
and using health information, and in 
understanding their rights to clear, 
accessible information tailored not only to 
their clinical need but also to their health 
literacy

d. Acting as agents for change through their 
role as commissioners of health services.

4. NHS commissioners should engage with 
local community networks and advocates, 
including the lifelong learning community.

5. Tools to check the effectiveness of 
communication, and surveys to check patient 
satisfaction, could be widened to include 
communication and health literacy.

6. New initiatives must be targeted at those 
with the greatest need, including those with 
the lowest health literacy skills. One such 
initiative, the NHS drive for digital inclusion, 
may do much to increase access, information 



vi

Health Literacy

and health literacy skills among those with 
the greatest need.

7. The Information Standard is an independent 
certification scheme that is commissioned by 
NHS England for all organisations producing 
evidence-based health and care information 
for the public. Information Standard members 
can lead the way in developing excellence in 
health information accessible to all, regardless 
of health literacy level.

8. The RCGP has a role in highlighting the 
importance of health literacy among its 
members, and to work with those who are 
leading GP undergraduate and postgraduate 
training to ensure that this takes place.

9. NHS England has a role to highlight 
the importance of health literacy to 
commissioners and NHS Trusts.

The meeting ended with calls for action, as 
follows.

1. That the important discussions and themes 
arising from the workshop continue to be 
explored and developed.

2. That the RCGP and NHS England consider 
working together to develop a five-year plan 
of action to address the challenges brought 
through low health literacy, focusing on the 
themes identified in the workshop.

Health Literacy

Introduction

Health literacy skills are ‘the cognitive and 
social skills which determine the motivation 
and ability of individuals to gain access to, 
understand, and use information in ways which 
promote and maintain good health’.1 In view of 
the importance of health literacy to patients and 
the NHS, NHS England sponsored a meeting, 
hosted by CIRC in collaboration with the Chair 
of the Health Literacy specialist group (a Special 
Interest Group of the SAPC). 

Tim Kelsey, National Director for Patients for 
NHS England, noted the following points.

• The 1948 health service was set up to 
deliver a high standard of care for all. 
Sixty-five years later it is not doing so; 
there are high variations in health care 
and health outcomes.

• NHS funding is becoming critical; it is 
estimated there will be a funding gap of 
£30 billion by 2020.

• Through giving people more control over 
their own health, the aim is to find new 
ways to engage and listen to communities 
and health services, which is fundamental 
to controlling the sustainability of the 
health service.

• At the core of this is health literacy as a 
way to help and support people to make 
use of information.

He noted too that:

[t]here is more health information 
being produced all the time, and we are 
learning to be [health] literate as a nation; 
it is important to ensure that no one is 
left behind. NHS Choices is about to be 
re-launched as a marketplace for services 
and tools. The NHS is an engine of social 
justice and we must make health literacy 
real in our society. NHS England has 
found £1 million to take 100,000 people 
through basic digital training. We will 
have to move quickly and there is much 
to do, but this is a good start.

Clare Gerada, the Immediate past Chair of RCGP 
Council, noted that:

this is very exciting looking forward 
and in future the NHS will have to try 
to engage the public in an equal way 
with regards to their health. It must be 
questioned how you can have shared 
decision-making if patients don’t 
understand the language you are using. 
GPs come across health inequalities every 
day. Unless they support the patients to 
improve their health literacy, how can 
they further engage patients?

Health Literacy

1 Literature background

Health is complex and requires both motivation 
and skills. There are increasing demands on the 
public to promote their health and wellbeing, 
and on patients to be able to understand and 
manage their health and engage in shaping local 
health services.2 A health literacy skills set is 
essential. Doctors need good communication 
skills too in order to share complex information 
in a clear and manageable way, and to tailor 
information to patient skills as well as clinical 
need. This specifically applies to GPs’ provision 
of information, which can include the nature of 
a diagnosis, the risks and benefits of different 
treatments, and how to take medications in 
a safe and effective way. A key role for GPs 
is to support patients to develop the health 
literacy knowledge and confidence to improve 
their own health. Health literacy skills extend 
beyond consultation, as patients need to know 
how to access, understand and make use of 
health services in ways that can promote and 
maintain good health, to gather, evaluate and use 
information for health from a range of sources, 
both within and outside the NHS, and to become 
meaningfully involved with the development of 
local NHS services.

Health literacy is an important determinant of 
health. People can be well educated and even 
very literate and have low health literacy, but 
low health literacy is most common in people 

with low basic skills. Recent surveys in the UK 
show that the percentage of adults below the 
literacy level expected at the end of full-time 
compulsory education (16 years) is 43%; for 
numeracy the percentage below the expected 
level at the end of compulsory education is 
78%.3 This is reflected in the levels of health 
literacy. Forty-three per cent of the English adult 
working-age population cannot fully understand 
and use health information containing only 
text. When numerical information is included in 
health information, this proportion increases to 
61%.4

Written health literature and doctors’ spoken 
communication are often not pitched at a level 
that is inclusive of people with low health 
literacy. Some of the greatest problems arise from 
the mismatch between what health institutions 
demand and expect from patients (by what they 
produce in print, in oral exchanges, online and 
in the physical environment) and the skills of the 
patients and families they are intended to serve. 
Making services more responsive to patients is a 
core focus of UK health policy.

Doctors have a responsibility to communicate in 
a way that takes account of the diverse levels of 
health literacy of their patients, enabling people 
to make informed choices about their own health.

2 Health literacy

 An overview
 Dr Gill Rowlands

Health literacy can be divided into three levels: 
functional, interactive and critical. GPs are key, 
as 90% of all encounters in the NHS are in 

general practice. GPs have an important role in 
supporting patients to develop their skills and 
also have a powerful role in commissioning.

Functional health literacy

These are the basic skills of reading, discussing 
and understanding text, and being able to do 
numerical calculations. One way of measuring 
this is to give people a test (measuring absolute 
levels of functional health literacy). There are 
multiple measures, which range in complexity 
and time. When understanding the relevance of 
health materials for patients, one important thing 
to understand is the gap between the complexity 
of the health information and the skills of those 
for whom the information is written (relative 
heath literacy). Regarding absolute levels of 
functional health literacy, results vary as per the 
measures used. For example, in the US 46% of 
people operating within the lowest two levels 
would experience significant problems. With 
regard to relative levels of functional health 
literacy, health materials containing only text 
are too complex for 43% of England’s working-
age population to be able to understand and 
use; for materials containing both text (literacy) 
and numeracy, 61% of England’s working-age 
population find the material too complex.4

There is significant regional variation. There is a 
north/south divide, with London as an island of 
deprivation in the south of England. However, 
low health literacy is a problem for everyone; 
even in the least deprived areas there is still a 
significant proportion of the population who 

cannot understand health materials. Those 
facing the biggest barriers are older people, black 
and ethnic minority groups, those with low 
qualifications, those without English as a first 
language, those with low job status and those in 
the poverty trap.4

An exploratory analysis of how health literacy 
skills relate to information communication 
technology (ICT) skills as measured in the most 
recent English National Skills Survey (the Skills 
for Life Survey [SfL] 2011) found a marked 
overlap.3 For example, for word processing, the 
study compared people below and above the 
health literacy threshold. Those who failed the 
word-processing skills test were significantly 
more likely to be below the threshold. The same 
was found when the group tested emailing and 
spreadsheet skills.5

Previous research indicates the impact of low 
health literacy on patients and the Health 
Service. Low functional health literacy is 
linked with more use of hospital services with 
higher in-patient and Accident and Emergency 
(A&E) Department use, and with lower rates 
of screening uptakes including mammography 
and flu vaccine.6 There are also higher levels of 
mortality in older people.6–8

Health Literacy

Interactive health literacy

This is about patients having the skills and 
confidence to discuss their illness and treatment 
with doctors or nurses, asking about other 

options or questioning why a particular 
treatment is right for them. This promotes shared 
decision-making.9

Critical health literacy

This is about people trying to take control of the 
wider determinants of their health, for example 
having the skills to take action if they identify 
barriers to health in their environment such as 
not enough access to fresh fruit and vegetables 
or not enough open spaces for exercise.9 With 

critical health literacy, the balance of power 
transfers to patients and the public.10 We have to 
move to this model; it might be uncomfortable 
for healthcare professionals (HCPs) but it takes 
patient self-determination and control to a 
different level.

3 What challenges does health literacy bring?

Health literacy is important. We know it affects 
health, so it is reasonable to assume it affects 
wellbeing too. It is a common problem that 
affects half of the population and is complex 
and influenced by all areas of life. We have to 
make sure we develop a range of solutions for 
individuals and families. We know communities 
have knowledge about their environments. 
GPs add to this by providing an environment 
for people to develop health literacy in a safe 

space. Health service managers can ensure 
information is written in the right way. Health 
service commissioners are agents for change. The 
Information Standard (p. 14) is a powerful tool 
for ensuring that high-quality health information 
incorporates health literacy.

The issues brought about through low health 
literacy affect patients, HCPs, managers and 
commissioners of health services.

Challenges for patients

• Understanding and using the wide range 
of information relevant to health, which is 
written at varying literacy and numeracy 
levels, without being patronised.

• Difficulty assessing accuracy and 
provenance of health information.

• Understanding medical terms and language.

• Developing the language and skills to 
challenge and explore doctors’ suggestions 
for treatment.

• Developing the language and skills to 
manage their own health within the context 
of their lives, including work, family and 
community.

Comments from the workshop members

‘It is a wonderful idea to improve 
communication with patients. It is difficult 
when we look at it from a health inequalities 
and health information perspective. The gap 
here is in danger of widening. It is necessary to 
commission at patient and population level to 
ensure that those at the bottom don’t fall behind.’

‘Many people I look after cannot read. If we are 
moving to a digital platform the people who 
cannot read or write may be able to come back in.’

Challenges for doctors and other healthcare professionals

• Different styles and levels of communication 
are needed for people with low health 
literacy and those with very high health 
literacy.

• Current healthcare environments do not 
recognise the needs of people with varied 
levels of health literacy.

• There is frequently a tension between use 
of complex medical terminology and more 
everyday common-sense language.

• There is an absence of acknowledgement and 
support for people with low health literacy.

• HCPs, including doctors, need to be able to 
assess, recognise, support and improve the 



6

Health Literacy

health literacy of people as an integrated 
part of clinical practice and prioritise those 
most in need (for example those with 

language barriers or multi-morbidity). 
HCPs need to measure change by feedback.

Challenges for managers

• Developing streamlined ‘health literate’ 
services accessible to all regardless of health 
literacy level.

• Ensuring ‘health literacy awareness’ of all 
staff.

• Ensuring health literacy training for 
frontline clinical staff and others with face-
to-face patient contact.

Challenges for commissioners

• Enabling meaningful engagement of people 
at all health literacy levels.

The group felt that this is about support from 
organisations with strong trust relationships 
in communities. This needs to be resourced 
and commissioned. Also, the NHS needs to 
commission personalised services. Research 
should be used to build or support a compelling 
narrative.

The group talked about the commissioning 
environment; there are big challenges but there 
is sufficient funding to start making a difference. 
It would be necessary to follow the money. This 
will not happen overnight, and would most 
likely entail a five-year programme of work. 
It is important not to tell commissioners to do 
this, but to present it as a solution to an existing 
problem. The NHS needs to understand the 
value of advocates, and there is evidence that 
this works. When communicating with patients 
and the public, short slogans are linked to 
positive outcomes.

The Year of Care planning model (http://
healthandcare.dh.gov.uk/year-of-care/) mentions 
many of these aspects. The Year of Care model 
from the Chronic Care model is helpful in 
putting it all together.

The EU Health Literacy Survey

A good study measuring interactive and critical 
health literacy is the EU Health Literacy Survey.11 
This study developed a conceptual framework 
and then a matrix to measure perceived ability 
to access, understand, appraise and apply 
health information across the three domains 
of health care, disease prevention and health 
promotion. Eight countries (unfortunately not 
including the UK) took part in this survey. This 
replicates the functional health literacy findings 
in England. People with low literacy skills make 
more use of hospital services and are less likely 
to get involved in preventive activity. They are 
also more likely to die at a younger age. It is 
interesting that the problem is worse in countries 
with the most poverty.

Health Literacy

4 The importance of communication

Health literacy relates to more than just reading 
and writing (or ‘general literacy’). It also includes 
the ability to access, understand and act upon 
health information and services12 as well as 
wider issues of motivation1 and the ability to 
take control of environmental and social factors 
influencing health.9 Not everybody has had the 
opportunity to study biology or basic science. 
Many people have minimal knowledge of health 
conditions or how their own bodies work. 
Doctors, having spent many years immersed 
in the biology of human health and disease, 
may overestimate the health literacy of their 

patients.13 Several researchers have found that 
doctors do not adjust their communication when 
seeing patients with varying levels of health 
literacy, and they may fail to realise that they 
have not made themselves understood.14

Good diabetes self-care includes patients 
regularly monitoring their own blood glucose 
levels to keep them within a narrow range. Yet, 
patients with diabetes may struggle to make 
sense of this unless they know that it is part 
of normal biology for blood to contain some 
glucose.

Misconceptions and misunderstandings

Patients with limited literacy may feel 
embarrassed by their lack of understanding 
or poor reading skills, which can stop them 
asking for clarification or looking for alternative 
sources of information.15 This mismatch 
in communication is an important factor 
contributing to poor health. 

Doctors may use familiar words in unfamiliar 
ways. For example, when health practitioners 
use the term ‘chronic’ they frequently mean 
‘persistent’, whereas a common alternative 
understanding of the word is to mean ‘severe’.16 
Doctors can unintentionally use words that are 
unfamiliar to their patients, without realising 
that the meaning is not clear. Some concepts 
familiar and obvious to doctors may be alien to 
patients.

Doctors often supplement brief spoken 
information during the consultation with leaflets 
and booklets, assuming they can be understood. 

People with poor health literacy will struggle to 
make use of written health information, which 
often requires a level of literacy that many 
patients do not have.4 Increasingly, patients 
are sent copies of clinic letters; they struggle 
to understand these and this may be a source 
of frustration and confusion. More and more, 
the internet is a source of health information. 
ICT skills are moderately correlated with both 
literacy and numeracy skills, thus those with 
low literacy and numeracy skills, and health 
literacy skills, are also likely to have low ICT 
skills.3,6 Furthermore, those with low health 
literacy skills will also have the least access to 
sources of information, including the internet.4 
New initiatives to increase patient understanding 
of, and control over, their health and health care, 
such as access to medical records, may also be 
less accessible to those with low health literacy 
skills, arguably one of the groups with the most 
to gain from such access.



8

Health Literacy

Patients typically retain around half of the 
information they receive in a consultation, and 

only half of what they do retain is generally 
correct.17

Treatment errors

Low health literacy can prevent people 
understanding the diagnosis they have been 
given. It can also lead to treatment errors. Adults 
with low levels of literacy have increased rates 
of misunderstanding medication instructions.18 
All medication in the UK is clearly labelled and a 

patient information leaflet is included in the box. 
Low health literacy prevents many people from 
being able to interpret this information and this 
inhibits understanding of medication warnings 
and precautions.

Shared decision-making

When decisions are made jointly between 
doctors and patients, this can lead to improved 
health outcomes, higher levels of patient 
satisfaction and more effective use of resources.12 
Low health literacy is a barrier to participating 

in shared decision-making. This includes the 
process of informed consent for medical and 
surgical procedures. Patients must be given 
enough time and understandable information to 
fully appreciate the implications of their consent.



9

Health Literacy

5 Low health literacy and health

Poor health literacy has substantial health 
consequences: people with low health literacy 
report worse physical and mental health, 
which is supported by a higher prevalence of a 
number of serious health conditions, including 
diabetes and heart failure.6 These individuals 
have less adequate health knowledge, access 
fewer preventive services and have poorer 
self-management skills. Repeated studies have 
shown that those with low health literacy are 
more likely to access emergency services or to be 
admitted to hospital, and have a reduced quality 
of life.6 Studies also suggest an increased risk of 

dying for older people with low health literacy, 
compared with their more health-literate peers.7,8 
This link remains even after other factors, such as 
poverty, are taken into account. 

Personal communication from a physician

One patient with arthritis came in to hospital 
unable to move due to swollen joints. It turned 
out that her appointment four months ago 
had been cancelled but she hadn’t known how 
to get help, and so had simply lived with her 
deteriorating symptoms.



10

Health Literacy

6 The health literacy environment

Health literacy is an important determinant 
of access to health care. Doctors instinctively 
know how to navigate themselves and their 
families through health services. People with 
low health literacy may struggle to book or 
cancel appointments. They may be unsure of 
how to respond to an adverse reaction to their 
medication. Many patients with long-term 
conditions do not know what to do if their health 
deteriorates between planned consultations. 
Even working out how to get to the right place 
in a health facility requires a degree of health 
literacy.

GPs undertake 90% of face-to-face medical 
consultations in the NHS and are thus in an 
excellent position to work with patients and 
patient advocates to design systems that are 
more accessible to people with low health 
literacy. As people who regularly meet patients, 
they are in a position to identify barriers 
in the system and work to develop health 
environments that facilitate better access.

Personal communication from a GP

A patient referred for a chest X-ray didn’t have it 
done because he walked round the hospital and 
couldn’t find the department because the sign 
read ‘Radiology’. He was too embarrassed to ask 
for directions.

Health service managers can play a key role in 
developing ‘health literate’ environments. This 
can include a health literacy risk assessment of 
all information and materials given to patients, 
and clear signage avoiding jargon and using 
lay terms whenever possible, for example ‘heart 
section’ rather than ‘cardiology department’. All 
staff should be made aware of health literacy 
and the challenges it can bring; all staff with 
patient contact (clinical and non-clinical) should 
have regular health literacy training. There are 
well-developed and tested tools available to help 
managers develop health-literate services,19 and 
managers should be encouraged to use these.

Finally, patient assessment of services is 
increasing;20 managers should consider adding 
some simple questions to patient feedback 
surveys to assess patient views on the clarity, or 
otherwise, of hospital and GP surgery systems 
and information. Including patient experts and 
patient advocates in the design of the systems 
that are more accessible, including design of 
buildings and signage in new NHS premises, 
will help the NHS to provide services accessible 
to all regardless of their health literacy skills.



11

Health Literacy

7 Good practice

There are several concrete steps that doctors 
can take to improve communications with all 
patients, regardless of health literacy level. 
Speaking slowly, avoiding jargon and repeating 
points all improve comprehension. Doctors 
should encourage and expect all patients to 
ask questions using techniques such as those 
identified in the ‘Ask me 3’ patient education 
programme.21

Doctors should first establish what the patient 
knows and understands before launching into 
a discussion that begins at a level either too 
complex or too simple for the patient.

To check understanding and recall of the 
consultation, doctors should ask for patients 
to repeat back critical information in their own 
words. Using this technique, known as ‘teach 
back’, will clearly establish whether the patient 
has understood the consultation.22 When doing 
this, doctors should emphasise that what they 
are checking is their own ability to communicate, 
not the patient’s ability to understand. By closing 
the communication loop in this way, doctors can 
identify which explanations and communication 
gaps are most often understood by patients. 

This is particularly important when doctors are 
meeting patients for the first time. Repeating 
information in this way also reinforces it in 
patients’ minds.

Doctors can also reduce the impact of low 
health literacy by communicating in ways 
other than speech and printed material. Some 
concepts are better conveyed visually. Almost 
every consulting room has a computer screen, 
and graphics and multimedia can be used to 
supplement more conventional illustrations and 
three-dimensional models.

Doctors should apply a ‘universal precautions’ 
approach to communication (that is, 
communicate clearly and without jargon for all 
patients) and not only when health literacy is 
obviously low. It is important to give patients 
clear opportunities to return with further 
questions, either written or verbal, at a later date. 
Patients who are well spoken and educated may 
also have low health literacy and this may be 
exacerbated by the stress of being unwell. By 
consistently practising good communication, 
doctors can improve care for all their patients.

Comments from the workshop members

• ‘Regarding functional literacy, there 
are huge barriers for someone with 
learning disabilities. Bringing people to 
the information may not be realistic. The 
information may need to change.’

• ‘There is much to learn from the learning 
disabilities field. They have done great work 
on simplifying information to date (e.g. 
Books Beyond Words). In the short term we 
have to simplify the way we do things and 
need to learn from colleagues. Information 
should be tailored appropriately for the 
group that needs to access it. We need to 
raise the skills of the population at the same 
time as simplifying information, but one 
size will not fit all.’

• ‘The point [of Books Beyond Words] is to 
allow people to tell their own story rather 
than to tell our story. The most important 
thing is to establish reciprocity and learn 
from people about their circumstances.’

• ‘Whether or not people trust [their GP] 
influences understanding. We will have 
to understand health literacy in a more 
complex way.’

• ‘The challenge is how to make the sum of 
the solutions greater than the individual 
parts. Any work moving forward should 
look at bringing the disparate strands 
together. Having something measurable is 
very important.’

• ‘We need real actions to take forward from 
today. There is huge momentum and it is 
our responsibility to ensure it delivers real, 
hard outcomes.’

‘Ask me 3’ is a technique for patients to use 
when dealing with health professionals. By 
asking these three questions, they can improve 
communications with their doctor:

• What is my main problem?

• What do I need to do?

• Why is it important for me to do this?1

8 Interactive and critical health literacy

Almost all research to date has focused on 
literacy and numeracy skills in the health setting, 
that is, functional health literacy.9 However, 
the expanded definition used in the UK 
includes wider and higher-level cognitive skills. 
Interactive health literacy skills are those that 
enable people to ‘actively participate in everyday 
(health) activities, to extract information and 
derive meaning from different forms of (health) 
communication, and apply new information 
to changing circumstances’, while the highest-
level skills (‘critical’ health literacy skills) enable 
people to ‘critically analyse information and use 
this information to exert greater control over life 
events and situations’.9 These higher-level health 
literacy skills will be required to enable patients 
and the public to promote health and wellbeing, 
protect their health through involvement in 
illness prevention (for example, involvement in 
disease screening and understanding of personal 
and public safety), and manage any illnesses 
they may develop.

The NHS, like all health services, is having to 
provide more health care to more people within 
limited resources;23 the only sustainable way for 
this to happen is for increased health promotion 
and patient self-care.24,25 The latest NHS 
reorganisation is placing an emphasis on patient 
involvement in shaping local services, with ‘no 
decision about me without me’.2 An appropriate 
and effective way to take these agendas forward 
is to build interactive and critical health literacy 
skills in the population. Teaching such skills 
is complex, but lifelong learning initiatives for 
individuals and families are showing promising 
results.26,27 The recent movement of public health 
from the NHS into local authorities28 brings 
many opportunities for closer working between 
the NHS, public health, education and social 
care, including collaborative projects to build 
patient and public health literacy skills.

9 The Information Standard

The Information Standard is a certification 
scheme for organisations producing evidence-
based health and care information for the public. 
Any organisation achieving the Information 
Standard has undergone a rigorous assessment 
to check that the information it produces is 
clear, accurate, balanced, evidence-based and 
up-to-date.29 Information Standard-accredited 
organisations should be writing at a level that’s 
appropriate for the population. Such approaches 

make systems clearer, reduce complexity and 
improve communications. The Information 
Standard is thus a powerful driver for change. A 
recent survey of Information Standard members29 
indicated that the majority of members had 
heard about health literacy but 20% had not. 
The majority already think they are producing 
information at the right level; 30% identified one 
or more barriers to accessing information; and 
70% wanted to learn more about health literacy.

10 Health literacy in practice

 Case study from the Terrence Higgins Trust
  Case study by Dominic Edwardes, Health Improvement and Marketing Director,  

Terrence Higgins Trust

The key thing about health literacy is that it 
involves the audience rather than the producer. 
We need to put the consumer at the centre. The 
issue with health literacy is people being able to 
use the information.

The fact that 43–61% of the population have low 
health literacy skills4 is surprising. Information is 
wasted if it isn’t produced in a way that people 
can understand and find useful. There are three 
key dimensions to health literacy: reading level, 
numeracy level and language barriers. We 
have to understand how people are accessing 
information. For example, at the Terrence 
Higgins Trust it is known that gay men like to 
use iPhones.

Can one size fit all? Yes and no. Using examples 
from the work of the Terrence Higgins Trust 
and looking at African audiences we know that 
stigma is huge in stopping people from accessing 
information on human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). Most people who have come to the UK 
think that they have left the problem of HIV 
behind them. These people also have a strong 
dislike of sexualised imagery and have lower 
levels of internet access.

To reach this audience the Terrence Higgins 
Trust created a healthy-lifestyle magazine, which 
includes information on HIV. This is proving 
successful and is in its tenth edition. There are 
also leaflets about testing, sexually transmitted 

diseases (STDs) and HIV. Looking at men who 
have sex with men, they are familiar with HIV 
messaging, tend to have higher partner change 
and love sexualised imagery. They have high 
levels of internet access and are known to be 
early adopters of technology. The Terrence 
Higgins Trust has created a condom campaign 
online that also encourages STD check-ups.

Messages can look different for different 
audiences. The Trust has now developed a 
message that looks broadly the same but that 
approaches both gay men and the African 
audience. Both groups are engaged with starting 
things. The campaign is ‘It starts with me’ and 
has slightly different approaches, but the same 
message for each group. For example, the use 
of condoms in the campaign resonates with 
the message of responsibility for the African 
audience and the message of better sex for men 
who have sex with men.

The mobile will overtake the desktop and it is 
important for the Trust to know that creating an 
app will reach its target audience for men who 
have sex with men. It is now possible to order a 
postal HIV test kit via your mobile.

What can GPs do? They can direct HIV sufferers 
to the Terrence Higgins Trust, they can look for 
materials produced by the Information Standard 
and they can promote NHS Choices.

11 The NHS England Digital Inclusion Strategy

Exploiting the power of the digital revolution 
to transform health care, and delivering 
interventions that address health inequalities, 
are leading objectives for NHS England. The 
NHS England Mandate30 made a commitment 
to operate at the forefront of new technologies. 
That Mandate states: ‘[t]he objective is to achieve 
a significant increase in the use of technology 
to help people to manage their own health and 
care’. At the same time there is a commitment to 
reducing health inequalities with an NHS ‘for 
everyone regardless of income, location, age, 
gender, ethnicity or any other characteristic’.30

However, these objectives can be difficult to 
reconcile. Those who make greatest use of health 
services, and those experiencing greatest health 
inequalities, are exactly those least likely to be 
online,17,31 or to have ICT skills.3

• Over 16 million people in the UK lack basic 
digital literacy skills.

• Over 7 million people in the UK have never 
used the internet.

• People over the age of 65 account for more 
than half of all NHS spending. However, 
40% of those aged 65 and over do not have 
access to the internet at home and 5 million 
of these have never been online.

• People with a disability are three times more 
likely to have never used the internet. Four 
million people with a disability have never 
been online.

• The homeless, offenders, the Gypsy 
and Traveller community and people 
in some rural communities experience 
health inequalities. These people are at an 
additional disadvantage because of the lack 

of internet access or broadband.

Furthermore there is a strong correlation 
between low levels of digital skills and low levels 
of health literacy.

• Those working-age (16–65 years) people in 
England have the least access to sources of 
health information, including the internet.4

The NHS England business plan32 has set out an 
ambitious programme of digital transformation 
including:

• giving citizens the knowledge, skills and 
confidence to manage their own health

• using modern techniques such as social and 
digital media to supplement other forms 
of insight, so that we hear views from all 
sections of society and understand what 
people are saying about the health services 
they want to receive

• making best use of digital channels to 
offer people more convenience, choice and 
control.

This transformation will not be delivered if 
the benefits are not available to the 7 million 
people who have not been online, the 16 million 
people who lack basic digital literacy skills, or 
the 21 million people with low health literacy 
and numeracy.4 Extending digital access and 
boosting digital literacy skills are central to NHS 
England’s approach to equality:

Equality lies at the heart of the NHS, its 
values, processes and behaviours. People 
have a right to high quality services, 
irrespective of who they are, where 



17

Health Literacy

they live, or what condition they have. 
There is clear evidence that people from 
disadvantaged communities are at greater 
risk of early death than the average 
population.32

People with the lowest health literacy, itself a risk 
factor for poorer health and higher mortality,8,9 
also have the least access to sources of health 
information, including the internet. This finding 
means that this extension of digital access and 
digital literacy skills will need to be specifically 
targeted at groups at higher risk of low health 
literacy.4

Recognising the importance of this challenge, 
the NHS England business plan32 includes the 
following commitment: ‘Reducing inequalities: 
100,000 citizens trained in basic online skills to 
boost health literacy (by April 2014).’

A programme of work has been designed to 
deliver:

• the establishment of a network of 
community hubs in deprived areas to 
provide training in online skills and assisted 
digital support in accessing online services

• the development of online training tools

• user testing of digital products and services 
with less digitally skilled users

• the building of the evidence base on 
digital literacy’s contribution to increased 
patient empowerment and reduced health 
inequalities.

The contract to deliver this Widening Digital 
Participation programme has been let to the 
leading digital inclusion and skills agency, the 
Tinder Foundation (www.tinderfoundation.org).

12 Summary of breakout group discussions

In considering issues around health literary, 
three breakout groups were set up. These groups 
considered the role of the GP and professionals, 
the role of the commissioner and the role of 
the patients and the public. A framework to 
consider any future work was defined: issues 

around specific outcomes, what will make the 
biggest difference, what we can expect to change 
and how this should be measured, when we 
can expect it to happen, key stakeholders, if 
extra training is needed, tools needed and a key 
research question in relation to their area.

GPs and healthcare professionals

In considering the role of GPs and professionals, 
the discussion was very rich. The group decided 
that the theme was to centralise the idea that 
HCPs need to be able to assess, recognise, 
support and improve the health literacy of 
people as an integrated part of clinical practice 
and prioritise those most in need (for example, 
those with language barriers or multi-morbidity). 
HCPs also need to measure change by feedback 
and checking patient understanding of key 
messages from the consultation, emphasising 

to the patient that what is being checked is the 
doctor’s ability to communicate well, rather 
than the patient’s ability to understand. Key 
stakeholders would include those responsible 
for under- and postgraduate training. Training 
will be needed to build in the idea of trust, 
compassion and reciprocity. Toolkits will be 
needed and the group talked about using videos 
and peer review. Research questions could be 
based around developing an assessment of 
consultations or be linked to effectiveness.

Health service commissioners

In considering the role of health service 
commissioners, the key themes that emerged 
included making information accessible and 
advocacy, with support leading to better health 
outcomes. Motivated and activated community 

networks were thought to be of importance, 
which would lead to trust. The challenge for 
commissioners is to equate the evidence to the 
benefits.

Patients and the public

In discussing the role of patients and the public, 
key themes and ideas included the development 
of test sites, extension of the friends and family 
test to include health literacy, the right to take 
an advocate with you, the amount of time 
allowed in a GP consultation, information 

provided before and after a consultation, role 
models, peers, role of data, and availability of 
tools to confirm patients’ awareness of options. 
Also of importance was making information 
accessible before and after the consultation, the 
value of role models, peers and patient leaders, 



19

Health Literacy

and availability of tools to confirm patients’ 
awareness and understanding of their healthcare 
options. The need for patients to be asked if they 
understand what is being presented to them 
was important and this highlights good practice. 
The idea is to develop a culture change with 
patients as active partners in care. There are clear 
research needs around assessing the impact and 

accessibility of different forms of information 
(leaflets, video, etc.), ascertaining whether 
people accessing lifelong learning to build health 
literacy skills feel more confident about talking 
to health professionals, and determining what 
percentage of people leaving the GP consultation 
or other settings understand options and 
information.

13 Conclusions and call for action 

Two key themes are described at the beginning 
of this report: the need for making more effective 
use of resources and the central role of GPs in 
accomplishing this by improving their own 
communication skills, and tailoring information 
to not only patient health literacy but also clinical 
need.

Health literacy is a complex, multifaceted 
concept, but one that has real impact on patients, 
doctors and the NHS. The problems brought by 
low health literacy are many, and affect all areas 
of health and health care. By working together 
to develop a five-year plan, building on the ideas 
of the key stakeholders present at the England 
seminar, the RCGP and NHS England can lead 
the way in addressing some of the important 
issues raised by health literacy, resulting in more 
effective, more patient-centred care in the NHS.

This report calls for action for GPs to play their 
part in addressing the issues raised by low health 
literacy in England. A five-year plan should be 
developed by the RCGP, in partnership with 
NHS England, to address the following areas.

1. To work with the Health Literacy Group UK 
to ensure that national health literacy policy 
recommendations include those arising from 
the July 2013 workshop and this report.

2. To influence GP training so that all GPs 
recognise the issues caused by low health 

literacy and learn to develop consultation 
techniques to improve the clarity of their 
communication with patients with low health 
literacy and support patients to develop their 
health literacy skills.

3. To develop recommendations for Clinical 
Commissioning Groups (CCGs) to consider 
health literacy approaches by NHS service 
providers when commissioning services.

4. To develop pilot sites where CCGs can 
commission health literacy training for 
patients from adult learning providers, with 
assessment of the impact of these pilots on 
patient skills, patient satisfaction with NHS 
services and their use of NHS services.

5. To ensure that those aspects of the Digital 
Inclusion Strategy relevant to general practice 
are highlighted to GPs.

6. NHS England in particular to work with the 
Information Standard to develop a health 
literacy guide to be circulated to all NHS 
Trusts.

We believe that the development and 
implementation of such a five-year plan could 
transform the landscape of health literacy in 
England through development of a health-
literate health system accessible to all, and 
empowered, health-literate patients can work 
with GPs and NHS England to shape the NHS 
that England needs.
