Making the Case for Evidence Based 
Patient Information: Final Report 
January 2019 

Background 
On behalf of Health Education England, a group of library and knowledge specialists across the NHS 

in England worked together on a shared project to explore how evidence is used in the creation of 

information for patients.   

Project group 
The project group consists of: 

• Emily Hopkins, Health Education England 

• Deena Maggs, The King’s Fund  

• Victoria Treadway, NHS RightCare 

• Vicki Veness, Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust 

• Jacqui Watkeys, Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust 

• Suzanne Wilson, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust 

The project sponsor is Ruth Carlyle, Head of Library & Knowledge Services and Technology Enhanced 

Learning, HEE Midlands and East. 

Contributions were also received from Liz Askew, Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust (Literature 

searching) and Nicholas Willsher, The King’s Fund (animation). 

The project ran from April 2018-January 2019.  

Why does patient information need to be evidence based?  
The need for patient information to be evidence based is driven by a number of strategic priorities 

including patient experience, self-management, shared decision-making and health system 

sustainability. Engaging patients and the public is a key priority at both national and local level 

throughout the NHS. Outlined in the Five Year Forward View, 2014 "we will do more to support 

people to manage their own health - staying healthy and making informed choice of treatment" and 

in recent guidance from NHS England (Involving people in their own health and care: statutory 

guidance for clinical commissioning groups and NHS England, 2017) it states that by involving 

“people in their health and care, [they] experience better quality care and improved health and 

wellbeing, and the system makes more efficient use of resources.” 

The Power of Information, the ten-year information strategy from the Department of Health 

(published in May 2012), outlines a framework for transforming information within the NHS. 

In the context of libraries, the ‘Knowledge for healthcare framework for NHS library and knowledge 
services in England 2015-2020', sets out the role of NHS libraries, it highlights using “the expertise of 



 

4 
 

their staff to ensure that NHS bodies, staff, learners, patients and the public have the right 
knowledge and evidence, when and where they need it." 
 

Aims  
1. To influence and advocate the importance of evidence for health information for patients, 

carers and the public in healthcare settings. 

2. To reflect on how to influence key stakeholders and develop a set of case studies and notes 

which will support others to achieve this within their local NHS settings. 

 Objectives 
1. To undertake a review of the evidence on evidence for health information (literature and 

learning from networks). 

2. To undertake a mapping exercise to produce a snapshot of existing processes and policies 

around the production of health information in three local NHS Trusts. 

3. To conduct an "influencing exercise" within local NHS Trusts to explore the feasibility of 

librarians and knowledge specialists becoming embedded in the production of health 

information. 

4. To produce outputs that "make the case" for evidence based health information that will be 

used by local library and knowledge services to advocate for the use of evidence in health 

information for patients, carers and the public, as a core strand in delivering Knowledge for 

Healthcare. 

5. To produce a final report on the learning and successes achieved during the project. 

Expected benefits 
The expected benefits of the project are that: 

• Evidence based health information will result in well-informed and empowered patients, 

carers and members of the public. 

• Increased awareness amongst stakeholders regarding the expertise and role of librarians 

and knowledge specialists in the production of health information.

1: The evidence base – what is known?    
An evidence review was undertaken to understand what is already known about evidence based 

health information.  In addition, areas of good practice and experiential learning were captured via 

professional contacts in library networks from across the UK. 

The literature   
A review of the literature highlighted that while the need for patient information is acknowledged, 

the quality of patient information across NHS organisations is variable.  

Organisations working to influence high quality patient information, such as the Patient Information 

Forum (PiF) have published a number of resources to support health care professionals and 

organisations to produce evidence based health information.  A 2014 PiF report summarises the 

literature and makes a compelling case for high quality, evidence based patient information and its 

contribution to a wide range of healthcare priorities:  

• It has a positive impact on service utilisation and health costs, patients’ experience of 

healthcare and patients’ health behaviour and status. 

• It “unlocks” patient engagement, which is vital to help people manage their health, make 

informed decisions about their healthcare, and mitigate financial pressure on the health 

service. 

• It makes good business sense: There are positive impacts on service use and costs, 

substantial capacity savings, significant returns on investment by increasing the self-

management of long-term conditions and attracting customers.  

• High quality patient information is necessary to enhance the patient experience; a key driver 

for NHS Trust boards and senior leaders.  

• Actively involving people in decisions about their healthcare helps to reduce unwarranted 

variations in treatment.  

A 2017 review article (Sustersic, 2017) highlights the role of well written and timely patient 

information leaflets in improving patient knowledge and satisfaction and inducing better 

adherence to treatment. However, it also acknowledges huge variation in the quality, 

appropriate use and effective evaluation of patient information.   

Primary studies highlight additional benefits to the production of high quality patient 

information: 

• It empowers patients and families and supports them to make evidence based decisions 

about their care (Wegwarth). 

• It reduces unnecessary interventions including antibiotic prescribing and repeat GP 

consultations (de Bont, 2015). 

It is also important to note that “high quality” information does not always specifically and explicitly 

mention the evidence base. Although this is implied, the link between quoting clinical evidence and 

making a leaflet understandable is sometimes not made in patient information policies.

Learning and reflections from library networks  
Contact was made with library and knowledge service colleagues in England involved in patient 

information projects / roles.  The aim was to capture learning and know-how around the issues and 

challenges facing library professionals trying to influence evidence based patient information.  The 

project group sought to understand: 

• What were the challenges of working locally with NHS Trusts?   

• What helps to make the case locally and get involved in patient information?   

• What advice or tips might be helpful for colleagues working on similar projects? 

The key learning points from these conversations were as follows: 

• LKS have a role to play in providing accurate evidence based patient information leaflets 
(PILs). 

• Changes to the process or suggesting changes to the language used in leaflets can be 

challenging when influencing authors who were generally from clinical teams.  

• Access to leaflets can vary from written form only, availability in local clinical teams or 

accessible online via the trust web site or portal. 

• It is not always clear when leaflets were last updated or who was the original author. LKS 

involvement often led to the development of a systematic approach to routinely reviewing 

leaflets. 

• LKS use of searching the evidence base to update leaflets can be patchy. However, it was 

acknowledged LKS have the appropriate skills and are best placed to undertake this work 

although capacity and resource of their service needed to be considered. 

• LKS have a role in advocating the use of plain language. 

• Using nationally produced leaflets had its place but there was merit in maintaining leaflets 

that outlined local procedures. 

• Finding stakeholders to champions LKS involvement, especially at board level was essential. 

Some trusts found they had greater engagement with board members from their 

involvement in PILs. 

• Building on existing relationships was important; where an LKS had good links and was 

already seen as the “go-to” place for evidence generally (for example, for clinicians’ own 

use) this was often a stepping stone to having the opportunity to provide the evidence for 

patient information leaflets.  

• It is important to think about how to demonstrate impact and cost/benefit of LKS providing 

this support 

A full account of the conversations held is in Appendix 2.

2: Influencing evidence based patient information 
An influencing exercise was undertaken in three NHS Trusts.  This involved three members of the 

project group who currently work in NHS Trusts undertaking the following steps: 

• Establishing an understanding of existing processes and systems in place locally for the 

production of patient information. 

• Making contact with key individuals involved in these processes to gain an understanding of 

the opportunities and challenges. 

Individual reflective case studies have been captured by the library professional working in each NHS 

Trust.  Many reflections were specific to local organisational culture and processes; however, some 

common themes emerged: 

• The importance of timing: The success of influencing a Trust to adopt an organisation-wide 

approach to evidence based patient information depends on organisational readiness. 

• Prioritisation: One success factor is the degree to which evidence based patient information 

is prioritised and whether there is a responsible individual / group / team in place. 

• Understanding local processes: Understanding what processes are in place already can 

assist LKS staff when making the case for using evidence. 

• Health literacy is also a key component, and the link must be made between high quality 

information but also presenting it in a meaningful way and not assuming overly high levels of 

health literacy.  

• Importance of building relationships: Building productive working relationships can take 

time but ultimately is key to the success of any influencing exercise. 

• High quality patient information is acknowledged as important, however this can sometimes 

only focus on language and making the leaflets understandable and factually correct, rather 

than on actively using the evidence base. The link here may need to be made more explicit. 

• Service user engagement: as with any service development involving patients and carers can 

help to enhance patient information by ensuring it is written in plain language and 

understandable. 

• Demonstrate how libraries can save time:  by highlighting the time saving element of using 

the library service to identify evidence for patient information, will encourage staff to utilise 

our skills and make the process more efficient for others.

3: Project outputs 
The project group produced the following outputs to support other library and knowledge 

professionals in influencing evidence based health information in their own settings. 

• Slidedeck - for LKS colleagues, for LKS leads  

• Animation 

• Stakeholder map  

• Further information resources  

4: Conclusions, recommendations, next steps 

Conclusions 
The final conclusions from the project as a whole are as follows: 

• Evidence based health information makes a positive contribution to health care systems, 

including empowering patients and families, supporting evidence based decision-making and 

mitigating financial pressures. 

• The need for evidence based health information is aligned with a number of high-level 

strategic priorities and drivers, including patient engagement, patient experience and shared 

decision-making. 

• Influencing evidence based health information is not straightforward for library and 

knowledge professionals; our ability to influence is dependent on a range of factors 

including local organisational culture and priorities. 

• Sharing learning and experiences between library and knowledge professionals is a valuable 

and worthwhile approach to expanding our capabilities around influencing evidence based 

health information. 

Next steps 

• A blog post will be published on the Knowledge for Healthcare site in 2019 to promote the 

findings of the final report which will be added to the PPI project pages. 

• A blog post will be published on the King’s Fund web site to promote the work library and 

information professionals play in providing evidence based information. 

• Project findings and outputs will be cascaded to online networks (e.g. #ukmedlibs and 

#uklibchat) and LKS leads, including the Quality Improvement Outcomes group 

• Project findings and outputs will be presented at regional LKS/ network events – Midlands & 

East (Dec 2018), North (March 2019), London & KSS (Date TBC), South (subject to availability 

and date TBC) 

Recommendations 

• Patient information is a key part of our “offer” – whether a service has a dedicated role or 

not. If the LKS is championing evidence based practice in the organisation, patient 

information is part of that.  

• Supporting evidence based patient information may require specific attention and a slightly 

novel approach; building on existing influencing skills and relationships with clinicians, as

well as having some good examples and reasons to hand during these conversations may 

help.    

• It may help to make the link between patient information and providing tailored support to 

colleagues. Library and knowledge services should be encouraged to do this in the new 

national Quality Impact Outcomes. In the pilot QIO - standard 3 is about LKS facilitating 

access to, and driving the use of, evidence and knowledge across the organisation; standard 

4 – responsive to user needs; standard 6 – effective and efficient; and obviously 

demonstrating impact is also key.

Appendix 1: Reflective case studies 

Case Study 1 : Overview of Evidence Based Patient Information 
Aim 

To scope current processes in place at an acute hospital around the inclusion of evidence in the 

creation of patient information and library and knowledge services support. 

Who was contacted? 

• Head of Clinical Governance 

• Patient Information and Advisory Lead (PALS) 

• Patient Experience Manager 

• Equality and Diversity Lead  

• Hospital Business Manager 

Background and Current position 

The EIDO Healthcare resource was procured 8 years ago by the hospital Business Manager and is 

available via the hospital intranet.  The EIDO resource is an evidence-based patient information 

online library of over 320 leaflets relating to procedures and treatments available nationally. 

Healthcare staff at the hospital can use EIDO to support patients around informed consent about 

their treatment. A survey conducted in October 2018 with 67 respondents,  highlighted a disparity of 

the in-house patient information produced across the organisation, what is produced and evidently 

if evidence-based.  These findings were presented by the hospital Business Manager to Directors and 

resulted in an action plan involving Library and Knowledge Services.  An audit of all patient 

information across the hospital was conducted in spring 2019, with a review of findings in summer 

2019.  As part of the action plan a conference on patient information and consent was held at the 

hospital in March 2019 attended by 110 staff.  

Patient Information and Consent Group 

Members:  Communications IT Lead, Trust Business Manager and Library and Knowledge Services 

Manager 

Aim: To produce an action plan for Directors on: 

- The position on what information is provided to patients 

- Processes involved in the management and tracking of patient information across the 

organisation 

- If the information provided is evidence-based 

 

  

 

 

  



 

11 
 

The number of responses, 45% who skipped this question indicated uncertainty around 

responsibility for who produced information for patients within services.  This 

demonstrated a need for clear processes and communication at all levels within the 

organisation. 

Group aim:   

An audit was conducted for staff to submit information provided to patients. At a glance 

it presented an insight into what is produced across the organisation, the quality and if 

evidence-based.    

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

Key Survey Findings and Action Plan 

 

Just over half of those who responded were not aware of what processes were involved 

in the production of information for patients. Similarly this question correlates to 

another whereby 45% were not aware if there was a tracking system for the notification 

for expired patient information.  This highlighted the need for better systems to be 

established across services to remove errors and risks to patients. 

Group aim:   

To scope how better process systems could be implemented to enable effective 

management of patient information and identify good practice to help patients make 

informed decisions about their care. 

 

 

 

 

 

The creation of evidence-based patient information is critical for patients to ensure 

accuracy and reliability.  17% who responded were uncertain if this procedure was 

undertaken. 

Group aim: 

As champions in the provision of evidence-based information, the role of library and 

knowledge services professionals was central in re-enforcing the importance of the 

production of good quality information.  In the absence of the hospital Business 

Manager, the Library and Knowledge Services Manager co-ordinated a successful 

conference on patient information and consent attended by a range of hospital staff. 

The event was opened by a Trust Director and with presentations from consent and 

EIDO representatives.  Library services provided a stall where attendees could find 

out more about evidence-based support in producing information for patients.  The 

event also provided a great opportunity to showcase a HEE project by a group of 

library and knowledge specialists on how evidence can be used in the creation and 

review of information for patients. 

 

 

Despite the EIDO system being available, 66% of staff were not aware of the resource.  

Whist other results showed that 69% knew how to access the system with a further 

47 % requesting training. 

Group aim:   

Library and Knowledge Services staff was trained as EIDO champions to raise 

awareness of the resource through promotion. Working with the communications 

team, a screen saver promoting EIDO was showcased on hospital PC’s and a poster 

created was made available on all wards.  In the 30 days prior to the patient 

information and consent conference, there were 90 individual downloads on EIDO by 

hospital staff.  In the 30 days immediately following the conference there were 143 

downloads.  The average monthly downloads are 127, so the increase was probably 

attributable to the conference.

Case study 2: Mental Health, Learning Disabilities and Neurorehabilitation 

Trust  
Background 

This Trust provides mental health, learning disabilities and neuro-rehabilitation services in the north 
of England. The Patient Information Centre Manager co-ordinates and maintains patient information 
on behalf of the Trust.   

 
The trust has a policy on The Production of Accessible Information for Patients, Carers and the 
Public which has been in place for several years.  The policy highlights the importance of patient 
information to patient experience, “ensuring that patients have greater power, protection and 
choice in key aspects of their healthcare.” It states that patient leaflets should meet the criterion in 
the NHS England Information Standard, which includes being evidence based.  
 
Process 
 
Library services are included as part of the process either in delivering literature searches or by 
facilitating access to online evidence. All patient information leaflets are reviewed and updated on a 
three yearly cycle and follow the following steps: 
 

• Justification and support for developing new information, without duplicating national or 
local work. 

• It reflects existing patient information and links to other service priorities 

• Content is checked and updates by clinicians responsible for the procedure or patient care in 
conjunction with the Patient Information centre. 

• Information is evidence based and referenced appropriately, with support from library 
services. 

• Resources will not endorse or promote products or third party services 

• Patient information resources should be written in a concise and unambiguous style using 
plain English. Consider producing in other languages and making available in other accessible 
formats on request. 

• Content – the information must reflect the procedure and must contain facts about risks, 
possible side effects, benefits or alternatives to the treatment, procedure or investigation. 
The evidence should be references. 

• Authors should ensure appropriate review and consultation with service users, carers and 
stakeholders takes place. 

• Staff in the Patient Information Centre will ensure corporate identity guidelines and 
accessible information guidance is followed. 

• Draft information is checked for accuracy before being sent for approval to the appropriate 
director(s). 

• Once formatted, completed resources are added to the Patient Information Centre website 
and database  

 

Reflections 

Having a documented process with an allocated patient information manager helps to give some 

visibility and governance to the production of good quality information.   

Sourcing evidence for patient information is a core part of our literature search service. It can save 

clinical staff time and effort in identifying recent evidence.

Case Study 3: Overview of the provision of Evidence Based Patient 

Information  
Aim 

To investigate and understand the existing processes and procedures in place around the creation, 

provision and review of patient information leaflets in an acute hospital, and how library services 

might influence and support the process to ensure that all information made available is evidence 

based.    

Background 

Trust documentation states that ‘Patient 

information is a key component of the patient 

journey and central to the overall quality of 

each patient’s experience of the NHS’.  

A number of documents are available via the 

Trust intranet to guide staff when they are 

creating or updating patient information 

leaflets.   

• Patient Information Policy 

‘Leaflet to contain other sources of 

information and key reference source(s) 

used in the leaflet’s production.’  

‘Training, the Patient Information 

Facilitator will provide workshops on 

producing quality, authenticated PILs.’ 

‘Patient Information Steering Group meets 

at regular intervals.’ 

• How to produce quality, authenticated 

patient information leaflets (PILS) 

‘Provide key reference sources used in the 

compiling of the leaflet. These should be 

specific and evidence based 

• Patient Information Leaflet Self-

Assessment Form. 

‘…information contains specific references 

of literature…provides assurance to the 

reader that the information is from a 

credible and evidence based source that is 

current and relevant.’ 

A comprehensive checklist must be completed 

when a patient information leaflet undergoes 

any change or a new leaflet is to be created, 

this must be counter signed by a senior 

clinician/manager. 

Current Position 

Further investigation identified that at 

present a Patient Information Facilitator is not 

in post and that the Trust’s Patient 

Information Lead is responsible for overseeing 

the creation and review of Patient 

Information Leaflets, all leaflets are created in 

a house style and meet the Information 

Standard.   

The importance of ensuring leaflets are 

understandable and well written is recognised 

and given perhaps greater emphasis than the 

source of any supporting evidence. All leaflets 

are available on the Trust website.  It is the 

responsibility of the leaflet author to ensure 

and confirm that information sources used 

and referred to are evidence based.   

In reality, there is little practical support in 

place to assist leaflet authors to ensure that 

the sources they refer to are evidence based.  

To date the Library Service has not been 

involved with the process. 

Conversations 

Having identified those in key roles, contact 

was made by phone and email and a meeting 

arranged with the Patient Information Lead, 

who was able to confirm that; the Patient 



 

14 
 

Information Policy is due for review, that a 

Patient Information Steering Group no longer 

meets and that there are no plans to reinstate 

the group.  Quarterly training on leaflet 

creation referred to in the Patient Information 

policy is not currently taking place.   

Following the initial meeting, leaflet authors 

will now be directed to the Library Service for 

help/training in accessing evidence based 

information. The Patient Information Policy is 

currently being updated and will include 

signposting to the Library Service.  

Reflections 

• Time and Timing 

It takes time to identify key individuals and 

build relationships.  This is an ongoing 

process. 

Lack of time impacts on the ability of staff to 

update and create new patient information 

leaflets, this creates an opportunity for the 

Library Service to highlight the comprehensive 

and professional evidence searching services 

that can be provided and which can save Trust 

staff  valuable time.  

Timing is important, the point at which a 

policy or process is due for review can be an 

opportune time for the Library Service to 

become involved. 

• Understanding local processes 

 

Understanding what processes and 

procedures are already in place can assist 

Library professionals when making the case 

for using evidence.  This requires a degree of 

persistence and making the most of existing 

contacts and building new relationships with 

other key individuals. 

 

• Prioritisation 

In this situation, although the process is well 

managed and the importance of well written, 

authoritative patient information is clearly 

recognised, there is a single part time 

member of staff responsible for overseeing 

the provision of patient information across 

the Trust.   

Next Steps 

• Building Relationships 

Follow up with the Patient Information Lead 

to continue building a productive working 

relationship.   

• A Core Service 

Providing evidence searches and training are a 

core part of the Library Service.  Providing 

assistance to Trust staff with the provision of 

patient information should be viewed in the 

same way and advertised and promoted along 

with other Library services and resources

Reflective record of conversations held during an influencing exercise 

within an acute Hospital.  
 

Reflection 1 

Details of conversation - who/when etc  

Library Manager meeting with Patient Information Lead, October 2018. 

What happened?   

Unfortunately, the meeting was cancelled as the Patient Information Lead has been signed off on 

sick leave.  At present there is no-one else within the team to cover the role in their absence.             

So what?   

Reinforces the difficulties of influencing and making contacts when key staff are unavailable.  Also, it 

takes time take to build relationships and this is perhaps beyond the timings of this project.         

Now what?   

 I will keep in contact to find out when the Patient Information Lead is back at work and then re-

arrange to meet.

Library Manager meeting with Patient Information Lead, November 2018.  

What happened?   

 I met with the Patient Information Lead to talk through the process of PIL creation, monitoring and 

review in the Trust and to try and gain a better understanding of how the actual process in place 

relates to that described in the Trust Patient Information Policy and other documentation on the 

intranet.  A new post holder took over as Patient Information Lead after a staffing gap of approx 18 

months, and works 2 days a week.  Their main role is to maintain the spreadsheet of PILS which are 

available on the Trust website and check completed leaflets against the Information Standard.   The 

Patient Information Lead’s remit is much more concerned with the look and feel, font size, tone etc 

and if the leaflet meets the IS, than whether the information is evidence based.  They are reliant on 

the author and the counter signatory (Senior Clinician, Consultant or Senior Manager) to confirm 

that they have consulted relevant evidence.     

Staff updating or creating new PILS currently follow the Patient Information Leaflet Self-Assessment 

Form 2018, which was recently updated.  This is a detailed checklist, leaflet authors must tick to 

confirm: ‘The information contains specific references of literature that have assisted with its 

production.  This provides assurance to the reader that the information is from a credible and 

evidence based source that is current and relevant.’  The Patient Information Lead is currently 

updating the Patient Information Policy as this is now out of date and is looking to simplify the 

document.   They confirmed that the Patient Information Group no longer meets and that there are 



 

16 
 

no plans to reinstate the group.  The quarterly training on leaflet creation referred to in the current 

policy is not currently taking place.     

So what?   

 It was a useful meeting and I'm glad to have been able to talk to the key person involved.  As the 

policy is currently being updating the Patient Information Lead agreed to include signposting to the 

Library in the new document and to amend the Self-Assessment form to direct staff to the Library 

team for help / training in accessing evidence based information. We also talked about mentioning 

the Library team as a source of help when the Patient Information Lead contacts staff by email to 

remind them to update leaflets.     

Now what?   

I’m not sure, although it was a useful meeting, I’m not sure quite how much of an impact I had. 

Going forward I think I’ll speak to the Patient Information Lead again, perhaps by email, to suggest 

that as a library we promote to Trust staff that we are available to assist with providing the evidence 

and that, actually, this is just another of our core services.    

Reflection 3 

Details of conversation - who/when etc  

Library Manager meeting with Patient Information Lead, November 2018.     

What happened?   

Following my meeting with the Patient Information Lead at the Trust, I sent a follow-up email 

thanking them for their time and providing the Library’s contact details.  This was so that the Patient 

Information Lead can sign-post staff to the Library team, for help conducting searches and/ or 

training in using healthcare databases, when they are updating or creating new leaflets.    During our 

meeting the Patient Information Lead had mentioned that staff often cite lack of time as a reason 

why they are unable to update leaflets so I also asked whether there would be any scope to add to  

the PIL assessment form next time it is updated.  If it would be possible to include ‘Have the Library 

Team (xxx@nhs.net) conducted an evidence search for you?’   This would help ensure that more 

leaflets are created using the most up to date evidence, and to assist and encourage those who 

aren’t updating leaflets because of a lack of time.   

So what?   

 I hope to continue to build a productive working relationship, however this may take some time.    

Now what?   

 I’ve yet to receive a response to my email, and may have to wait until the revised policy document is 

available.  As a Library Service we will proactively market our evidence searching service as a tool to 

assist with creating and updating PILs.

Appendix 2: Learning from local library networks 

Patient Information Librarian 
Patient information leaflets currently produced at the trust are accessible on the web site. However, 
an initial issue was understanding how many patient leaflets are being produced in-house within the 
trust and how often these were reviewed.  Through their role, they were aware that ‘health’ is the 
second most searched topic on Google. A concern was patients searching for information about their 
health conditions find information but have no knowledge of how to interpret or appraise the 
quality and authority. They felt LKS have a role to play in providing accurate evidence based patient 
information and can assist in adapting text to make leaflets more understandable for patients. New 
leaflets are uploaded and stored on to the trust web site but evidence searches carried out by the 
LKS to inform the content are added to Knowledgeshare. 
 
Currently the LKS is setting up an overarching committee where updated or new PILs would be 
reviewed and signed off at a senior level. This group will initially include staff representatives but 
longer term the committee would aim to include a patient representation.  
 
Resources have also been developed by the LKS to demonstrate best practice and quality in 

producing PILs. These resources include NICE guidelines, information from health charities, and 

suggestions of ways simplify language and again are accessible for anyone on KnowledgeShare. 

Library and Knowledge Services Manager, at a Large Hospital/ Foundation 

Trust 
The LKS team at the Hospital are heavily involved in providing evidence in the production of patient 

information and it is provided for in the policy. The library has a literature search protocol for patient 

information, and an ordered list of evidence sources, to ensure this is done in a robust, consistent 

manner. Many of these documents were developed during the Library Manager's time as Clinical 

Librarian and further developed in the library service. Developing relationships with clinicians and 

within and across departments was naturally a key part of this role, and specifically targeting patient 

information, or doing anything differently here, wasn’t seen as a separate priority at the time, rather 

it was one of the many types of information that the Clinical Librarian and LKS would provide – the 

need for good quality evidence and the role of the library in providing it was promoted and 

acknowledged for a variety of purposes, and patient information was a natural part of this. 

Over time this has developed naturally and by word of mouth; and is now seen as a regular part of 

the library’s offer – as one team uses the library to support their patient information, another team 

looking to do something similar would naturally follow the same process; essentially good practice 

has spread. It was due to these good relationships and custom and practice (and having robust 

processes such as the protocols) that when the Patient Information Policy was being developed, the 

Patient Information lead contacted the Library Manager to ask for their support and input. They also 

drew on examples from elsewhere – such as those on the Patient and Public Information Ideas Bank, 

particularly Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The Cancer Manual was another natural next 

step for the service and again, looking at good practice elsewhere led to them looking at the NHS in 

Scotland, particularly NHS Lothian. 

The Library Manager and the team are aware of challenges facing the production of patient 

information, such as whether the Information Standard will be kept – if this goes, they perceive it 



 

18 
 

may be one less driver to produce good quality patient information. This scenario is something they 

are aware of and thinking of. As with everything, the pressures of time and workload can mean 

sometimes it is difficult for clinicians to find the time to factor in contacting the LKS to request this 

support.  

This example shows the effectiveness of building good relationships with colleagues across the trust 

and understanding their needs, as well as maintaining awareness of specific drivers (such as the 

Information Standard) and good practice elsewhere. By the Library Manager's own account, they 

didn’t begin with a separate strategy around patient information, but it was something that 

developed out of positive relationships with their colleagues and became a natural step from their 

offer. Formalising it as part of the Policy built on prior work, rather than being the starting point for 

them. Essentially; good practice and a culture of evidence based practice were spread across the 

trust over time, and eventually formalised into the policy. 

Patient Information Librarian 
As a recently appointed Patient Information Librarian the reporting structure was to the Consent 

Committee within their trust as well as their line manager in the Library and Information Service. 

They initially carried out a patient leaflet audit which highlighted there were many leaflets created 

and maintained across different clinical medical team, and many were showing an expired ‘review’ 

date. The trust had not employed a central person to support patient information for 10 years. 

Reviewing PILs was not routinely carried out and finding authors willing to update content was 

difficult. The team were keen to demonstrate how their involvement would ensure evidence based 

information was available, easy to find and easy to understand.   

Through the Patient Information role literature searches were offered to staff to support updating of 

PILs which took up a significant part of their role; updating content, checking sources and adapting 

the language to being clearer to patients. The patient information service can offer skills in 

organising information    

They also recognised if PILs were not systematically updated this would be a risk for the 

organisation. The team found the Listening into Action” exercise helped in getting engagement from 

people at senior levels about the issue of risk Through this work LKS has experienced greater contact 

with the board and some of their biggest champions are non-exec directors.  

 Ideally more resources to support this work would be welcome, especially for reviewing and 

updating the significant quantity of patient information leaflets.  

Additional information 

They see their role as: 

• Facilitating the development of a single repository of information about healthcare at our 

hospitals. This has been launched but needs investment of time and admin support to 

become fully populated with the thousands of pieces of patient information we use; and to 

provide cataloguing, active management, version  



 

19 
 

• Developing Patient Information Leads across the Trust.  Approximately 70 services that 

should each have a person responsible for tracking the leaflets they use, their review dates 

and identifying authors to update in a timely way.  This is currently patchy at best. 

• Setting up governance structures to quality assure the leaflets that are created and updated, 

particularly to try to mitigate risks to the Trust if the informed consent process isn’t robust, 

but also to improve patient experience and shared-decision making 

• Promoting health literacy principles, providing training for all staff and encouraging our 

organisation to be health literacy friendly.   

• Act as a member of a working group aiming to achieve compliance with the Accessible 

Information Standard and have strong links with the equality team regarding translation of 

leaflets 

• Working with the wider healthcare community to raise awareness of YourHealth as a tool to 

increase patient knowledge at the point of referral into the hospital; discharge or transition 

into other services. 

• Assisting the Trust with their vision for eConsent and having high-quality, evidence-based 

patient information integrated into each eConsent record. 

Outreach Librarian, at a Foundation Trust 
The LKS role in supporting the production of patient information leaflets (PILs) is very established as 

a core service for about 10 years. It was developed from the outreach team after a decision was 

made to review leaflets aimed at 11 year olds. From there on, it has been expanded to all PILs across 

the trust. The outreach team have always worked in partnership with other teams across the trust 

on PILs. 

The Outreach Librarian developed a patient information process to ensure all leaflets are up-to-date 

and meet the Information Standard. The workflow document outlines what level of amendments 

requires a review by the Outreach Librarian and what can be done by the author. LKS check high 

level reports and guidance but not primary evidence. The team also perform 30 annual audits for 30 

randomly selected leaflets which check for version control, compliance, brand and grammar, 

relevant references and support groups inclusion. PILs are stored on a central resource accessible 

across the trust. This process and way of working was expanded across other LKS teams after a 

merger of two trusts to ensure consistency.  

The Outreach Librarian felt this was an extremely valuable service where staff were generally 

compliant to the process. SWOT analysis of the service demonstrated positive compliance, it helps 

remove risk, it was cost-effective and most leaflets were regularly reviewed. However, it also 

highlighted some issues around a number of leaflets not going through the process and data stored 

locally on individuals’ devices rather than centrally.

1 Health system considerations   

1.1 The need for patient information is acknowledged, but the quality of 
patient information across NHS organisations is variable. 

Evidence 
search 

1.2 In the literature, when patient information is described as “high quality”, 
it doesn’t necessarily mean “evidence based”. Although this is implied, 
the link between quoting clinical evidence and making a leaflet 
understandable is sometimes not made in patient information policies. 

Evidence 
search 

1.3 High quality, evidence-based patient information has a positive impact on 
service utilisation and health costs, patients’ experience of healthcare 
and patients’ health behaviour and status. 

Evidence 
search (PiF 
report) 

1.4 High quality, evidence-based patient information “unlocks” patient 
engagement, which is vital to help people manage their health, make 
informed decisions about their healthcare, and mitigate financial 
pressure on the health service. 

Evidence 
search (PiF 
report) 

1.5 High quality, evidence-based patient information makes good business 
sense: There are positive impacts on service use and costs, substantial 
capacity savings, significant returns on investment by increasing the self-
management of long-term conditions and attracting customers. 

Evidence 
search (PiF 
report) 

1.6 High quality patient information is necessary to enhance the patient 
experience; a key driver for NHS Trust boards and senior leaders. 

Evidence 
search (PiF 
report) 

1.7 Actively involving people in decisions about their healthcare helps to 
reduce unwarranted variations in treatment. 

Evidence 
search (PiF 
report) 

1.8 It empowers patients and families and supports them to make evidence 
based decisions about their care. 

Evidence 
search 
(Wegwarth) 

1.9 It reduces unnecessary interventions including antibiotic prescribing and 
repeat GP consultations. 

Evidence 
search (de 
Bont, 2015) 

2 LKS capacity  

2.1 There is a role for LKS in providing evidence support though capacity 
needs to be considered. 

Interviews 

2.2 Sourcing evidence for patient information is a core part of our literature 
search service. It can save clinical staff time and effort in identifying 
recent evidence. 

Case studies 
(NTW) 

2.3 Other health care roles, e.g. Apprentice or volunteer can help to audit 
patient information leaflets. 

Case studies 

3 Organisational culture  



 

21 
 

3.1 The success of influencing a Trust to adopt an organisation-wide 
approach to evidence based patient information depends on 
organisational readiness. 

Case studies 

3.2 One success factor is the degree to which evidence based patient 
information is prioritised and whether there is a responsible individual / 
group / team in place. 

Case studies 

3.3 Trusts can focus on language and making the leaflets understandable and 
factually correct, rather than on actively using the evidence base. 

Case studies 

3.4 The quality of patient information produced in-house is variable. 
 
Case study survey:  
91% of respondents (n=61) provide information to patients. When asked, 
“Is the information evidence based?”, 17% (n=8) didn’t know, and 19 
skipped the question. 
 

Case studies 

3.5 Capacity of the person / team responsible for patient information may be 
limited. 

Case studies 

4 Organisational processes  

4.1 Access to leaflets can vary from written form only, availability in local 
clinical teams or accessible online via the trust web site or portal. 

Interviews 

4.2 It is not always clear when leaflets were last updated or who was the 
original author. LKS involvement often led to the development of a 
systematic approach to routinely reviewing leaflets. 

Interviews 

4.3 LKS use of searching the evidence base to update leaflets can be patchy. 
However, it was acknowledged LKS have the appropriate skills and are 
best placed to undertake this work although capacity and resource of 
their service needed to be considered. 

Interviews 

4.4 Using nationally produced leaflets had its place but there was merit in 
maintaining leaflets that outlined local procedures. 

Interviews  

4.5 There may not be sufficient support in place for patient information 
leaflet authors . 

Case studies  

4.6 The process described in a patient information policy may not reflect the 
reality. 

Case studies 

4.7 Having a documented process with an allocated patient information 
manager helps to give some visibility and governance to the production 
of good quality information. 

Case studies 
(NTW) 

5 Influencing  

5.1 Understanding what processes are in place already can assist LKS staff 
when making the case for using evidence. 

Case studies 

5.2 Building productive working relationships can take time but ultimately is 
key to the success of any influencing exercise. 

Case studies 

5.3 Highlighting the time saving element of using the library service to 
identify evidence for patient information will encourage staff to utilise 
our skills and make the process more efficient for others. 

Case studies 

5.4 Impending CQC inspection can be a good lever. Case studies 
(Walsall) 

5.5 Changes to the process or suggesting changes to the language used in 
leaflets can be challenging when influencing authors who were generally 
from clinical teams. 

Interviews 

5.6 Building on existing relationships was important; where an LKS had good 
links and was already seen as the “go-to” place for evidence generally 

Interviews 



 

22 
 

(for example, for clinicians’ own use) this was often a stepping stone to 
having the opportunity to provide the evidence for patient information 
leaflets. 

5.7 It can take time to identify who is responsible for patient information and 
what processes are in place. 
Key people that it might be helpful to approach (if available) are: 

• Author(s) of a patient information policy 

• Patient Information Lead 

• Patient Information Group / Committee 

• Reading group 

• Patient Information Centre / Macmillan Hub 

• Communications team 

• Clinical Governance team 

• Quality Assurance team 

• Patient Advisory Liaison (PALs) 

• Chaplains 

Case studies  

5.8 It is important to think about how to demonstrate impact and 
cost/benefit of LKS providing this support. 

Interviews 

6 Literacy  

6.1 Health literacy is also a key component, and the link must be made 
between high quality information but also presenting it in a meaningful 
way and not assuming overly high levels of health literacy. 

Case studies 

6.2 Involving patients and carers can help to enhance patient information by 
ensuring it is written in plain language and understandable. 

Case studies 

6.3 LKS have a role in advocating the use of plain language. Interviews
