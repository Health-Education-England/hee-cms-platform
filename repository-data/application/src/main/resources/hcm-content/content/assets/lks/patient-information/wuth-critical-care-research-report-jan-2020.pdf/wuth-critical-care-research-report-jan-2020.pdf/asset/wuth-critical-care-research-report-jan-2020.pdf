“When the clinical librarian first came on the ward, 
we thought, ‘A librarian? What would we want a 
librarian here for?’ But do you know what, the culture 
then changed because the clinical librarian would say, 
‘I’ll look that up for you.’ All of sudden, everyone 
thought that having a clinical librarian on the ward 
was quite a good idea.” (Nurse) 

“The clinical librarian’s presence keeps 
people thinking, ‘why are we doing it this 
way, and are there other ways of doing 
this?” (Nurse) 

“I think the model certainly informed the care a 
lot better. I think there are differences of opinion 
between consultants, and I think the model 
helped inform what to do.” (Junior doctor) 

“At the end of a ward 
round, a question 
would come up, and 
the clinical librarian 
would do a very quick 
literature search, and 
speak to us afterwards 
to let us know the 
current situation and 
the current evidence.” 
(Consultant) 

“The clinical librarian saved me a lot of time because I needed 
someone who could get me the latest guidelines, the latest 
evidence, and access it very quickly.” (Nurse) 

“[The librarian] was able to get me all the latest 
research, without me having to go trawling out, 
she was just there, immediately, on-site. So if 
found that actually very, very useful. (Nurse) 

“Sometimes a patient would have an 
illness that we didn’t know much 
about, and the clinical librarian would 
get us an article or a piece of research 
that we would give to the patient and 
say, ‘Have a read of this, and you’ll 
learn more about what’s going on.’ 
And that was of great help.” (Nurse) 

“When I was doing my master’s, the 
clinical librarian saved me time and 
stress. I was trying to hold down a 
fulltime job and do the course. It’s 
pretty tough.” (Nurse)

1. Summary 

1.1 Background 
Mobilising knowledge involves making information accessible and useable. In the healthcare setting, effective 
knowledge mobilisation ensures that staff can easily access, understand and apply information to practice. In critical 
care, knowledge about complex conditions and treatments can be difficult for staff, patients and families to navigate. A 
clinical librarian is a specialist role that combines technical skills (such as evidence searching and summarising) with the 
necessary personal attributes to mobilise knowledge effectively. 
 
In this mixed-methods study, a model of knowledge mobilisation tailored to critical care was designed and implemented 
by a clinical librarian in an acute teaching hospital in the UK. The model was evaluated and the potential return on 
financial investment examined. This is the first study to our knowledge that has measured the contribution and return 
on investment (ROI) of the clinical librarian role specifically in a critical care setting.  
 

1.2 Approach 
This mixed-methods study was composed of three phases: 
 

● Phase 1 involved identifying knowledge requirements  
● Phase 2 involved designing and implementing a knowledge mobilisation model 
● Phase 3 involved evaluating the model and measuring ROI 

 

1.2.1 Phase 1: Identifying knowledge requirements 
During phase 1 of the study, critical care staff were asked to complete a questionnaire about their knowledge 
requirements. Interviews and focus groups were also conducted with critical care staff, as well as critical care patients 
and their family members, to identify what are their knowledge requirements. This methodological triangulation 
enabled the validity of the questionnaire data and interview data to be established. 
 
Questionnaire and interview data revealed that critical care staff required knowledge that was: 

● Available to support all aspects of care 
● Visible and accessible to everyone 
● Available through multiple channels, both face-to-face and online 
● Discussed and shared between colleagues 

Critical care staff found seeking and applying knowledge to be challenging for many reasons, including lack of time, 
pressure on resources, and limited experience of knowledge-seeking.  
 
Questionnaire and interview data revealed that critical care patients and their families wanted knowledge about their 
condition and treatment that was: 



7 
 

 
● Primarily delivered via the bedside nurse 
● Repeated and reinforced at appropriate milestones of care 
● In multiple formats (both verbal and paper) 
● Complemented by their own knowledge in the form of photographs or diaries 

 
Findings from phase 1 informed the development of a knowledge mobilisation model (phase 2).  
 

1.2.2 Phase 2: Designing and implementing a model of knowledge mobilisation 
During phase 2 of the study, a knowledge mobilisation model was designed and implemented by a clinical librarian. The 
clinical librarian was embedded within the department and provided support to critical care staff through a number of 
activities, such as:  

● Being available at specific times each week (i.e. providing a ‘pop-up library’ service) 
● Delivering academic study skills training (e.g. how to perform literature searches) 
● Supporting a consultant-led departmental journal club where junior doctors could discuss research papers 
● Moderating a peer-to-peer learning environment for critical care staff through a Facebook group 
● Facilitating a book box where critical care staff could access relevant literature 

The model was flexible and refined over a 15-month period in response to observations from the research team and 
feedback from critical care staff. 
 

1.2.3 Phase 3: Evaluating the model and exploring return on investment (ROI) 
During phase 3 of the study, critical care staff were asked to evaluate the knowledge mobilisation model by completing a 
questionnaire or taking part in an interview or focus group. Findings demonstrated that the knowledge mobilisation 
model: 
 

● Supported staff learning and education 
● Improved the quality of care 
● Nurtured an evidence-based culture 
● Generated a positive financial value 

 
To evaluate the efficiency/cost-benefit of the investment of the knowledge mobilisation model, ROI analysis was 
performed using questionnaire and interview data from critical care staff. Total monetised benefits were based on the 
contribution of the knowledge mobilisation model to time saving for critical care staff, professional development for 
nurses, and improved patient care. The ROI analysis indicated that for every £1 invested in the knowledge mobilisation 
model, a financial value in a range from £1.18 to £3.03 was generated. 

 

1.3 Conclusions  
In critical care where the evidence base can be complex, staff have a clear need for knowledge support; this need can 
feasibly be met by a clinical librarian-led model of knowledge mobilisation.   



8 
 

 
The model of knowledge mobilisation in this study helped critical care staff to learn, develop and improve the quality of 
their care.  It nurtured an evidence-based culture across the department and generated a positive financial value from 
saving staff time, supporting their professional development and improving patient care. 
 
This study has developed and tested an approach to ROI analysis in clinical librarian services.  This approach should be 
further tested and refined in future studies.   

 

1.4 Recommendations 
1. Critical care units should consider employing a clinical librarian within the multidisciplinary team and recognise 

that this can be done in a way that generates a financial return. 
2. NHS Trusts should recognise their responsibility to support the knowledge requirements of staff to enhance 

patient care, and the contribution of the clinical librarian role to this. 
3. Further studies are needed to: 

a. evaluate clinical librarian interventions in other critical care departments and other healthcare settings; 
b. investigate further the financial return of employing a clinical librarian in a multidisciplinary healthcare 

team. 
4. Training and development opportunities should be developed specifically to support knowledge specialists to 

work in embedded roles.

2. Introduction  
 
Mobilising knowledge means making knowledge easy to access, easy to understand, and easy to apply.  Knowledge 
mobilisation is not simply a one-way flow of information; it involves engaging people in a discussion about how to share, 
appraise and apply knowledge more effectively. Other terms used to describe this process include knowledge diffusion, 
knowledge transfer, knowledge exchange and knowledge management. For consistency, the term knowledge 
mobilisation is used throughout this report. 
 
In a health care setting, knowledge might be newly-published research, practice-based knowledge from real-world 
experiences, or the attitudes and preferences of the patient. Knowledge mobilisation keeps healthcare professionals 
connected to research and other sources of information, empowering them to make informed improvements in their 
practice. Effective knowledge mobilisation is necessary to mitigate the barrage of new research that is published every 
day and bridge the gap between research and practice (Green, 2014; Smith & Wilkins, 2018).   
 
Clinical librarians are a group of professionals utilised in healthcare to mobilise knowledge. Clinical librarians are 
specialists with expertise in evidence searching and summarising, delivering information skills training, and mobilising 
knowledge. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team alongside nurses, doctors, managers and other healthcare 
professionals, predominantly in an acute hospital setting (Harrison & Beraquet, 2010).   
 
In this mixed-methods study, a model of knowledge mobilisation tailored to critical care was designed and implemented 
by a clinical librarian. The contribution of this model to patient care and staff development was evaluated. The potential 
return on financial investment of the clinical librarian was explored. This is the first study to our knowledge that has 
measured the contribution and ROI of the clinical librarian role specifically in a critical care setting.  
 
The aim of the research was to develop, implement and evaluate a model of knowledge mobilisation for critical care.  
 
The objectives were to: 

1. Identify the knowledge requirements of critical care staff, patients and their family members (Phase 1) 
2. Design and implement a knowledge mobilisation model and for a critical care environment (Phase 2) 
3. Evaluate the knowledge mobilisation model and estimate the ROI of implementing the model (Phase 3) 

 
 

2.1 Background to knowledge mobilisation 
 
The role of the clinical librarian is to facilitate knowledge mobilisation.  This involves bringing people together to build 
relationships, uncovering knowledge needs, sharing ideas and evidence with the aim of improving practice.  Another 
important function of the clinical librarian role is to act as a knowledge ‘broker’.  A knowledge broker is someone who 
aids the mobilisation of knowledge and supports others to do so (Elueze, 2015).  
 
Clinical librarians possess a range of technical skills, including evidence searching and summarising, that support them to 
effectively mobilise or broker knowledge from its producers (researchers) to its consumers (healthcare professionals, 
patients, families). The clinical librarian role combines technical skills with the personal attributes of a knowledge broker.

Lomas (2007) describes the attributes of a knowledge broker as: 

● Entrepreneurial (networking, problem solving, innovating) 
● Trusted and credible 
● Clear communicator 
● Understands the cultures of both the research and decision making environments 
● Able to find and assess relevant research in a variety of formats 
● Facilitates, mediates, and negotiates 
● Understands the principles of adult learning 

  
In the NHS in England, 58% of library services provide a clinical librarian (or outreach service) to underpin best practice 
and patient care by providing the best available evidence at the patient’s bedside and in the workplace (Health 
Education England, 2015). There are equivalent roles in health systems worldwide, including in the US, Canada and 
Australia. Clinical librarians are supported in their role by a network of library and knowledge services which provide 
access to evidence-based resources (databases, journals) and services (literature searching, document supply) (Health 
Education England, 2015). 

2.2 Mobilising knowledge for health care staff 
 
Evidence-based practice is required in the delivery of healthcare services so that best evidence from research is 
integrated with clinical policy and practice (Sackett et al., 1996).  The NHS in England has a duty to apply evidence 
obtained from research as decreed in the Health and Social Care Act (Department of Health, 2012).  However, there are 
a range of challenges in applying evidence to clinical practice: practitioners have difficulty finding, assessing, 
interpreting, and applying current best evidence (Haynes & Haines, 1998). Organisational cultural barriers that inhibit 
health care improvements include staff resistance, staff skills and knowledge, culture, lack of leadership, lack of funding 
and organisational culture (Health Foundation, 2015). 
 
In response to the challenge of applying evidence-based practice, clinical librarians employ a range of strategies to 
broker knowledge in a meaningful way.  These include educational activities (Thomas et al., 2006), guideline 
implementation (Grimshaw et al., 2001), audit, knowledge translation frameworks (Graham et al., 2006), safety 
checklists (WHO 2008) and quality improvement initiatives (Shojania & Grimshaw, 2004).   
 
A 2016 systematic review showed that information provided by librarians contributes directly to patient outcomes such 
as diagnosis; choice of intervention; improvements in quality of life; increased patient involvement in decision making, 
and improved access to patient information (Brettle et al., 2016).  Furthermore, direct contributions were also 
demonstrated for cost savings and risk management by avoiding tests, referrals and readmissions reducing length of 
stay. Qualitative findings illustrate how librarians contribute to patient care including advice given to the patient, 
diagnosis and choice of drugs (Marshall et al., 2013).   
 
Studies in general medicine and primary care have concluded that input from a librarian is associated with reduced 
length of stay (Banks et al., 2007), reduced referrals and return visits (McGowan et al., 2008), and is more likely to be 
effective in cases which are complex (Esparza, Shi, McLarty, Comegys, & Banks, 2013).  However, a quantitative 
approach may not solely be appropriate to understand the complexities of librarian input to clinical outcomes 
(Deshmukh & Roper, 2014). As well as potential confounders, finding suitable controls and ethical issues in withholding

11 
 

information have been problematic in quantitative studies (Banks et al., 2007; Mulvaney, Bickman, Giuse, Lambert, 
Sathe, & Jerome, 2008; McGowan et al., 2008; Esparza et al., 2013).   
 
In critical care the knowledge challenges experienced by practitioners, patients and families are exacerbated by the need 
for rapid decision-making and the critical nature of the illnesses being treated.  The critical care environment is high 
pressured, with high rates of patient mortality and staff burnout.  Patients are admitted with life-threatening conditions, 
family members are distressed, and health professionals are required to make clinical decisions at speed (Lane et al., 
2013; Rose, 2011; Hansen & Severinsson, 2009; Johnson et al., 2010).  Studies have shown that there is a wider than 
perceived gap between best evidence recommendations (what we know) and clinical practice (what we do) in critical 
care (Brunkhorst et al., 2008; Quenot et al., 2008; Leone et al., 2012; Heyland, Cahill, & Dhaliwal, 2010). 
 

 
 
 
 

Within critical care there is evidence to suggest that a librarian can influence treatment decisions by providing 
information within seven days of a ward round (Mulvaney et al., 2008).  Preliminary evidence from local pilot work 
suggests that a librarian can play an important role as a member of the critical care team (Sadera & Treadway, 2016). 
 

2.3 Mobilising knowledge for patients and families 
 
Critical care patients and family members represent a unique challenge in knowledge mobilisation. They identify lack of 
knowledge as a key factor that influences their experience (Auerbach, Kiesler, Wartella, Rausch, Ward, & Ivatury, 2005; 
Sherlock, Wilson, & Exley, 2009; Khalaila, 2013; Stricker, Kimberger, Schmidlin, Zwahlen, Mohr, & Rothen, 2009). Being 
admitted to critical care, or having a family member admitted, is an emotionally distressing experience, which can 
sometimes be worsened by insufficient knowledge about the condition or treatment. It is therefore crucial that patients 
and family members have access to accurate, evidence-based information. 
 

The critical care environment 



12 
 

However, interpreting health information in a meaningful way can present a challenge for patients and families. Up to 
61% of the working age population in England finds it difficult to understand health and wellbeing information (Public 
Health England and The Institute of Health Equity, 2015). Low levels of health literacy impact significantly upon a 
person’s ability to manage long-term conditions, make informed healthy lifestyle choices, and keep to medication 
regimes. 
 
When high quality health information is provided to patients and their family members, there is a positive impact on 
service utilisation, patients’ experience and health behaviour (Patient Information Forum, 2013). Engaging patients and 
the public is a key priority for the NHS in England, as a means to support people to stay healthy and make informed 
choices about their treatment (NHS England, 2014).  Equipping people with knowledge about their own condition means 
they experience better quality care and improved wellbeing and ensures that the healthcare system makes better use of 
resources (NHS England, 2017).

3. Methodology 

3.1 Study design 
This study was designed and conducted by a clinician-led team, with academic research support from the School of 
Medicine, University of Liverpool and the Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University. 
Additionally, advice and support were received from the Research Design Service North West. The study was conducted 
in the critical care unit at Wirral University Teaching Hospital (WUTH) NHS Foundation Trust. 
 
Ethics approval was granted by the NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) and the WUTH Research Department. 
 
The study had a three phase design (Figure 1).  
 

 
Figure 1: The phases of the study 
 

● Phase 1: Identify the knowledge requirements of critical care staff, patients and their family members 
● Phase 2: Design and implement a knowledge mobilisation model for a critical care environment 
● Phase 3: Evaluate the knowledge mobilisation model and estimate the ROI of implementing the model  

 

3.2 Participant groups 
The study had two participant groups: 
 
Participant group 1 - Critical care staff: Clinically-trained staff working in the critical care unit at Wirral University 
Teaching Hospital (WUTH) NHS Foundation Trust.  Staffing levels fluctuated throughout the study period, but when 



14 
 

recruitment began there were approximately 12 consultants, 20 doctors and 100 nurses (132 in total) working in the 
critical care unit. 
 
Participant group 2 - Critical care patients and family members: Adults who had been admitted, or who had a family 
member admitted to the critical care unit at Wirral University Teaching Hospital (WUTH) NHS Foundation Trust. Patients 
and their family members were excluded from the study if they met the following criteria:  

● Were deemed by staff to be not appropriate to participate, for example, were experiencing delirium 
● Had dementia or other neurological disorders  
● Had expected adverse outcomes 
● Were subsequently re-admitted to the hospital (established during phone contact) 
● In total, 25 patients and 20 family members were recruited for the qualitative aspect of the study (interviews 

and focus groups). 

3.3 Measures  
In phase 3 the knowledge mobilisation model was evaluated against a series of measures derived from Brettle et al 
(2016) and the Knowledge for Healthcare Value and Impact Toolkit (Health Education England).  
 
Outcome measures were: 

● Updating knowledge and skills 
● Service development/delivery 
● Improved quality of care 
● Advice to patient/carer 
● Improved patient care experience 
● Increased patient involvement/shared decision making 
● Improved access to patient information 
● Cost savings and return on investment 

3.4 Analysis 
All individual interviews and focus groups were recorded using a digital recorder, which was transcribed verbatim by the 
study researcher in preparation of thematic analysis. To provide anonymity all participants were given a randomised 
study number known only to the researcher, with other identifying information, (for example names) being redacted 
from the transcripts.    

Thematic analysis was used to identify and describe ideas emerging from the data. The process of coding was 
undertaken in 6 phases as outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006): 

I. Data familiarisation; is achieved by reading and re-reading the transcripts. 
II. Creating initial codes; simply put a code is when a complete thought has been identified as containing 

information about a particular topic. It is a way of organising the data you have collected into the relevant 
points. The ‘code’ is the topic the thought relates to. For example “I didn’t know we had a library” includes 
information about knowledge about the library as well as library user information. A code does not have to 
come from a complete sentence, it can be part of a sentence as well. Each complete thought from the 
transcripts is given a ‘code’ based upon the topic contained within that thought. 



15 
 

III. Identifying themes within codes; the analysis will now consist of a large amount of codes. The codes are then 
organised together into themes. Themes essentially contain many codes which relate to a similar subject.   

IV. Reviewing themes; the themes are then reviewed and reorganised. Some themes are removed as they don’t 
have enough supporting evidence. Other themes are joined together as the information they contain is very 
similar. Each theme should be distinct. 

V. Defining themes; themes are then organised into a broader story and how they relate to each other. Often 
larger themes will include smaller themes (called subthemes) to ensure that themes reflect how diverse 
information can be related to each other. 

VI. Writing a final report; to provide the information is an accessible and informative way for others. 

 The coding of the data was undertaken by the project research associates and with support and verification of 
interpretation from the project management team. 

The data captured in staff questionnaires from study phases one and three provided ordinal data which was used for 
frequency analyses. Respondent total varied across questions as some staff chose to omit answering some questions. 

The data from telephone interviews provided both ordinal data and qualitative data. This data was reviewed and 
interpreted in line with the focus group data to investigate similarities or differences within group (patients discharged 
over the duration of the research study) and between group (between the patients/family in the nationwide focus 
groups).

4. Phase 1: Identifying knowledge requirements 
Phase 1 identified the knowledge requirements of critical care staff, patients and family members using quantitative 
(questionnaires) and qualitative (interviews) methods. 
  

4.1 Data collection methods for critical care staff 

4.1.1 Questionnaire 
Questionnaires (Appendix 1) were used in phase 1 to capture the views of critical care staff.   
 
Staff members were asked to indicate their agreement, using a Likert scale, with a series of statements on the ways that 
knowledge was discovered, discussed and applied in the critical care department. Respondents were given the option to 
leave contact information to indicate that they wished to participate in interviews. Questionnaire data was entered for 
analysis and participants were given randomised numbers. The details of respondents were kept separately and only 
known to the researcher, thus anonymity of responses was maintained.   
 
Recruitment was conducted by the researcher (SK) on the critical care unit using posters, information displayed in staff 
areas, requests at meetings and training days, direct requests from the researcher during working hours or by 
voluntarily completing form made available in the staff room. A participant information sheet was provided (Appendix 3) 
and consent implied by completion of the questionnaire.   

4.1.2 Interviews and focus groups 
Interview data was captured to triangulate and provide greater depth to the data gathered from questionnaires.  Some 
staff members may have participated in both the questionnaire and interview, though numbers are unknown due to the 
anonymity of questionnaires.  Recruitment was conducted by the researcher (SK) on the critical care unit using posters, 
information displayed in staff areas, requests at meetings and training days, direct requests from the researcher during 
working hours. A participant information sheet (Appendix 3) was provided and consent was obtained (Appendix 4). All 
interviews were conducted in the hospital. Interviews were semi-structured with 10 prompt questions (Appendix 2). 
Consideration was made that all staff groups (doctors, nurses and allied health professionals) were represented. Data 
collection ended once saturation of themes from staff interviews was reached. 
 
The questionnaire and interview and focus group schedule were designed to guide the development of a knowledge 
mobilisation model, including the activities requiring library support, the format and method of support delivery and the 
perceptions of library and knowledge support.   
 
Data was collected from 98 members of critical care staff (75% of all staff in the critical care department): 

● 63 completed questionnaires (collected between March to May 2016): 46 nurses, 15 doctors, 2 Allied Health 
Professionals  

● 15 staff individual interviews (conducted between April to July 2016): 10 nurses, 4 doctors, 1 pharmacist; 
● 20 participants (18 nurses, 2 consultants) took part in 4 staff group interviews (between May to June 2016)

4.2 Data collection methods for patients and family 

4.2.1 Interviews and focus groups 
Patients and family members were recruited by the research team in the critical care unit during their critical care stay 
and participated in an individual or focus group following discharge. Additional participants (n=4) were recruited via 
ICUSteps, a critical care charity; an advert was placed on the ICUSteps research participation database.  
 
The interview schedule (Appendix 6) was designed to establish the knowledge requirements of the patient and family 
member during a stay in critical care, including type of support, format and timing.  While this data did not inform the 
knowledge mobilisation model directly, it provided context for the research team. All participants received the 
participant information sheet (Appendix 5) and signed the informed consent form (Appendix 4) prior to being 
interviewed. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
Data was collected from 45 patients and family members in total. 

● 20 participants from 2 focus group (conducted in November 2016) consisting of patients (n=10) and family 
members (n=10) 

● 25 interviews (conducted between October 2016 and February 2018), consisting of patients (n=15) and family 
members (n=10) 
 

4.3 Findings 
 
Data obtained in phase 1 established the knowledge requirements of critical care staff, patients and family members.  
Questionnaire responses and themes identified in interviews and focus groups were triangulated to ensure the validity

of the responses. Interviews were audio- recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The 
research team used thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 2006). 
 

4.3.1 The knowledge requirements of critical care staff 
Critical care staff required knowledge to be: 

● Available to support all aspects of care; 
● Visible and accessible to everyone; 
● Available through multiple channels, both face-to-face and online; 
● Discussed and shared between colleagues. 

 

4.3.2 Knowledge support was required for all aspects of care 
This finding was identified in phase 1 questionnaire data.  Staff expressed a clear desire for knowledge to support all 
aspects of care, from making clinical decisions to discussions with the patient.  Over 90% of staff agreed that having 
access to knowledge improved their decision-making and improved their communication with patients and family. 
 
More broadly, knowledge was also required by staff to support long-term service delivery; 95% agreed that they 
required support for service developments. 
 
Interview data reinforced the need for staff to feel well-informed, particularly when communicating with patients: 

“It’s good for the families to hear us explaining things and you can say, it’s been shown scientifically that if we do 
this... it’s going to be for their benefit. As long as you know what the most current things are.” (Nurse) 

 

4.3.3 Knowledge support needs to be visible, accessible and available to everyone 
 
Staff wanted knowledge to be easy to find, easy to understand and easy to share.  Despite a desire and willingness to 
discover new knowledge, often lack of time, pressure on resources and limited experience in knowledge-seeking were 
factors that prevented this. 
 
Over half of staff members (54%) agreed that evidence-based practice was currently supported by the library service.  
However, it was clear that there was an opportunity to raise awareness about the range of services provided: 
 

“Yeah you see I don’t know the complete thing about what the library service does. I know what it does…the 
books, but there’s a lot of other things they do don’t they?” (Nurse) 

 
As is common in many NHS Trusts, the library was situated in a separate building in the hospital, which was considered a 
barrier:  
 



19 
 

“…and it’s physically going over [to the library], because we just don’t…if you’ve got twenty minutes…you’re not 
going to do that.” (Nurse) 

 
Some staff also expressed anxiety about approaching the library service for support, and felt inexperienced in finding 
and sharing knowledge:   

 
“…you’re frightened to go to the library...Because you think ‘oh no they’re going to think I’m silly and I can’t do 
things and I should be doing that.’” (Nurse) 

 
Staff needed knowledge to enhance all aspects of the care they provided to patients and it needed to be easy for them 
to do this within the limitations of time and resources.   
 

4.3.4 Knowledge should be available through multiple channels 
 
Critical care staff work shifts that span all 24 hours of the day, and had individual preferences for accessing knowledge.  
A large majority of staff (95%) wanted knowledge support to be provided in person.  However, many also searched 
online to find up-to-date knowledge to support their work.  Many used online search engines such as Google as a 
starting point, and some nurses used the Cheshire and Mersey Adult Critical Care Network website (www.cmccn.nhs.uk) 
that provided up-to-date guidelines and other procedural-related information.  Some methods of communication to 
reach all members of staff were already established, including noticeboards, department-wide emails and groups on 
social media such as Facebook and What’s App.  Using multiple communication channels across the team of 132 staff 
presented the best opportunity to disseminate knowledge. 
 
Interview data reinforced the need for knowledge to be provided through multiple channels and in different formats: 

“If we could have the librarian on the unit for a couple of hours…go round each patient research what they’ve 
got, stick it in their notes or you know ask the nurses what do they want, or the doctors or the pharmacists.” 
(Nurse) 

“I prefer to initially do it myself, so going looking on the internet if I can’t find it then I’ll go and speak to someone 
who’s more expert in that area.” (Consultant) 

 

4.3.5 Discussing and sharing knowledge with colleagues was desired 
 
The evidence-base in critical care is complex and often conflicting.  Staff relied heavily on the experience of their 
colleagues to inform decision-making and welcomed opportunities to discuss patients' conditions and treatment with 
each other.  Interpersonal relationships between staff were highly valued and were used as a vehicle to exchange 
knowledge.  Staff welcomed the opportunity for peer-to-peer learning and discussions; most wanted knowledge support 
to be provided in person (95%) and in education sessions (85%).  Peer-to-peer learning was embedded in existing ways 
of working; nurses shared both verbal and written information with each other, often at the patient bedside.  

http://www.cmccn.nhs.uk/


20 
 

Consultants and allied health professionals gained information from colleagues in other specialities, particularly when 
dealing with difficult cases:   
 

“I think you can get an awful lot of information talking to colleagues or you know, both within your own specialty 
or other specialties and that’s done in the workplace, that’s face-to-face, that may be in a formal MDT 
[multidisciplinary team], it may be while you’re doing a theatre list and you talk to your surgeon and you talk 
about a case”. (Consultant) 
 

Knowledge was most likely to be shared across staff groups during the daily ward rounds, though some felt this was not 
the best opportunity for learning, given the urgency of patient care. Lack of time and resources meant that many nurses 
relied on peers (senior nurses and nurse educators) to cascade knowledge to them.   
 
In order to meet these needs and nurture a culture of evidence based practice, a model of knowledge mobilisation 
would need to support all aspects of care; be flexible, visible and easily accessible to staff; provide opportunities for 
peer-to-peer learning complemented by online sources of knowledge; raise awareness of the support available from the 
clinical librarian, and be supportive of staff with limited experience of knowledge-seeking.   

 
 

4.3.6 The knowledge requirements of critical care patients and their families 
 
Critical care patients and their families wanted knowledge about their condition and treatment that was: 

● Primarily delivered via the bedside nurse; 
● Repeated and reinforced at appropriate milestones of care; 
● In multiple formats (both verbal and paper); 
● Complemented by their own knowledge in the form of photographs or diaries.  

 

4.3.7 The bedside nurse was the main source of knowledge 
 
The nurse’s role in providing daily updates on patient prognosis and goals, as well as offering comfort, was highly valued 
by the patient and family.  The constant presence of the bedside nurse offered reassurance; several patients described 
the bedside nurse as a ‘friend’: 
   

“…they’re with you for twelve hours, aren’t they? So I kind of was chatting to them about them and me, you 
know so you do strike up a bit of a…in inverted commas ‘a friendship’ with them…They’ve got time to speak to 
you about those sorts of things because they’re there.” (Patient) 
  

Patients and family members expressed a huge degree of trust in the knowledge imparted by nurses and doctors.  This 
level of trust was evident in the view that in emergency situations patients and family members did not feel they needed 
to be involved in decision-making.  All patients and family members were happy to defer to the expertise of the staff to 
ensure that the best possible care was given:  

  



21 
 

“I was just in their hands and just totally trusted that it was going to be the right decision whatever they did, for 
whatever it was… Actually I just want to say ‘well you’re the doctor…you decide.” (Patient) 

 
The bedside nurse was viewed as being approachable, reassuring, knowledgeable and trustworthy, and their close 
presence meant that they became a preferred source of knowledge for the patient and family. 
 

4.3.8 Knowledge needs to be repeated and reinforced at appropriate milestones of care 
 
Patients and family members often experienced barriers to communication while in critical care, related to their 
condition and the environment.  Delirium, hearing loss and general confusion meant that many patients needed 
information to be repeated: 
 

“I needed it repeating again and again. Yeah, maybe at the beginning and again and then maybe on the 
discharge, a nice big letter. I needed it again and again.” (Patient) 

 
Severe disturbances such as hallucinations and nightmares affected the ability to retain and recall knowledge.  Family 
members felt anxious and were keen for their understanding of their relative’s condition to be repeated and reinforced 
by staff.  
 
Both patients and family members felt it was important to receive information at the right time, when approaching 
milestones in the care of the patient:   
 

“You want to know immediately. What the immediate plan is. You know over the next day or so, and then 
depending on what happens to that plan, you want to know what their next plan is. You want information 
immediately about what the initial plan is.” (Patient) 

 
Two milestones were identified: firstly, when the patient was moved from critical care to a ward and, secondly, when 
the patient returned home from the hospital.  When being discharged from hospital, many felt reassured by the 
discharge leaflet that provided additional information about the follow-up clinic and after-care: 
 

“… when you come out ‘ this might happen, this might happen’ so actually, although I thought ‘I don’t really 
want to read it all and know what might happen’ it was quite nice for example when my hair started falling out 
three months later, I looked in the book and it said ‘this might happen’ and I thought ‘ahh ok that’s what it’s 
going to be, I’m not going to panic about it’, because that’s one of the things that can happen. So that was a 
brilliant piece of information.” (Patient) 

 
The delivery and timing of knowledge was important to the patient and the family; having the right knowledge to hand 
at the right time reduced any additional anxiety or confusion.   

 

4.3.9 Knowledge was preferred in multiple formats 
 



22 
 

Patients and families had individual preferences for the format of knowledge.  Knowledge that was obtained at 
milestones of care (e.g. discharge from the hospital) was preferred in paper format, with a preference for day-to-day 
knowledge-sharing with staff to be verbal: 
 

“I think to start giving people pieces of paper. I think it sort of almost says ‘we can’t be bothered talking to you, 
read that’…Definitely. Human face to face for information. I don’t really think you want to be given bits of 
paper.” (Patient) 

 
Many expressed a need to retain paper-based knowledge as a memory prompt and to be able to refer back to it when 
they were more able to absorb the information: 
 

“Being in a coma you don’t remember anything, and then the meningitis took my memory, took my hearing…all 
those things added up to not remembering yesterday. To have a paper copy of your information every time, 
would have been handy.” (Patient) 

 
One patient carried the discharge documents with them whenever they left the house, as they were worried that their 
condition could recur: 
   

“...so I kind of took those [discharge papers] everywhere with me, when I went anywhere in case we were out for 
the day, and I just thought ‘ooh if I feel ill I’ve got my paper with me and I can then say this is what happened to 
me’…I then went back in and out a few time afterwards …and got more discharge papers…” (Patient) 
 

During their stay in critical care, the personal nature of verbal exchanges was appreciated, while paper-based sources of 
knowledge served an important purpose as a record of the patient’s illness.  Many felt that it was important to keep this 
documentation for future reference or recollection.   
   

4.3.10 The patient and family as a source of knowledge 
 
During their stay in critical care, several patients and family members created new knowledge by taking photographs or 
keeping diaries.  Nursing staff encouraged the use of diaries and many also wrote in them.  Both patients and family 
members felt that documenting the experience of critical care was of great importance for two reasons. Firstly, it 
allowed family members and staff to keep up-to-date with the patient’s progress.  Secondly, looking back at 
photographs and diaries supported recovery from critical illness: 
  

“After the event, there were three weeks of my life that were totalling missing and I needed to put it together 
again, both in a technical way as a nurse would do and in a personal way.  So the nurse’s side would have been 
brilliant for me…I got all my notes, but they’re very technical.” (Patient) 
 

This new knowledge created by the patient or family member became an alternative and complementary record to the 
often impersonal medical notes, and was captured by family members as a way of telling the story of the experience of 
their loved one: 
 



23 
 

“I think it’s right with the diaries, when you’ve got your medical notes it’s all medical lingo, but with the diaries 
it’s more of a personal so ‘oh you sat up today xx’ or ‘better today’.” (Patient) 
  

The findings of phase 1 of the study demonstrated that the role of the bedside nurse is pivotal in ensuring that that 
knowledge requirements of the patient and family are met.  A combination of verbal and paper-based knowledge was 
preferred, repeated frequently and ideally provided at specific milestones.  A desire to document the significance of the 
critical care experience was expressed, and this was done by creating new knowledge in the form of diaries and 
photographs, tailored to the preferences of the individual patient.   



24 
 

5. Phase 2: Design and implementation of a knowledge 
mobilisation model 

In phase 2 a model of knowledge mobilisation was designed and implemented following findings from phase 1. 

5.1 Designing the model 
In phase 1, findings from questionnaires, interviews and focus groups with critical care staff highlighted that staff 
required knowledge to be: 

● Available to support all aspects of care 
● Visible and accessible to everyone 
● Available through multiple channels, both face-to-face and online 
● Discussed and shared between colleagues to encourage a culture of evidence based practice. 

 
Staff found seeking and applying knowledge to be challenging for many reasons including lack of time, pressure on 
resources and limited experience of knowledge-seeking, therefore the model was designed to be as flexible as possible 
in response.  Phase 1 findings also demonstrated that the model needed to raise awareness of the range of ways that 
the clinical librarian could provide support.  To do this it was necessary for the clinical librarian to work alongside staff, 
develop personal relationships with them and demonstrate the value of having a clinical librarian in the team in an 
informal and approachable way.  These findings informed the design and development of a knowledge and mobilisation 
model that is outlined further in this section. 

5.2 Implementing the model 
The knowledge mobilisation model was implemented for a 15 month period between September 2016 and December 
2017. Delivery of the model was led by the clinical librarian with support from the wider library team. 
 
15 hours per week of clinical librarian time was dedicated to delivering the model. The time was split into 4 x 3.75 hour 
sessions across different days and times of the week to enable contact with as many staff members as possible. No desk 
space in the critical care department was available, so the clinical librarian worked in the critical care unit itself, working 
at the nurses station, and participated in ward-based activities, such as ward round, when required. A laptop and iPad 
were available to the clinical librarian to facilitate access to online resources and email. In addition to being present on 
the critical care unit, the clinical librarian attended departmental team meetings, case-based discussions, educational 
activities (e.g. Journal Club) and was integrated into inductions for new staff (both nurses and junior doctors). 
 
A bright yellow polo t-shirt was worn by the clinical librarian to identify job title and enhance visibility in the department. 
Library-branded pens were distributed by the clinical librarian to promote the service. 
The model comprised of a range of activities selected based on the data collected in phase 1 as well as practical 
considerations, such as resource availability and working hours.   
 
At the outset of the 15 month period, the model consisted of the following activities: 
 
Pop-up Library: Specific, advertised days and hours each week when the clinical librarian was physically present in 
critical care, talking with staff, answering questions and offering knowledge-related support.  Data collected in phase 1 



25 
 

identified that staff lacked time and resources to access knowledge support, so care was taken to ensure that the clinical 
librarian was visible and accessible in the unit. The clinical librarian made time to get to know the staff, joining them in 
the break room and at the bedside, to build a trusting relationship with staff.   
 

Book box: A small collection of relevant book titles selected by the clinical 
librarian for staff to read, kept in a departmental office. This overcame the 
physical barriers of attending the library. As the titles were handpicked for the 
staff, it ensured that the information was relevant to the staff needs 
encouraging information seeking.  
  
Academic study support: Scheduled, advertised training sessions on topics 
including academic writing, information searching skills, critical appraisal skills, 
referencing and proofreading were provided. These sessions were primarily 
aimed at nursing staff undertaking academic study, and were designed to 
nurture confidence levels and encourage knowledge-seeking behaviour.  
 
Evidence searching support: A systematic and thorough review of the 
evidence was undertaken by the clinical librarian on topics requested by 
critical care staff.  This service, although previously available from the library 
service, was delivered in the critical care environment, with search questions 

being picked up during ward rounds, at the bedside, at departmental meetings and during conversations with staff.  This 
embedded approach to evidence support was designed to save staff time, overcome resource limitations and encourage 
an evidence-based culture across all staff groups in the department. 

 
Noticeboard: A dedicated noticeboard in the critical care corridor was obtained to display details of upcoming training 
sessions, advertised pop-up library times, and provided paper-based copies of material available online, such as journal 
articles.  A photograph of the clinical librarian and contact details were clearly displayed.  The content of the 
noticeboard was designed to be accessible and inclusive to all staff groups, particularly those who lacked confidence in 
assessing online sources of knowledge, and those who worked night shifts and wouldn’t necessarily meet the clinical 
librarian on the unit. 
 
Journal club support: A consultant-led departmental journal club was held each month, in which junior doctors would 
take it in turn to present and discuss a recently published research paper. To enhance the existing format, library 
support was offered to presenters in identifying, appraising and presenting suitable studies. This activity was 
traditionally an educational opportunity for doctors, despite an open invitation to all staff.  The clinical librarian 
encouraged nurses to attend and present, advertised journal club in advance, and following journal club shared copies 
of the research paper discussed. 
 
Online journal club: Phase 1 findings identified that many members of staff wanted more opportunities for discussions 
with colleagues.  Many were unable to attend departmental activities, so it was hoped that a virtual journal club, hosted 
on the Facebook group, would complement the existing face to face journal club.  A research paper was selected by the 
clinical librarian with input and suggestions from staff, who were invited to read the paper and contribute to the online 
discussion at a time convenient to them.   
 



26 
 

Facebook group: In response to the desire expressed in phase 1 findings for peer-to-peer learning opportunities, a 
private, online forum moderated by the clinical librarian was created.  The purpose of this group was to share 
knowledge and learning between colleagues, across all staff groups.  By the end of phase 2 the group had over 50 
members. Facebook was chosen as the preferred platform as many staff were already using a similar Facebook group to 
arrange shift swaps and organise social events.   
 

5.3 Refining the model 
The knowledge mobilisation model was refined over a 15-month period in response to observations by the clinical 
librarian and informal suggestions from critical care staff.  Most activities were continued, a number were added, some 
were adapted and some were removed from the model.   
 
Questions of the month: Following discussions with the journal club lead that journal club offered an opportunity for 
wider discussions around evidence based practice, ‘Questions of the month’ was introduced in month 3 of the model. 
‘Questions of the month’ - one-page, quick reference evidence summaries - were presented by the clinical librarian at 
journal club to prompt a wider discussion. Topics related to patients or conditions recently observed in the critical care 
unit were selected, such as Management of bronchopleural fistula and Immunotherapy in critical care, so that they were 
directly relevant to clinical practice. 
 
Newsletters: Requests from senior nurses and doctors led to the clinical librarian coordinating and publishing a monthly, 
critical care newsletter from month 2 of the model containing news, events and features from critical care staff.  This led 
to additional requests from consultants for support with reformatting clinical governance updates into a “Learning 
Lessons” newsletter.  

  
Facebook Messenger: Due to the clinical librarian’s presence on 
Facebook and visibility in posting to the Facebook group, critical 
care staff began using Facebook Messenger to ask questions and 
make requests. It was an easy and convenient way for clinical 
care staff to contact the clinical librarian, in particular for those 
who worked night shifts.  Interestingly this method of 
communication was not advertised by the clinical librarian and 
was initiated by critical care staff, predominantly nurses. 
  
Evidence Bites: One-page summaries of the evidence on specific 
topics, called ‘Evidence Bites’, were produced by the clinical 
librarian from month 10 of the model following observations that 
staff would prefer a shorter, more accessible summary of the 
evidence.  Evidence Bites highlighted key messages in a digestible 
and accessible format and were disseminated to staff in paper 
and electronic formats.  
 
One-to-one training: Regular, scheduled training sessions on 
evidence searching, critical appraisal and academic writing were 
offered to staff from the outset of the model being implemented. 



27 
 

Once those staff who were interested had attended, demand for scheduled sessions dwindled, so from month 4 training 
was offered on an individual and ad hoc basis.   
 
Pop Up Library: Pop Up Library scheduled sessions ceased after month 4 as demand for support spread across the whole 
working week. 

 

  



28 
 

6. Phase 3: Evaluating the model and measuring return on 
investment 

6.1 Data collection methods 

6.1.1 Questionnaires 
In phase 3, critical care staff were asked to complete questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the knowledge 
mobilisation model and explore the potential ROI.   
 
A questionnaire that evaluated the knowledge mobilisation model collected data from all critical care staff (Appendix 7).  
Staff members were asked to indicate their agreement, using a Likert scale, with a series of statements on the impact of 
the model. Respondents were given the option to leave contact information to indicate that they wished to participate 
in interviews. Questionnaire data was entered for analysis and participants were given randomised numbers. The details 
of respondents were kept separately and only known to the researcher, thus anonymity of responses was maintained.  
Recruitment was conducted by the researcher (SK) on the critical care unit using posters, information displayed in staff 
areas, requests at meetings and training days, direct requests from the researcher during working hours or by 
voluntarily completing form made available in the staff room. A participant information sheet (Appendix 3) was provided 
and consent implied by completion of the questionnaire.   
 
Interview data was captured to triangulate and provide greater depth to the data gathered from questionnaires.  Some 
staff members may have participated in both the questionnaire and interview, though numbers are unknown due to the 
anonymity of questionnaires.  Recruitment for interviews was conducted by the researcher (SK) on the critical care unit 
using posters, information displayed in staff areas, requests at meetings and training days, direct requests from the 
researcher during working hours. A participant information sheet (Appendix 3) was provided and consent was obtained 
(Appendix 4). All interviews were conducted in the hospital. Interviews were semi-structured with 10 prompt questions 
(Appendix 8). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006).  
 
Questionnaire data was collected from 36 respondents (27 nurses; 5 doctors; 4 allied health professionals).  Data from 
questionnaires were triangulated with data from 14 staff interviews (12 nurses, 2 consultants) and 2 focus groups (8 
nurses). An additional 24 interviews with staff who had used the knowledge mobilisation model were undertaken for the 
ROI analysis (see section Return on Investment analysis). 

6.2 Most used activities 
Findings from phase 3 questionnaires indicated that the activities that were most used by critical care staff were the 
noticeboard, journal club, the newsletter(s) and Pop Up Library [Table 1].

Table 1. Usage of activities from the knowledge mobilisation model 
 
Noticeboard: The noticeboard was the most utilised aspect of the model, used by 59% of respondents. Following a 
request from a member of staff during consultation, a noticeboard outside the staff break room was adopted and used 
to promote library support. The noticeboard enabled a low cost, low tech communication channel with staff that was 
accessible to all staff and visible in an area of the department with good footfall.  
 
Journal club: Journal club was the second most used activity (43% of respondents).  During phase 1 data collection it 
became apparent that there was a misunderstanding between staff regarding who could attend journal club. The 
research team took great care to publicise the meetings to all staff and encourage attendance. By the end of the study, 
although attendance at journal club was still predominantly by doctors, more nurses were attending and participating: 
  

“…the journal club…it has been publicised a little bit better... it’s good to see that nurses are getting more 
involved and that they are getting invited into them. And that’s been helpful.” (Nurse) 
  

Newsletters: Following requests from staff, a ‘Lessons Learned’ newsletter and a staff newsletter were developed and 
disseminated across the department.  The ‘Lessons Learned’ newsletter highlighted learning from safety incidents while 
the staff newsletter shared news around new staff, staff achievements and current projects.  Newsletters were one of 



30 
 

the most used aspects of the model (43%) and both were developed in partnership with senior critical care staff 
including matron and consultants. Newsletters were shared on the staff noticeboard, in the break room and via the 
Facebook group.  
 
Pop Up Library: The Pop Up Library was used by 37% of respondents, was developed in response to data from phase 1 
which identified several barriers that were faced by critical care staff in accessing knowledge, including time and 
resources.  It meant the clinical librarian was embedded in the daily workings of the critical care department.  Interview 
data illustrated that the Pop Up Library made the biggest impact on staff; when interviewed, many discussed using 
library services simply due to the on-unit presence of the librarian: 
 
Other activities: Support for academic study was received by several of the interviewees who reported that it supported 
their studies and improved their confidence: 
  

“Like I say I think it is good for …especially staff you know who are doing a course and haven’t done one for a 
while. I think it takes some of that anxiety away…” (Nurse) 

  
Evidence search support was provided to staff for a variety of purposes: to support academic pursuits, to expand 
knowledge on a clinical topic, to support departmental activities such as the newsletter, or to help improve services.   
 
The Facebook group and online journal club were discussed interchangeably in staff interviews. Most staff members 
discussed a wider impact that had been felt offline. Several staff described how discussions occurring in the Facebook 
group led to increased peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing offline. There appeared to still be issues surrounding a lack of 
confidence in the staff, which impacted their willingness to post within these groups: 
  

“It was reaching more people than it looked like it was, because everyone feels a bit like ‘oooh’ (mimics hiding).” 
(Nurse) 
  
“…she started to do a Facebook group and that was the biggest thing that I found helped. Critical care have got 
their own group and she would put articles on of interest. And that was what was very good about things. And 
then it caused discussions. So I found that very good…Yeah there was a lot on the ward, but there was a couple of 
things that was brought up…but anyway it caused people to start talking about things.” (Nurse) 

  
By the end of the study, there had been a shift to a greater awareness amongst staff about the availability of the 
physical library space in the hospital; only 11% of respondents were unaware of the support available from the library at 
the end of phase 3.  The presence of the Pop Up Library may explain these findings; simply put, staff no longer had to go 
to the library, the library came to them: 
  

“I can speak for me and say that I asked (librarian), whilst she was actually on the unit, for research… So, she was 
able to get me all the research, all the latest research, without me having to go trawling out, she was just there, 
immediately, on-site. So if found that actually very, very useful. So she was able to give me a list of all the latest 
research.” (Nurse) 

  
The activities most used by staff - noticeboard, journal club, newsletters and Pop Up Library - were low-tech approaches 
to mobilising knowledge, reflecting a culture where staff were more confident and willing to share knowledge face-to-
face than online.  The most-used activities share some interesting characteristics: they were integrated into existing 



31 
 

initiatives in the department, and required minimal behaviour change by staff.  Journal club and newsletters were 
activities that were developed alongside members of staff, often senior and influential individuals; this undoubtedly 
encouraged usage.  Journal club and Pop Up Library are highly relational activities that involve face-to-face discussion 
between colleagues.  Knowledge was more readily and successfully exchanged from peer-to-peer rather than by 
department-wide initiatives, highlighting the importance of individual relationships and trust between colleagues.  This 
helps us to uncover why these aspects of the model were most successful: those activities which reflected existing 
culture and behaviour, those that were merged with existing departmental activities, and those that were championed 
by key influencers in the department. 
 

6.3 Findings of the evaluation 
 
Findings demonstrated that the knowledge mobilisation model:  

● supported staff learning and education; 
● improved the quality of care; 
● nurtured an evidence-based culture; 
● generated a positive financial value.  

 

6.3.1 The model supported staff learning and education 
 
Critical care is a unique specialty and requires staff to be highly trained.  The knowledge mobilisation model supported 
learning and education across all staff groups; from discussions about the evidence base in journal club to nurses 
pursuing academic qualifications.  Phase 3 questionnaire data illustrated that 59% of staff agreed that the model 
supported the delivery of education / training and 37% reported that their knowledge and skills had been updated as a 
result of the model.  

 
Since the clinical librarian was embedded in the team there was a reduced need for staff to leave their workplace to 
access study support.   
 
Critical care staff were required to demonstrate their continuing professional development and comply with a range of 
standards from regulatory and professional bodies, including the General Medical Council (GMC) and the Nursing and 
Midwifery Council (NMC).  47% of respondents agreed that the knowledge mobilisation model enabled them to comply 
with regulatory and professional standards.   
 
All staff were expected to continue learning during their career in critical care, often this meant pursuing an academic 
qualification.  For nurses in particular this move into academia was a source of uncertainty and anxiety.  The responsive 
presence of the clinical librarian ensured that many of these nurses were supported to achieve their qualification. 
 
The embedded nature of the clinical librarian role meant that this support was provided alongside day-to-day working, 
sometimes at the bedside.  The clinical librarian was also invited to multi-disciplinary team meetings and journal club 
where knowledge-related discussions could be encouraged.   
 



32 
 

6.3.2 The model improved the quality of care 
 
Over half of respondents (52%) agreed that the model supported the quality of care.   The clinical librarian was 
approached to support individual instances of patient care, particularly by nursing staff: 
 

“We had a Jehovah’s Witness patient, do you remember? And there were aspects of her care and about blood, 
and taking arterial blood gasses and we involved (librarian) in that…I think then we were able to get further 
information then, which then prompted us to get one of the Jehovah’s witness family in, and we had a talk with 
the Jehovah’s Witnesses. So I’m sure one of the staff would have asked her about that. And we were given 
handouts and stuff so that we can read.” (Nurse) 

 
Critical care is a fast-paced specialty in which treatments and guidance can frequently change; the evidence base can be 
conflicting and decisions about patient care are complex.  The model encouraged discussions about the evidence base 
between colleagues: 
   

“I think the model certainly informed the care a lot better. I think there are differences of opinion between 
consultants, and I think the model helped inform what to do.” (Junior doctor) 
 

Staff reported that the knowledge mobilisation model helped them to follow clinical guidelines (54%), meet quality 
standards (49%) and revise care pathways (47%), thus supporting staff to navigate the complexities of decision-making: 
 

“The clinical librarian saved me a lot of time because I needed someone who could get me the latest guidelines, 
the latest evidence, and access it very quickly.” (Nurse) 
 

When faced with pressures on their time and resources, critical care staff were able to utilise the skills of the clinical 
librarian in providing the evidence to support the development of guidelines and care pathways: 
 

“I remember writing a guideline about high-dose insulin, and the clinical librarian provided me with a big list of 
abstracts from literature searches, which was actually very useful. That alone saved me a lot of time.” (Junior 
doctor) 

 

6.3.3 The model nurtured an evidence-based culture 
 

As well as supporting educational activities such as journal club, the model had an indirect impact on a wider culture of 
evidence-based practice.  As a result of the knowledge mobilisation model there was a more inclusive atmosphere 
regarding meetings, with nurse attendance significantly increased and a greater openness generally amongst staff: 
  

“Making sure that the emails are going out to all the nursing staff, that they’re invited…There has been nurses 
asking me specific things ‘well actually we are doing teaching on this, try to come along, on Friday’. I suppose 
we’re trying…we’re working on that if you like. I think there’s going to be a cultural change in medicine over the 
next…you know it’s already happening big time and I think it will continue to happen, so level the playing field a 
little bit more hopefully.” (Consultant) 

  



33 
 

With the clinical librarian working in close proximity with the critical care team, visible in the department, at meetings 
and known by many of the staff, the role acted as a prompt for discussions about learning, invited questions to be asked, 
and facilitated discussions about the evidence base both face-to-face and online: 
 

“The clinical librarian’s presence keeps people thinking, ‘why are we doing it this way, and are there other ways 
of doing this?” (Nurse) 

 

6.4 Return on Investment (ROI) analysis 
 
Return on investment (ROI) is a type of cost-benefit analysis in which intervention costs are compared with total 
monetised benefits. Few studies have evaluated the ROI of clinical librarians in hospital settings and there appears to be 
no evidence of a standardised or validated tool for assessing ROI (Madden et al., 2016). In these few studies, outcomes 
were often chosen on an ad hoc basis depending on whether the outcomes could be measured and monetised.  
 
ROI was estimated from quantitative and qualitative data collected from a purposive sample of critical care staff who 
utilised the knowledge mobilisation model during the study period.  Participants were recruited by the researcher (NH) 
in person or by email.  All staff members in the purposive sample received a participant information sheet (Appendix 6), 
signed a consent form (Appendix 7), completed an ROI questionnaire (Appendix 8) and participated in a short interview 
of up to 30 minutes (Appendix 9). Interviews were conducted one-to-one, except for a single group interview which 
included three junior nurses (Band 5) and two senior nurses (Band 7).  Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and 
analysed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). 
 
From the qualitative and quantitative data, ROI was determined by comparing the total costs of employing a part-time 
clinical librarian with the total monetised benefits of implementing the intervention. Three ROI metrics were calculated: 

1. Net benefits = total benefits – total costs 
2. Benefit cost ratio = total benefits/total costs 
3. ROI = [(total benefits – total costs)/total costs] x 100 

 
The total costs of implementing the knowledge mobilisation model were calculated from the employer perspective. Only 
direct costs to the employer, such as salary and equipment costs, were considered. Overhead costs for printing and 
telephone were minimal and not considered as additional. 
 
The total benefits were estimated from the ROI questionnaires and interviews with critical care staff, and from financial 
information provided by administrative staff on the unit. Based on previous research studies (Weightman & Williamson, 
2005) and from content analysis of interviews, the following outcome categories emerged: 

1)   Time savings for critical care staff 
2)   Professional development for nurses 
3)   Improved patient care 

 
The logic model below illustrates the underlying relationships between the inputs (i.e., funding), outputs (i.e., activities), 
outcomes (i.e., benefits), and impact of the clinical librarian intervention: 



34 
 

  
Figure 2: Knowledge mobilisation logic model 
 
The ROI analysis compared the total costs with the total monetised benefits of implementing the model. The ROI 
analysis indicated that for every £1 invested in the knowledge mobilisation model, a financial value of £1.18 to £3.03 
was generated in time saving, enhanced professional development and improved patient care.  
 

6.4.1 Total costs: salary and equipment costs 
Salary costs included hiring a Band 6 clinical librarian at 0.4 FTE (15 hours per week). For the 15-month intervention, 
total salary costs were £15,382 (Royal College of Nursing, 2017). 
 
Total equipment costs were £2,007, including: 

·         Laptop and accessories (£1,389) 
·         iPad and case (£535) 
·         Audio recorder (£54) 
·         Bright yellow polo T-shirts (£29) 

 
Total costs for salary and equipment were £17,389. 
 

6.4.2 Total benefits 
Total benefits of employing a clinical librarian were estimated by considering: 
 

·         Time saving for critical care nurses, junior doctors and consultants. 
·         Professional development for nurses enrolled in postgraduate training. 



35 
 

·         Improved care for patients and family members. 
  

6.4.3 Time saving to critical care staff 
After the 15-month intervention, the ROI questionnaire asked critical care staff to indicate the number of hours saved 
per month by utilising clinical librarian services. Results showed that the clinical librarian saved 1,560 hours of critical 
care staff time. Most of the time saving was claimed by nursing staff (85%) and 15% reported by junior doctors and 
consultants (Table 2). Using median hourly rate pay scales critical care staff, the value of the total time saving was 
estimated at £26,312 (Royal College of Nursing, 2017; NHS Employers, 2017).

Table 2: Time saving to critical care staff 
 
Time saving was also evident from interviews with nurses and junior doctors/consultants who utilised the model: 
 

“I remember one particular incident, where she actually researched for me. I had a HF machine going, so that’s 
something you need to be constantly there for. You can’t really go away and be looking these things up. So the 
clinical librarian enabled me to carry on with my job, while she got the information and brought it to me. I could 
read through that information while I was still caring for the patient, doing the things that I needed to do.” 
(Nurse)  



36 
 

 “The clinical librarian saved me hours and a lot of stress, because I work full-time and have small children. I 
wouldn’t have had time to sit in the library.” (Nurse) 

“When I was doing my master’s, the clinical librarian saved me time and stress. I was trying to hold down a 
fulltime job and do the course. It’s pretty tough.” (Nurse) 

 
 “It was a brilliant service, because it was so time-saving.” (Nurse) 
 
“The clinical librarian cut down on all that studying time immensely.” (Nurse) 
 
 “Without the clinical librarian, we haven’t got time to go and research, and there isn’t someone there to ask.” 
(Nurse) 
 
“With respect to time savings, the clinical librarian helped me with the clinical governance newsletter. I wrote the 
report, and she helped with the layout. She did a very good job of making it look very presentable. It did save me 
time.” (Consultant) 
 

6.4.4 Support for professional development of critical care nurses 
ROI questionnaires from critical care nurses indicated that they used the model primarily for academic study and 
professional development. 
 

6.4.4.1 Professional development support for junior nurses 
During the study, at least 50% of critical care nurses on every unit were required to hold a Postgraduate Certificate in 
Critical Care Nursing (Deacon et al., 2017). This requirement was necessary because advances in critical care nursing 
require specialised skills, in-depth knowledge and an ability to apply evidence-based knowledge to clinical practice.  
 
In this study, findings from questionnaires and interviews revealed that Band 5 nurses experienced a considerable 
amount of support from the model in completing the mandatory Postgraduate Certificate Course in Critical Care, offered 
at a nearby university. The postgraduate course consisted of three modules: Concepts of Critical Care Nursing, 
Advancing Knowledge and Skills in Critical Care Nursing, and Managing Complex Clients in Critical Care. 
 
The postgraduate course was required of all critical care nurses who worked for a minimum of 18 hours per week on the 
unit, and who cared for Level 3 patients (i.e., those requiring advanced respiratory support or monitoring for two or 
more organ systems). In addition, nurses were required to have a minimum of 12 months’ post-registration experience 
in critical care before enrolling. 
 
In 2015 and 2016, two junior nurses per year dropped out of the Postgraduate Certificate Course, costing the NHS more 
than £3,000 in pre-paid tuition (University of Chester, 2019). When the knowledge mobilisation model was implemented 
in 2017, the percentage of enrolled nurses completing the course increased from 71% to 100% (Table 2).  It is likely that 
the implementation of the model in 2017 prevented an additional two nurses from dropping out, representing a cost 
saving of £3,136 (2016 prices).

Table 3: Completion rates for Postgraduate Certificate Course in Critical Care 
 
Clinical librarian support for junior nurses enrolled in postgraduate training was also evident from the interviews: 

“Sometimes a patient would have an illness that we didn’t know much about, and the clinical librarian would get 
us an article or a piece of research that we would give to the patient and say, ‘Have a read of this, and you’ll 
learn more about what’s going on.’ And that was of great help.” (Nurse) 

 “Without the clinical librarian, I don’t think I would have even started my course, to be honest. The clinical 
librarian was invaluable to me.” (Nurse) 

“I needed help with the most basic things, my logins, how to access Athens, how to do evidence searches.” 
(Nurse) 
 
 “Oh God, I don’t think I could have done the ITU Course without her.” (Nurse) 
 
“The University says ‘you need these books for reading’, and the clinical librarian already has them, and you think 
‘great, I’ve already got everything I need’…” (Nurse) 
 

6.4.4.2 Case study: Professional development for senior nurses 
Professional development is an important part of career advancement in nursing. Frequently, nurses pursue academic 
studies alongside their clinical work. During the time when the knowledge mobilisation model was implemented, Nurse 
A was an experienced Band 6 nurse working on the critical care unit. 
 
The support offered by the knowledge mobilisation model enabled Nurse A to complete a master’s in Advanced 
Practice, progressing from Band 6 to Band 8a and resulting in a minimum pay increase of £4,803 per year (RCN, 2017) 
(Table 4). Although this pay increase does not reflect directly in cost savings to the NHS, it offers a proxy value for the 
professional development and career advancement made possible by the model.

An interview with Nurse A indicated the degree of support received from the model: 
 

“The clinical librarian helped me quite a bit with evidence searching, especially accessing journal articles and 
different databases. She reviewed my work, gave me pointers and helped support my work with better evidence. 
It was really good. If it wasn’t for her support, I wouldn’t have gone on to complete my master’s. As part of my 
course, I did a dementia module, and delirium was a big issue. Both dementia and delirium are common causes 
of cognitive impairment. The clinical librarian helped me particularly with that module, because it was quite 
difficult to find evidence. I also did a module on evidence-based research, and that was all about proning [patient 
lying face down] in intensive care for acute respiratory distress syndrome. The clinical librarian really helped me 
with that module as well. I’m a Band 6 currently, and once I’ve completed my master’s, I go to 8a. The clinical 
librarian definitely helped me get started and keep going with my career progression.” (Nurse) 

 

6.4.5 Improved care for patients and family members  
 
Critical incident technique (CIT) in healthcare measures how a specific incident contributes to improved patient 
outcomes. Using CIT, specific incidents are chosen because they are likely to illustrate a focused and accurate reflection 
of impact. Used as a valid evaluation method by organisations in health care and education, CIT is recommended as a 
‘robust’ and ‘tried and trusted method of demonstrating impact’ for research involving clinical librarian services (Brettle 
et al., 2016). 

6.4.5.1 Critical incident: Improved patient care 
During the first month of the knowledge mobilisation model (October 2016), a female patient arrived in the critical care 
unit extremely ill with an acute severe asthma attack. Upon arrival, the patient’s condition deteriorated quickly, and she 
needed emergency assistance. She was given breathing assistance via a breathing tube and ventilator. 
 
Over the next several days, the patient’s condition was closely observed by critical care staff. A bedside monitor was 
used to assess breathing, heart rate and oxygen saturation. During this time, consultants and nurses provided verbal 
information on the severity of her asthmatic attack to the patient and her husband. The clinical librarian supported the 
process with appropriate written information on the patient’s condition and the process of recovering from a traumatic 
episode. 
 
After a few days, the ventilator was removed and medication reduced. As a result, the patient experienced a sudden 
episode of delirium, including hallucinations, which caused great distress to both herself and her husband. Fortunately, 
the clinical librarian was on duty, and quickly provided her husband with relevant information on delirium. This 



39 
 

information enabled him to understand what was happening, and to feel more calm and at ease. This also enabled him 
to explain what was happening to his wife who was extremely agitated and confused. 
 
When the patient’s condition stabilised and the couple were preparing to return home, the clinical librarian provided 
information to the patient and her husband on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this information was to 
ensure that the couple were well prepared to cope with any possible recurrent anxiety, flashbacks, nightmares, 
hallucinations or negative thought patterns arising from the trauma of the asthmatic attack and delirium. 
 
In follow-up conversations with critical care staff, both the patient and her husband reported how traumatised they 
were by the experience of the patient’s acute illness and delirium, and how grateful they were for the written 
information and verbal support provided by the clinical librarian. Consequently, both the patient and her husband made 
a successful recovery without requiring any treatment for managing PTSD. 
 

6.4.5.2 Cost avoidance from preventing PTSD 
PTSD in critical illness survivors and their family members results in a high economic cost to the NHS. PTSD occurs in 
approximately 22% (one in five) of survivors of critical illness (Parker et al., 2015). Additionally, 33% (one in three) of 
family members of critical illness survivors have a high risk of developing PTSD, especially if they have been provided 
with incomplete or inadequate information (Azoulay et al., 2005).  
 
To treat PTSD, the NICE guidelines suggest 8 to 12 sessions of trauma-focused psychological treatment lasting between 
60 to 90 minutes at a cost of approximately £190 per session (Curtis & Burns, 2016). If the couple had required specialist 
treatment for PTSD, the cost would have been approximately £1,904 for 8 to 12 sessions. However, given the probability 
of requiring PTSD sessions is 22% for survivors of critical illness and 33% for family members, the cost of PTSD sessions 
for the patient and her husband was estimated at £1,047 (Table 5).

Although this case study describes one critical incident of improved patient care due to the clinical librarian intervention, 
interviews with staff suggested a potentially larger impact on patient care: 
  

“I think impact on patient care, maybe not at that point (when the intervention was implemented), but I think 
ultimately it would have had a big impact. It had only just started to be seen as a valuable resource.” (Nurse) 
 

6.4.6 Sensitivity analysis 
The monetised benefits of the knowledge mobilisation model were based on assumptions made from available 
quantitative and qualitative evidence. Sensitivity analysis investigated the robustness of these findings by considering 
changes in key assumptions and comparing the assumptions in the base case with a more conservative case to present a 
reasonable range of ROI metrics (Table 6).

6.4.7 ROI metrics: Net benefits, benefit cost ratio and return on investment 
To estimate the ROI from the employer perspective, the monetised benefits of the knowledge mobilisation model were 
compared with the total costs for both base case and conservative case scenarios (Table 7).

ROI = [(benefits - costs)/costs] x 100 103% 18% 

 Table 7: Monetised outcomes compared with total costs 
 
For both base case and conservative case scenarios, the model generated a positive financial value from time saving, 
support for professional development and improved patient care. The ROI analysis indicated that for every £1 invested 
in the knowledge mobilisation model, a financial value of £1.18 to £3.03 was generated in time saving, enhanced 
professional development and improved patient care.  
 

6.4.8 Additional non-monetised outcomes  
Findings from this ROI analysis revealed that the model produced a positive ROI. In addition, interviews with staff 
members indicate further outcomes, which were difficult to monetise, such as improved staff culture. The following 
statements were indicative: 



42 
 

 
“At the end of a ward round, a question would come up, and the clinical librarian would do a very quick literature 
search, and speak to us afterwards to let us know the current situation and the current evidence.” (Consultant) 
 
 “When the clinical librarian first came on the ward, we thought ‘A librarian? What would we want a librarian 
here for? But do you know what, the culture then changed because the clinical librarian would say, ‘I’ll look that 
up for you.’ All of sudden, everyone thought that having a clinical librarian on the ward was quite a good idea. 
Now we miss the clinical librarian. We miss the role. I don’t know who can signpost the nurses anymore, because 
now they have to go down to the library and find someone, whereas with the model, the clinical librarian would 
be here on the ward several days a week, and much more accessible.” (Nurse) 

 

6.5 Clinical librarian reflections on the model 

6.5.1 Reflective log 
A reflective log was kept by the clinical librarian during the 15-month period that the model was implemented to track 
observations relating to relationships and behaviour, as well as personal reflections. Key observations from the reflective 
log are summarised below.  

6.5.1.1 Building trust with critical care staff and patients 
Working in the critical care unit itself presented challenges and opportunities for the clinical librarian. Working in close 
proximity to the patients’ bedside meant that contact with critical care staff was immediate. This resulted in the building 
of positive relationships and trust between the clinical librarian and critical care staff.  It allowed a greater insight into 
clinical practices, departmental culture and relationships with the patient and family. It enabled the clinical librarian to 
observe opportunities for enhancing the knowledge mobilisation model.  However, it also meant that the clinical 
librarian worked in closer contact with acutely unwell patients, as well as witnessing conditions and procedures that 
could be distressing.  Resilience and adaptability were required to work in this environment. 

6.5.1.2 Building awareness of the clinical librarian role 
The model began with an intense period of awareness-raising throughout the critical care department.  Several 
promotional tools were successful enablers for conversations and contact with staff.  The clinical librarian wore a t-shirt 
which displayed ‘Library & Knowledge Service’.  Promotional pens were distributed to staff and both acted as a 
conversation starter.  Posters were displayed on the back of toilet cubicle doors, contact details were detailed on 
posters and the noticeboard.  
 
A change in the awareness of staff was noted at around month 3 of the model.  On entering the critical care department, 
the clinical librarian began to be greeted by staff saying, “Oh, I need to speak to you!”  Generally people did not make 
contact by email or phone but waited until the clinical librarian was visible in the department.  Awareness was a two-
way process; it was essential for the clinical librarian to have an insight into departmental culture, for example, 
understanding that nurses did not like to discuss work topics while on their break.   
 
Being visible in the department resulted in several opportunities that might not have been realised otherwise.  Involving 
the clinical librarian in some aspects of care, e.g. patient information, was a new concept for a lot of staff, so being “in

the right place at the right time” and being involved in conversations presented an opportunity for the clinical librarian 
to be a part of critical care work.   

6.5.1.3 Support from senior members of staff  
Championing by senior members of staff (matron, consultants) encouraged uptake of library support. The matron 
considered the clinical librarian “one of the team”.  One of the senior nursing staff actively encouraged colleagues to join 
the Facebook group.  Consultants advised junior doctors to contact the clinical librarian for support.  Word of mouth was 
extremely powerful in encouraging engagement with the model, particularly amongst nurses, many of whom 
approached the clinical librarian for support on the recommendation of a friend. 

6.5.1.4 Methods of communication 
Critical care staff demonstrated a clear preference for some methods of communication to others. Those preferred in 
relation to the model were the noticeboard, personal contact and Facebook / Facebook Messenger, which were all more 
popular than email or telephone.  It became important for the clinical librarian to exploit all available methods of 
communication to suit the needs and preferences of staff; one piece of information was often delivered in different 
ways to expand reach, such as via social media, noticeboard and email.  Harnessing existing behaviours (such as the use 
of Facebook) meant that knowledge could be shared in a way that didn’t require people to change their behaviour. 

6.5.1.5 Being a source of evidence-based information 
Accessing library support to enhance the information given to patients and family members was a new concept to most 
critical care staff.  Those who did require support wanted evidence
