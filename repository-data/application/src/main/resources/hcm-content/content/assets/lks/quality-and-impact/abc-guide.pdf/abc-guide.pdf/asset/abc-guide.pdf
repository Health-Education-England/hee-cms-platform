Example 

Communicate 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contacts 

 
Identify stakeholders e.g. own staff, 
counterpart, users, HEE , IT 
Have honest conversations 
A new organisation creates a temporary 
period when everyone’s keen to make 
new contacts and get to know new 
people. This can create an opportunity to 
introduce the library to key stakeholders 
and get their views on what would be 
useful  
 
Have something prepared – what would 
you say to the new Chief Executive if you 
bumped into them.

Documents 
. 
A merger or collaborative piece of work 
may generate a number of documents. 
 
Consider who will be responsible for 
keeping them up to date. And who will 
have access to them. 
 
Where will they be stored? 
 
Does your organisation have templates 
that you can use? 
 
Do you need to refer to any existing 
organisational policies or guidance 
 

Examples of documents that 
might be required include: 
 
Action Plan 
Business Case 
Communications Plan 
Minutes of meetings 
Vision 
 
Web based software e.g. Trello 
 
Records Management Policy,

Expectations

Manage expectations of your

Remember people can find change hard. 
 
 
 
See also communication 

Involve your teams as much as 
possible accepting that they 
are stakeholders in the 
outcome. Everyone has an 
opinion and whilst some views 
will have no validity allowing 
people to express their views 
can be sufficient to make them 
feel engaged with the process.

Flexibility 
 
 
Funding bid 

 
Remember people can find change 
hard. 
 
Focus on completion 
 
What will the service look like – merger, 
closure, collaboration, partnership. 
What staff do you need. 
 
 
Be prepared to compromise but be 
clear on non negotiable areas.  
 
 
This is a chance to be clear about any 
extra funding you need and the 
consequences of not having it. 

Where only one organisation 
subscribes to a resource which you 
wish to retain. And the pricing is 
based on clinical whole time 
equivalents. This may increase the 
cost of the resource and you mad 
need additional funding
