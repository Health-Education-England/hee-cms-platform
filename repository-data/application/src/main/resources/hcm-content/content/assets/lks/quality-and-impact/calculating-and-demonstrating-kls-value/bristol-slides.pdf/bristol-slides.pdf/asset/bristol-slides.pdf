Our learning objectives  

1. To understand why calculating and demonstrating value 
is so important to Library Services in today’s NHS  

2. To explore the range of measures and practical 
approaches available for assessing and expressing 
value, both financial and non-financial, and to consider 
which will work in the NHS context  

3. To identify ways in which the information gathered via 
NHS costing techniques and impact toolkits can be 
used in powerful value statements for key stakeholders 

4. To give each participant the opportunity to reflect on 
their learning and consider actions to take forward with 
their respective organisations

Our ground rules 
 Share your experiences and actively listen to others 

 Everyone’s input is equally valued 

 Be open to new ideas and concepts 

 Don’t dwell on things that did not work in the past – learn from 
them 

 Focus on the future you would like to create 

 Discussions and criticisms must focus on issues, not people 

 Don’t just raise problems – think solutions 

 Adhere to timings and have fun! 

 

 We will use a ‘Parking Lot’ flipchart to capture and record 
those aspects of the conversations that are important not to 
forget, but not directly relevant to our learning objectives

© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

The need to calculate and demonstrate 

value has never been so important 
 Endless budget discussions   

 Investment plans scrutiny  

 Being good at what you do is no longer 
good enough 

Easy to describe what you do 

More difficult to demonstrate the 
value you add 

Organisational perception is reality   

Your services and products are as 
strong as their weakest link 

 Very good services are cut because of 
their inability to demonstrate impact  

In terms that the organisation can buy  

 
 

Need 

powerful value 

statements 

for stakeholders!

The results of the pre-training event 

survey 

The challenges you 

face when 

demonstrating value 

in the NHS and the 

competencies that 

enable you to meet 

the challenges 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

What are the 3 top challenges you face when demonstrating value (i.e. 

applying metrics, measuring and reporting value) in your NHS organisation?

What are the 3 top competencies (i.e. skills, experience and knowledge) that 

enable you to demonstrate value in your NHS organisation? 

Bristol – 5/10/12 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

Exercise 1  

‘Build’ conversations to share LIS 

value stories  

Linking story lines to the ‘challenges’ 

and ‘competencies’ results 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

Exercise 1 – objective and 

instructions 

The objective of this exercise is to share, 
capture and use value stories. Stories are a 
powerful way of sharing experience. Value 
stories can evidence success, problems or 
opportunities relating to demonstrating value in 
NHS.  

In groups of 4/5, share value stories and select 
one to write up on the template provided 

Highlights from the stories selected will then be 
shared with the wider group 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

An example from York to illustrate:  

 
  

Name of story: 
• iPads – a return on investment 

 

Essence of story: 
• 4 iPads acquired for benefit of library and outreach users; can be borrowed for 1 week by hospital 

staff so they can experiment with their use e.g. on a ward  

• Popularity is encouraging non-regular library users to join and learn about other library resources 

• Library staff use the iPads on outreach visits, demonstrating facilities available 

• As iPads are returned borrowers are sent a survey (too early to analyse) – but feedback is 

positive – for the wards and home       

 

Challenges and competencies: 
• New skills for Library staff – through setting up iPads, learning the technology themselves 

• Explaining the technology and its use to users 

• Opportunity to add value to library and to broaden user perceptions of what the library can offer  

• Raised the profile of the Library especially on outreach visits

The fundamental building blocks 

needed to put a value on LIS (2) 

2. Agree the service(s) and level or levels at 
which you will be valuing LIS (e.g.

Department/Function, Process, Service, 
Team) 

3. Establish an owner/stakeholder for the LIS 
who will share responsibility for success

value add of LIS against the baseline using tangible 

and intangible measures 

8. Communicate successes, progress, learning with 

impact using current management channels and 

performance governance frameworks

Worked example for Document Delivery 
Key 

Steps 

 

Building Blocks 

 

Name of LIS Service - Document Delivery 

1 Business purpose/objective/value 
proposition  

To provide access to documents and other materials not held in the local content 

collection/e-Library. Enable users to access and read material that will have an 

impact on their job speedily and efficiently  

2 Level/Group focus of measurement  As all users potentially benefit (service available to all), measure at Service level.  
Sample specific user groups periodically to ascertain satisfaction 

3 Establish an owner for the service Needs a business owner. If not, the senior manager to whom the LIS reports must 
assume this responsibility and support the LIS manager.  This service will feature 

in the LIS strategic plan 

4 Establish baseline Cost efficiency (use volume/total cost of service p.a.);  Use by customer segments.  
Evidence of satisfaction with service/ benefit/value.  The cost to the organisation of 

customers doing this for themselves using alternative sources of supply  

5 Future position required  Ensure that service is provided at lowest cost/highest speed.  Is the appropriate 
level of LIS resources dedicated to supporting/delivering the service?  Regular 

review of all sources and resources for materials needed by customer groups   

6 Use any existing organisational 
approaches/KPIs  

Improved turn-round times. Increased levels of user recognition that the service is 

available.  Trends in use by specific customer segments.  Process /cost 

improvement  KPIs.  Targeted savings.  ROI.   Estimate risks to customers and 

organisation of ceasing this service 

7 Periodicity (when) of assessment Review aligned with budgeting process timing.  Need to understand the factors that 
trigger changes in demand.  Review patterns of usage and demand trends 

8 Reporting (how) of success, impact 
and results  

Report on targeted customer satisfaction survey(s) within LIS  reports.  Reports 

made through the budgeting process (trends and costs) i.e. evidence, plus 

exception reports if situation/demand warrants   

9 External benchmarks  The cost of a British Library loan or other document supplier / consortium.   NHS 
benchmarks – National or regional

ROI – an example of a ‘metric’ 

approach to measurement 
Return on Investment calculation 
ROI = Gain from investment - Cost of investment    

       Cost of investment 

To complete the calculation in LIS you need: 
To understand the Costs (direct and indirect) of 

providing the service and alternatives 

To understand the Gain (direct and indirect benefits) 
realised from use of the service and be able to 
monetise these  (translate them into a cash figure)

• Cost of investment 

= cost of services 

for function   

 

 

 

• Assess time per user 

without LIS support minus 

    time per user with LIS        

support 

• Calculate value of time to 

users saved by LIS in £s 

• Estimate value in £s of 

other value/benefits to 

work– time saved, risk 

avoided etc. 

• Assess time per user/cost 

of alternative service = 

this cost avoidance is a 

gain 

• Monetise gains per 

average user and per 

function/user group 

• Calculate ROI for  

function/user group 

• And calculate ROI for 

alternative services 

so you can 

• Compare LIS ROI 

per enquiry per user 

with alternative 

services

An organisational champion 

  
 Senior manager  

 Information and knowledge aware  

 Acts as champion/responsible owner 

 Sounding board - service and value  

 Prepared to be a partner 

 Prepared to communicate value  

 Strategic link between the 

 information/knowledge service, the 

 organisation and its stakeholders 

The Champion 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

Finding and securing champions 
 A champion is a senior (or relatively senior) person with clout, often a manager.  

They don’t need to be a direct user but will need to understand the actual and 

potential value of your services.  They must be prepared to act as the business 

owner of all or specific services on behalf of your organisation so you may need more 

than one 

 You want the champion(s) to work with you to be a sounding board on                                                          

the service(s) and how to demonstrate their value.  You want them to communicate 

value to colleagues to ensure service value is recognised 

 How to find them? 

 Firstly identify potential champions;  the approaches for stakeholder mapping outlined at the 

event are relevant.  Who ideally would be your champions?  People on Operating 

Boards/Executive teams?  The next layer down?  Which roles/functions/groups use most of 

your services or the most expensive services?  Who leads them?   

 Develop a short list using criteria to help e.g. Who do you know already?  Do you have 

colleagues that know your champion well/can help you make contact?  Who is most 

influential, who is most approachable?  Find out what approaches will work with specific 

people   

 Develop a contact plan – people and approaches and pilot  

 Your contact plan – phone or face to face?  Formal or informal encounter?  Objective for first 

contact?  Value proposition for the champion?  “I’m responsible for service X and want to 

improve its value to the organisation.  I think you can help by......”.  Make it clear that you will 

need 15 minutes max at occasional intervals .............. 

 Do a pilot – rehearse with a colleague and have a go – then learn from your pilot and extend 

 Review your approaches at regular intervals

Café 4 – what makes a powerful value 

statement great? 
Alerting Services 

What differentiates a 

powerful value statement 

from a corridor/meeting 

conversation?  

Formal and prepared – planned (based on shared understanding of Alerting Service) 

Relates to organisational objectives and targets these with specific messages 

Powerful enough to be appropriate in different circumstances – succinct but informative 

Must be outcome related and evidenced based 

Critical to LIS – must be running through everything we do 

Aligned with the language used by management and the values of our organisation 

What makes a powerful 

value statement engaging 

and memorable? 

Appropriate language, short and direct – no Library terminology 

Need to have ‘Library’ in there somewhere 

Speak to them in their language 

Language not too complex or advanced (do we use management jargon?) 

Relevant – engaging – memorable – topical – up to date 

For a powerful value 

statement to be great, 

what things (ingredients) 

need to be included?  

Memorable – meaningful – not too long – grammatical – punchy  

Needs to lock in with organisational objectives – include a figure or % 

Language must ring true – easily understandable – solutions, not problems 

Evolve – future-proofed – must sound sincere – and linked to their objectives 

Make clear what’s in it for them – what questions will they ask you? 

Catchy beginning – importance of narrative

Powerful Value Statements 

 When developing a value statement it is important to remember that: 
 The value and reporting requirements of stakeholders differ (see Stakeholder 

Management slides for further information about segmentation) 

 A good value statement is likely to include some facts (about the product or 
service); the context (through the eyes of the stakeholder); some information 
about ‘what’s in it’ for the stakeholder (i.e. reasons why they should be 
interested); and the value (evidenced elsewhere or anticipated) to be gained by 
the stakeholder through use of the product or service 

 When communicating or reporting a value statement it is important to 
remember that: 
 There are many channels for communicating and reporting value and that is 

important to select the right one (or combination of channels) for the right 
purpose (see Reporting Value to Stakeholder slides for further information) 

 You don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, therefore always be 
prepared to share and communicate a value statement in meetings, 
conversations and in other examples of face to face interaction 

 You will not necessarily know the impact of your powerful value statement 
unless you ask the recipient – and be prepared to learn from the feedback they 
provide 

 Success is about achieving a ‘win win’ situation for LIS and the stakeholder   

 We used one Café conversation to consider what makes a powerful value statement great 

 As noted in the Glossary of Terms and Definitions, a value statement ‘is a powerful 
message that can be used to evidence to a customer how an LIS product or service 
contributes specific and indispensable value to that customer (or 
function/organisation).  A value statement can also be used to convince a 
stakeholder or non-user that a product or service is a cost-effective investment’

Learning Objective 4  

To give each participant the 

opportunity to reflect on their learning 

and consider actions to take forward 

with their respective organisations

Exercise 5  

What have we learnt? 

What action will you take? 

 

Group post it notes and themes 

Action Planning Postcards 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

After Action Review  

We considered two of the questions 

commonly used in after action reviews: 

What was supposed to happen? 

What actually happened? 

Was there a difference?  

What did we learn? 

What action should we take?  



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

Reflections:  

Event has made lots of ideas concrete and 

usable 

We can use the  tangible stuff we’ve created 

It is hard for LIS people to register what they 

do 

Persuading users to provide feedback is 

difficult – increasing connectivity with users will 

help  

We have the information to integrate the tools 

into coherent benefits plans for services. 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

Actions:  
 Delegates: please complete feedback form 

 IDW/SEW: 

  will add stories, muffin recipe, sense check scores, techniques and café 

outputs to slide deck plus information on ROI, Balanced Scorecard, 

benefits and sense check examples, information on finding and securing 

champions, and powerful value statements 

 IDW: Action planning postcards will be posted on 5th November  

 

 Bristol and the South West: 

 Pick up the ‘Calculating and demonstrating value and impact’ topic at 

next LIS  managers’ meeting e.g. measuring intangibles  

 Consider  how the Annual Report contents can reflect LIS value  

 Could collective work on stakeholders e.g. mapping them across the 

region be useful?

Conclusions (1)  
 Being good at what you do, and the service you provide, 

is no longer good enough 

 The need to align with your organisation’s priorities and 
evidence the ways in which LIS add value to it has never 
been so important 

 Work with stakeholders to identify the services and 
benefits they need from LIS  

 There are many ways to calculate and demonstrate value 
and it is important to build on and use the techniques that 
already exist in your organisation   

 Maintain a focus on the critical few, rather than the 
important many, indicators of performance 

 Calculating and demonstrating value underpins 
performance and improvement 

 

 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

Conclusions (2)  
 In a tough organisational and economic climate an 

informed and successful LIS Manager will always be able 
to respond to the following key ‘value’ questions: 
 If you had a increased budget of X%, what would you do with it, 

why, and what value would you generate? 

 If you had to cut your budget by X%, how would you do this, why, 
and what impact would this have? 

 In what ways are you working to achieve/deliver more with less, 
why, and what is the benefit to the organisation? 

 What is the value proposition of your LIS? 

 “The purpose of measurement in LIS is to provide the 
data, information and knowledge required to make 
decisions and take actions”. Ward and Wooler 2011
