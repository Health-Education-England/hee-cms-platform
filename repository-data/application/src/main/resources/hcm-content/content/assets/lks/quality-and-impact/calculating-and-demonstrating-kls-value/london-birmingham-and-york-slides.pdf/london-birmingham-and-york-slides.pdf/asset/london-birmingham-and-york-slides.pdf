York Story 1 – Meeting the CEO 

delivers opportunities 
 

Essence of story: 
• Chief Executive coming to our team meeting as part of his back-to-the-floor mission  

• Going away with some more ideas about how the library could support the business  

• We were contacted shortly after this visit by one director and also the communications manager  

• Have become more involved in their work as a result 

 

Post course progress: 
• Trying to establish whether we did the literature search for a tissue viability leaflet about dressings 

that has saved £250k – or can use it as an example to show how using evidence can have a 

massive benefit  

• Investigating the top Athens users – getting in touch with those we don’t recognise – we want – 

possibly as champions?

York Story 2 – Evidence base for 

PILs  
Essence of story: 
• Staff must request a literature search to provide the underpinning evidence for each Patient 

Information Leaflet (PIL) produced 

• Patients are provided with information leaflets that are fit for purpose and contain information 

based on the latest clinical evidence and from a reliable and trustworthy source 

• The evidence (references) are included in a Certificate which is produced for each PIL– this shows 

how the PIL was produced and lists the underpinning research evidence 

• A protocol for the literature searching process was presented as part of our Accreditation for the 

Information Standard 

• Awareness of the importance of evidence based care is increased across the Trust 

Challenges and Competencies: 
• The library was pro-active in becoming involved in this project  

Post course progress:  
• Created a brief benefits plan for library services to trainee doctors and presented this to the 

Medical Education Committee, asking for their help with improving library services specific to 

trainee doctors.  Useful actions agreed

York Story 3 – Carol’s Story – 

Value of Library coaching  
  

Essence of story: 
• The Trust’s ‘Nursing Strategy’ encourages nursing staff to embark on ‘masters’ degrees 

• Although nursing staff may be good clinically, for some, academic work is an anxious experience; 

pressure on them increases especially when ward workloads prevent attendance at university 

workshops 

• Many of them have to do the ‘Evidence Based Practice Module’ as part of their degree which 

includes having to do a literature search 

• As a consequence, trade is created for Library Service one to one training on using the clinical 

databases 

• The Learning Resources Librarian spent quite a lot of time with one nurse who was struggling and 

encouraged her to submit her work.  The nurse was very grateful and commented that trust staff 

didn’t appreciate the value of the Library Service to the organisation.  She would email the Chief 

Executive to tell him 

Post course progress: 
• Nurse emailed the Chief Executive.  HR reported that the Chief Executive gave the Library Service 

a ‘plug’ in his talk to new trust starters at the Corporate Trust Induction

Instructor in a gym in a high secure hospital 

• 2003: Enters nurse training at tentative 2nd attempt; lots of support from people in already 

established relationships (library and others) enabled better use of resources that lead to high 

marks in assignments and more confidence in classroom teaching; and then a qualified nurse role 

back in the same organization 

• 2010: highest user of e resources in Trust; his story used as a case study for annual report; 

reported that he uses NHSE regularly to provide information to patients e.g. medication side 

effects and topics discussed at the care team meetings

York Story 5 – iPads – a return 

on investment  
  

Essence of story: 
• 4 iPads acquired for benefit of library and outreach users; can be borrowed for 1 week by hospital 

staff so they can experiment with their use e.g. on a ward  

• Popularity is encouraging non-regular library users to join and learn about other library resources 

• Library staff use the iPads on outreach visits, demonstrating facilities available 

• As iPads are returned borrowers are sent a survey (too early to analyse) – but feedback is positive 

– for the wards and home       

 

Challenges and Competencies: 
• New skills for Library staff – through setting up iPads, learning the technology themselves 

• Explaining the technology and its use to users 

• Opportunity to add value to library and to broaden user perceptions of what the library can offer  

• Raised the profile of the Library especially on outreach visits

York Story 6 – Library profile 

raised by “doing the job”   
  

Essence of story: 
• Health Visitor/Practice Educator wins award for ‘The positive contribution of black and minority 

ethnic professionals to the NHS – through role models. The report and a DVD toolkit is being 

circulated within NHS and Health Economics organisations   

• Award winner received ‘invaluable and unconditional support’ from the Library; information 

specialist’s name acknowledged in the report; library service profile further raised in the local and 

national launch at the RCN   

• Support provided: literature search on a topic for which limited research was available; obtaining 

hard to track material; sounding board for discussing the evidence/emerging themes from the 

project; polishing and tabulating data; complex aspects of PowerPoint presentation for the launch  

• Library gained profile through the formal acknowledgement during the launch; interest from 

stakeholders supports the SLA between the library and the Wakefield District PCT; other PCT staff 

have contacted the library service for research assistance. Library recognized for research, IT 

services, presentation of complex data, contribution to staff and service development 

Challenges and Competencies: 
• Library has gained project management experience

London Story 1 – Should we 

pay? 
Essence of story:  
• Urgent request from PCT: is there any evidence that vitamin C perfusion (very high doses) is 

effective for people with HIV/AIDS? Information needed for meeting following week where funding 

request to be considered. Reference interview established that discussion is politically sensitive 

• Turned round search in a couple of hours: no evidence to support the request 

• Results received with rapture: cost-saving for PCT, and helped them handle politically difficult 

meeting 

Challenges and Competencies: 
• Knowledge of literature  

• Expert searching  

• Political radar  

• Information analysis and summary  

• Being there when opportunities arise (it was chance I picked up the search request, colleague 

being on leave, and search requester was also filling in, as colleague tasked with preparing report 

for meeting had gone AWOL)

Birmingham Story 3 – How not to 

make changes 

Essence of story:

• How to initiate change

Exercise 5  

What have we learnt? 

What action will you take? 

 

Group post it notes and themes 

Action Planning Postcards 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

What did we learn – discussion (1)  
 Use the language of the organisation 

 Standardise on our ‘value’ language – use the glossary 

 We need to share what we’re doing and use our 
collective experience 

 You must appeal to your working context  

 Go back and look at your baseline – especially when 
services plateau 

 Embed captured stories into our activities to use as 
tangible indicators for the organisation  

 Remember to think of the relative value of services –
which should we fund? 

 If we identify something new to do, consider the impact it 
will have before taking the decision – to do or not to do   

 

 



© Beaworthy Consulting & IDW Ltd 2012 

 Stakeholders – involve a lot more – don’t assume we 
know what they want 

 Create willingness in champions and users to provide 
information on value i.e. swap information for the service 

 Different messages for different stakeholders  

 Need ideas on how to engage and manage champions – 
what are the ways?  What are the channels?   

 How to use baselines with different stakeholders – 
without creating lots of baselines?    

 Contributing evidence to policy documents – what’s the 
value of the LIS contribution e.g. NHSLA?  How can we 
show it?   

 

 

 

What did we learn – discussion (2)
