Libraries concerned: Bath, Salisbury & Swindon (W14, W11 & W01) 
Name of case study: STP wide Implementation of CLIO ILL System 
Date of merger/collaboration: October 2017 onwards 
Date of case study submission: April 2018 
 
Context:  Collaboration 

 
Which libraries 
and/or Trusts 
are involved? 
 

Academy Library, Royal United Hospitals Bath Foundation 
Trust  
Healthcare Library, Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust   
Academy Library, Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation 
Trust.   
 

Summary or 
objectives of 
the merger or 
collaboration 
 
 

A collaborative purchase of the CLIO ILL system.  Two of the 
libraries previously used Winchill which was not ideal as it was 
specific to individual PCs, not accessible to other libraries in the 
area and had become unreliable for one library.   
 
As CLIO is web based the theory is that if one of the libraries 
required support in providing their ILL service due to staff 
shortages then any library assistant from the other libraries 
could step in & use the system. (This hasn’t yet been tested) 

 
What went 
well 
 

Having a “lead” library for the implementation has provided a 
central point of contact & expertise for the other libraries.   
 
An additional benefit is of only one library needing to contact the 
supplier & thus building a relationship with them. 
 
The lead library has also been able to provide answers to 
questions / problems that have already been raised with the 
supplier rather than the supplier being contacted multiple times. 
 
Collaborative working with partner libraries has been a positive 
experience. 

What didn’t go 
so well 
 
 
 

Our one training day with the supplier could have been much 
more clearly focused & productive – didn’t achieve everything 
that we needed to. 
 
Different libraries were able to test / practice on the system at 
different speeds which meant we were at different points when 
agreed date for go live came round 

What were the 
learning 

Plan extensively in advance with supplier objectives / required 
outcomes for any training days.

points from 
this? 
 
 
 

 
Extended testing / practice phase – we went for 1 month of 
testing but at the end of this we were all at different points so go 
live was delayed.  Would have a longer testing phase should we 
collaborate on a project again.

Which libraries 
and/or Trusts 
are involved? 
 

Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust 
University Hospital of North Staffordshire 
 

Summary or 
objectives of 
the merger or 
collaboration 
 
 

Provide a uniformed service across both sites with minimal 
disruption to customers. This includes re-classifying of books at 
LERC, policies and procedures, new LMS which is part of Keele 
University. 

 
What went 
well 
 

• Strong working relationships between managers – a clear 
advantage is the managers at the two sites already knew each 
other through attending the same patch meetings and various 
other regional meetings and conferences. So both knew about 
each other’s services. 

•  During the merger the two library managers had regular 
meetings to discuss their budgets, resources, policies and 
procedures and staff. Both managers were able to support each 
other along with staff on both sites to enable a reasonably 
smooth transition without too much disruption to their services. 

• Open communication with staff once we knew when the merger 
was going to take place 

• Clear objectives and management direction 

• Able to pool resources and avoid duplication. LERC have 
access to more electronic resources. 

• Able to get experienced library staff from the Health Library to 
cover staff shortage. This was a big plus as it meant not having 
to spend time training up a temp. 



 Library Merger/Collaboration Case Study 
 

 

• Although there were two library managers nothing was actually 
put in writing who would manage who. Our priority at the time 
was to get the services running smoothly with minimal disruption 
both to customers and staff. Neither manager knew what to 
expect so supporting one another at the time was essential. 

What didn’t go 
so well 
 
 
 

• Short time scale so a lot to do once we knew the exact date of 
merger. Nearly 4 years down the line and still working on 
various policies and procedures. 

• Even though we thought we had lots of things covered it wasn’t 
until after the merger that we found problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

• Impact on staff morale – because of uncertainly during the 
transition and just after, we had staff vacancies. Recruiting to 
these posts was delayed due to new HR systems in place and 
also restructuring of posts in various admin departments. 
Getting use to different policies and systems (more 
organisational than library).  

• Weren’t allowed to discuss the merger until we had a date and 
even then this was changed. 

• Short term impact on service delivery due to staff shortage. 

• IT infrastructure – on two different systems and during merger 
having to deal with two IT departments. 

• Need to re-classify all book stock to align with Health Library 

• Merger of two services means licencing costs go up 

• Website presence on Trust Intranet and also Health Library 
Website 

• Our catalogue and webpage is geared up for NHS users so for 
certain e-resources like Clinical Key books can be searched for 
on our catalogue – this can’t be done on the Health library 
catalogue as shared with Keele. 

• At LERC during the merger users with a Mid Staffs Athens 
account could also have a Stoke Athens account this caused 
confusion amongst new Trust members at County who were 
only entitled to a Stoke Athens. 

• Various problems between library users wanting to use both

libraries and not being able to access the library out of hours. 

• Library members having to join at both libraries – so two 
separate cards plus an extra card if Stoke members want out of 
hours access. 

 
What were the 
learning 
points from 
this? 
 
 
 

No matter what you prepare for beforehand, there will always be 
something that trips you up. But as long as you are open and honest 
with staff it can be worked through. 
 
If there are two library managers already in post you will have to accept 
that one will be managing the other. We at HL and LERC have been 
very lucky as the manager at LERC still has her own budget and is still 
responsible for her staff.  
 
As we all have to report to someone it doesn’t have to be a battle to 
report to another library manager. If anything it actually works well as 
the LM knows and appreciates your problems and has more of an 
understanding of what you are going through. So don’t fight with each 
other, work together and you will have a happy outcome when the 
merger happens.
