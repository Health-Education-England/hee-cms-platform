NHS-funded Knowledge and Library Services 

Implementing the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework from 2023/4  

 

 

1. Introduction: a service improvement focus 

The NHS knowledge and library services team provides professional leadership, advice and support at every 
level of the system, to enable the NHS to extend, optimise and sustain knowledge services. As part of this 
role, on behalf of the NHS in England, the team leads on the quality assurance of NHS-funded knowledge and 
library services. The approach is focused on facilitating service improvement.   
 

The Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework for NHS-funded knowledge and library services is fully 
integrated into the quality processes for the NHS Education Contract, as part of the wider Quality 
Framework. The annual quality self-assessment survey, issued by regional Quality teams to organisations 
with an NHS Education Contract, requires the submission of a Service Improvement Plan for knowledge and 
library services. 
 
The approach from 2023/4 has been developed from a review of options, in the light of feedback from 

knowledge and library services, the national quality team and the NHS knowledge and library service team.  

Plans for implementing the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework from 2027/28 onwards, 

including self-evaluation and the review of service improvement plans, will be informed by a refresh of the 

Framework in the light of feedback, current evidence on maturity models and the principles set out in 

Appendix 1. 

 

2. Implementation from April 2023  

1) Biennial Service Improvement Review: Each NHS organisation in receipt of NHS Education Contract 
funding is to submit a knowledge and library Service Improvement Plan, with supporting documentation, 
for review and discussion every two years. 

 
2) Submission of self-evaluation for validation: The timelines and extent of submission of self-evaluation 

for validation will be reviewed following an update to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes 
Framework in the autumn of 2022, with the earliest potential date for self-evaluation submission being 
2027/28. 

 

3. A biennial review of Service Improvement Plans 

From April 2023, a review of each Placement Provider’s Service Improvement Plan for its knowledge and 

library service/s will be held every two years. The team will connect with the provider organisation to 

schedule the review meeting with the organisation and the manager(s) of the Knowledge and Library 

Service(s) which provide services to their staff and learners, giving 12 weeks’ notice of the meeting.  

The review will be based on submission and discussion of the following documents, which each organisation 

will be asked to submit: 

1) The Service Improvement Plan in place for the organisation’s knowledge and library service(s). 

2) The most recent Knowledge and Library Service Annual Report. 

3) Service Level Agreements: Copy of all SLAs for knowledge and library service provision, where these 

are in place. Each must be signed by both parties.

Organisations will be required to use the Service Improvement Plan template provided. This will mirror the 

refreshed Outcomes Framework, enabling the organisation to demonstrate activity and progress against the 

six outcomes. The template will incorporate opportunities to show how the organisation is thinking 

strategically about the provision of knowledge and library services for their staff and learners. 

 
The organisation will be required to submit the documents no later than 3 weeks before the meeting date. 
The discussion will focus on: 
 

• recent service improvements 

• the plan for future development 

• any risks and concerns with which the team may be able to help, including escalating issues to 

resolve with the support of HEE Quality and regional teams 

• identifying good practice to celebrate and share with other knowledge services 

 

4. Self-assessment: Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework submissions 

The Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework will be refreshed in the autumn of 2022, following the 

baseline self-evaluation for 2020/21. This will then be reviewed, taking feedback from a range of 

organisations and knowledge and library services, ensuring that the mechanism meets the principles set out 

in Appendix 1. Detailed communications will follow. 

 

5. Supporting local organisations 

An ad hoc Service Improvement Review can be requested by the organisation at any point in the cycle where 

this might be helpful, perhaps at a time of significant change or to support a new service manager.  

In the best interests of learners and staff, and aligned to the NHS Education Contract Quality process, the 

national team may request further evidence and a meeting at any point.  In collaboration with regional 

Quality teams, a formal visit will be triggered where concerns are identified, or interventions need to be put 

in place.
