knowledge and evidence to support 

decision making?

– Management

– Clinical

– Patient

• Is effective knowledge management 

enabling staff to learn from 

experience to accelerate the adoption 

of innovation?



• Is the organisation making 

best use of LKS expertise to 

mobilise knowledge and 

evidence?

How will it help with decision-making for the
