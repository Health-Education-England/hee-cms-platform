Things to think about for Service Improvement
• Are staffing levels sufficient and appropriate for delivery of service priorities?

• How does staff recruitment, induction and training support customer service 

objectives?

• How are staff encouraged to gain appropriate qualifications?

• What opportunities are there for staff development and progression, do staff 

undertake regular career reviews?

• How are staff updated on new information services and resources?

• How is staff knowledge of the changing content of the library’s information 

resources kept up-to-date?

• How well do staff demonstrate and share the breadth of their knowledge?

• How are staff trained in using all library collections, both print and electronic?

• Appraisal and personal development planning, use of the PKSB

• To develop a comprehensive set of development opportunities to meet the 

needs of those working in embedded and outreach roles
