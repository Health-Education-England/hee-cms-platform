• The evidence based provides justification for any service 

changes

• It supports continuous development 

within the service.

• It supports the continuing

professional 

development

• It demonstrates that service is contributing to the research 

evidence base

for this outcome

• No access to a library 

and knowledge 

service

• Not yet delivering 

against this Outcome

• At the start of journey



• Team members keep up to 

date

the team

• Appropriate evidence used 

when a change to practice 

is required

Level 1 focuses on keeping up to date with good 

practice discussing with the team and applying the 

learning to service changes





• Systematic approach

• On-going evaluation 

and review

• How are library and knowledge 

staff encouraged to introduce new 

services or improve existing ones?

• How good are the library and 

knowledge staff at adapting the 

service to change?

• How do staff contribute to the 

library and knowledge research 

evidence base?



• What is new and innovative in terms of 

how the service is planned or managed, 

or promoted?

• How are new developments identified, 

planned and managed?

• What changes have been implemented 

recently?

• What has not worked and why?

• Is there a reliance on one type of 

evidence above the others when making 

decisions?

• Are the decisions made about the library 

and knowledge service based on the 

best available research evidence?

Things to think about for Service  Improvement



Good practice identified in 

the Pilots

• Literature to support 

developments

• Contributing to the 

evidence base

• Quality improvement tools –

PDSA

• Adoption of good practice



Feedback to the 

Pilot Sites • Proactive not reactive
• How the external evidence is 

used in practice 

• Using a variety of evidence 

including published

• How it relates to the service 

plan
