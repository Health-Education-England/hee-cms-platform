Strategic Context and Development of the 

Quality and Improvement Outcomes 

Framework



Strategic Context for the Framework

Healthcare is a knowledge industry. It is not enough to have the right teams in 

the right place, collaborating to deliver high quality, efficient patient care. It is 

essential that they use the right knowledge and evidence at the right time. 

(NHS Library and Knowledge Services in England Policy1 p. 2)

• Knowledge for Healthcare: a Development Framework

• NHS Library and Knowledge Services in England Policy

• HEE Topol Review

• NHS Long Term Plan



HEE Quality Framework

• The Outcomes Framework will be integral to the HEE Quality 

Strategy6 which defines quality as:

Education and training within a well-led effectively managed and 

supportive learning environment that provides opportunities for the 

current and future healthcare workforce to develop the knowledge, 

skills, values and behaviours to deliver the highest quality patient care. 

p.7

• They are also critical to the HEE Quality Framework 7 providing a 

new outcomes-based structure to support quality and improvement 

and evidence for quality standard 1.5:

The learning environment provides suitable educational facilities for 

both learners and educators, including space, IT facilities and access to 

quality assured library and knowledge service. p.9



Development of the Outcomes Framework

• HEE’s Knowledge for Healthcare provided a commitment to:

…refresh the Library Quality Assurance Framework to ensure it 

continues to drive service improvement and is aligned with wider 

education and service monitoring processes. p.48

• Quality Improvement approach to development

• Informed by current thinking and robust research on impact 

evaluation

• Development builds on the learning from both the LQAF process 

and the 2018 pilot of the draft NHS Library and Knowledge Services 

Quality Improvement Standards.

Development – who was involved



What we learned from the Pilot
What we did:

• Evidence 
Collection

• Feedback

• Assessment

• Retrospect

Overall the pilots welcomed the new standards and the 
focus on service improvement

Changes Made:

• Ensured no duplication and repetition across the 
outcomes

• Levels of development defined

• Scope for each outcome included

• Evidence expressed as outcome rather than process



Launching the Outcomes Framework

• Working with HEE Communications Team

• Designed and published on HEE website

• Social Media, HEE Life

• Launch date in June

• Briefing to Chief Executives from Patrick Mitchell



Question

Has everyone seen a copy of the preliminary 

outcomes?



Section 2

Introduction and Overview of the Quality 

and Improvement Outcomes Framework



The Outcomes Framework

This new framework signals a step change to 

help library and knowledge staff both to 

improve service delivery for patients and to 

better articulate the positive outcomes of their 

work. Therefore, I am delighted to commend 

this new Quality and Improvement Outcomes 

Framework to you. It sets the standards and 

ambition for quality and improvement in the 

delivery of these vital services.” 

Patrick Mitchell, Director of Innovation and 

Transformation HEE



Purpose of the Outcomes Framework

The focus of the Outcomes Framework is on an outcomes-based

approach to library and knowledge service improvement. 

The Outcomes Framework has a dual role and has been designed 

and developed to:

• drive progress in library and knowledge service improvement 

leading to increased satisfaction for users of the services

• provide a tool for NHS organisations to ensure a quality, high 

performing service that is continually developing and improving 

to meet the changing evidence and knowledge needs of 

organisations and individuals. 



The six Outcomes

1. All NHS organisations enable their workforce to freely access proactive library 

and knowledge services that meet organisational priorities within the framework 

of Knowledge for Healthcare.

2. All NHS decision making is underpinned by high quality evidence and knowledge 

mobilised by skilled library and knowledge specialists.

3. Library and knowledge specialists identify the knowledge and evidence needs of 

the workforce in order to deliver effective and proactive services. 

4. All NHS organisations receive library and knowledge services provided by teams 

with the right skill mix to deliver on organisational and Knowledge for Healthcare

priorities. 

5. Library and knowledge specialists improve the quality of library and knowledge 

services using evidence from research, innovation and good practice.  

6. Library and knowledge specialists demonstrate that their services make a 

positive impact on healthcare. 



The Structure of the Outcomes Framework















Question

Having seen the outcomes, do they make sense 

to you?



Section 3

Using the Quality and Improvement 

Outcomes Framework:

Overview of Self-evaluation and service 

improvement planning



Self-Evaluation and Baseline Process



Self-Evaluation

 

 

 

 

All NHS Organisations, with an LDA, collect evidence  

and self-evaluate April 2019 – March 2020 

 

 

All NHS Organisations submit baseline self-

evaluation and evidence report by 26th June 2020: 

• Evaluation of current status against levels, 

with supporting evidence 

• Include key evidence – strategy, 

implementation plan, annual report and SLAs 

where applicable 

• Action plan identifying areas for quality 

improvement against the outcomes 

• Pen portrait 



Self-evaluation is a 

continuous process of 

improvement in which 

library and knowledge 

specialists critically 

examine the services 

they provide against the 

quality outcomes to 

evaluate how well they 

are delivering the 

services and identify 

improvements that can 

be made.

What is self-evaluation?

Self-evaluation enables NHS organisations 

to:

• recognise strengths in their library and 

knowledge service provision

• identify areas for improvement and 

draw up plans for action

• share good practice

• report to stakeholders on the quality of 

service provision

• demonstrate the relevance, value and 

impact of their library and knowledge 

service to their user base.



Question

Thinking about how you are going to prepare for 

the self-evaluation, who might you want to 

involve?



How well are we doing?

Evaluating current practice

How do we know?

Gathering evidence

Self-evaluation – what’s involved?



Self-evaluation will highlight areas for 

improvement

What are we going to do now? 

Planning and Implementing 

improvements

Planning Service Improvement
Think about how Quality 

Improvement tools and 

techniques can be used to 

underpin service improvement



What if I serve multiple Trusts?

• If your library provides services under an SLA to 

another LDA organisation, you will be asked to 

contribute to that organisation’s self-evaluation.

• If you are one of several libraries partnering to deliver 

to one LDA organisation, collaborate to pool evidence 

and produce one self-evaluation return for the 

organisation.

• If you have any questions about how this might apply 

to you, use the chat function or email us and we’ll 

follow up with you after the webinar.

Baseline Validation and Reporting



Baseline Validation Validation July - Oct 2020 
Single national process for validation
Cross region approach
Each submission reviewed and validated by:
•1 HEE LKS team member from the region of 
submission
•1 HEE LKS team member from another region
•LKS Managers to shadow validation process
Consistency checking throughout process

Calibration Nov 2020
•To ensure fairness, accuracy and consistency
•To review comparison of final levels applied
•To provide feedback to validators
•After Action Review
Calibration team:
•Chair:  Senior Advisor KfH
•Regional Leads
•Quality and Improvement project group
