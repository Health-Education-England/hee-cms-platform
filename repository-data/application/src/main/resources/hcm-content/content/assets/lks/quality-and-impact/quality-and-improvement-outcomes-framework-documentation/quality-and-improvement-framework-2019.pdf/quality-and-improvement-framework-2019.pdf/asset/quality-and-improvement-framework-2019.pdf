Framework for NHS Funded Library and 
Knowledge Services in England, 2019



Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework

1

Foreword

Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. 
Healthcare library and knowledge services make a 
business-critical contribution to the NHS. Indeed, 
they are a powerhouse for education, lifelong 
learning, research and evidence-based practice.

Health Education England (HEE) exists for one 
reason only: “to support the delivery of excellent 
healthcare and health improvement to the 
patients and public of England...”. HEE’s vision 
for NHS funded library and knowledge services in 
England is that “All NHS organisations, their staff, 
learners, patients and the public use the right 
knowledge and evidence at the right time in the 
right place to enable high quality decision making 
to achieve excellent health care and health 
improvement.”

Patrick Mitchell, Director of Innovation and 
Transformation said:

“It is not enough to have the right healthcare 
teams in the right place, collaborating to 
deliver high quality, efficient patient care. It is 
equally essential to make sure that everyone 
uses the right knowledge and evidence at 
the right time across the NHS. I am hugely 
impressed by the professionalism of librarians 
and knowledge managers in health care and 
their dedication to providing evidence to 
inform decision-making on the ward, in the 
community and by the Board. 

This new framework signals a step change 
to help library and knowledge staff both 
to improve service delivery for patients and 
to better articulate the positive outcomes 
of their work. It makes a fundamental shift 
in emphasis focusing on outcomes rather 
than process. Its development was informed 
by current thinking and robust research 
on impact evaluation methodologies and 
methods in the field, including those used by 
the Global Libraries programme of the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation.

Therefore, I am delighted to commend this 
new Quality and Improvement Outcomes 
Framework to you. It sets the standards and 
ambition for quality and improvement in the 
delivery of these vital services.”

Professor Wendy Reid, Executive Director of 
Education and Quality and Medical Director 
writes:

“Putting timely knowledge into the hands of 
healthcare professionals working across care 
settings is vitally important for making clinical 
decisions that are based on sound evidence. 
With unprecedented time pressures on health 
professionals, embedded health librarians and 
knowledge services to support them in clinical 
and community settings are a vital resource.”

As HEE progresses the implementation of our 
Knowledge for Healthcare strategy, we build on 
an exemplary record of cooperation between 
information professionals, and between healthcare 
library networks in England. Focused on outcomes 
and service improvement this framework moves 
the assessment of these services to the next 
stage, ensuring that their quality is defined by 
outcomes not process. The Framework enshrines 
a commitment to continuous improvement at the 
heart of service delivery, embedding this approach 
into the day to day work of NHS librarians and 
knowledge managers.

Strategic Context 

Healthcare is a knowledge industry. It is not 
enough to have the right teams in the right 
place, collaborating to deliver high quality, 
efficient patient care. It is essential that they 
use the right knowledge and evidence at 
the right time. (NHS Library and Knowledge 
Services in England Policy1 p.2)

Healthcare library and knowledge specialists (i.e. 
all members of the library and knowledge team) 
act as knowledge brokers. They use their expertise 
to mobilise evidence obtained from research, staff 
“know-how” and external innovation and good 
practice to aid the workforce in making effective 
and informed decisions. 

Health Education England (HEE) published 
Knowledge for Healthcare: a Development 
framework for NHS Library and Knowledge 
Services2 in England in December 2014. This set 
out a clear vision:

NHS bodies, their staff, learners, patients 
and the public use the right knowledge and 
evidence, at the right time, in the right place 
enabling high-quality decision making, learning, 
research and innovation, to achieve excellent 
healthcare and health improvement. p.9 

The NHS Library and Knowledge Services in 
England Policy outlines HEE’s commitment to 
ensuring the use in the health services of evidence 
obtained from research. It is also committed to 
enabling the NHS workforce to freely access 
library and knowledge services to achieve 
excellent healthcare and has the ambition that the 
role of library and knowledge specialists becomes 
business critical to the NHS.

The importance of knowledge, evidence and 
digital technologies to the NHS is reinforced 
by the NHS Long Term Plan3 and the HEE Topol 
Review.4

Developing the Quality and Improvement 
Outcomes Framework

From 2010 to 2018 the Library Quality Assurance 
Framework (LQAF) raised standards across 
healthcare library and knowledge services. 
HEE’s Knowledge for Healthcare provided a 
commitment to: 

…refresh the Library Quality Assurance 
Framework to ensure it continues to drive 
service improvement and is aligned with wider 
education and service monitoring processes. 
p.48

Part 1: Introduction



3

The subsequent review has moved quality 
assessment away from process, standards and 
compliancy that drove the LQAF. This change 
in emphasis will ensure a concentration on 
improvement, development and delivery of 
service outcomes. The development of the Quality 
and Improvement Outcomes (the Outcomes 
Framework) was informed by the HEE Knowledge 
for Healthcare Evaluation Framework5 and builds 
on the learning from both the LQAF process 
and the 2018 pilot of the draft NHS Library 
and Knowledge Services Quality Improvement 
Standards. 

The Outcomes Framework will be integral to the 
HEE Quality Strategy6 which defines quality as:

Education and training within a well-led 
effectively managed and supportive learning 
environment that provides opportunities for 
the current and future healthcare workforce 
to develop the knowledge, skills, values and 
behaviours to deliver the highest quality 
patient care. p.7

They are also critical to the HEE Quality 
Framework7 providing a new outcomes-based 
structure to support quality and improvement and 
evidence for quality standard 1.5:

The learning environment provides suitable 
educational facilities for both learners and 
educators, including space, IT facilities 
and access to quality assured library and 
knowledge. p.9

Purpose of the Quality and Improvement 
Outcomes Framework

HEE is responsible for ensuring that there are high 
quality learning environments for all healthcare 
learners in England. Key to this are library and 
knowledge services, supporting both individual 
and organisational learning and development 
needs. HEE also seeks assurance that the funding 
provided to organisations through the Learning 
Development Agreement is used to deliver library 
and knowledge services that are fulfilling the 
requirements of Knowledge for Healthcare, in line 
with the NHS Library and Knowledge Services in 
England Policy.

The library and knowledge service’s NHS host 
organisation, and those who commission such 
services, are required to ensure that the service 
is helping them meet their obligations under the 
Health and Social Care Act 20128 to ensure “...
the use in the health service of evidence obtained 
from research…” (section 1E) so that the NHS 
workforce is enabled to deliver high quality 
patient care.

Part 1: Introduction

The focus of the six Outcomes is on library and knowledge service 
improvement. The Outcomes Framework has a dual role and has been 
designed and developed to:

• drive progress in library and knowledge service improvement leading to 
increased satisfaction for users of the services

• provide a tool for NHS organisations to ensure that library and knowledge 
specialists are providing a quality, high performing service that is continually 
developing and improving to meet the changing evidence and knowledge 
needs of organisations and individuals.

Criteria for the redesign of library and knowledge services (Knowledge for Healthcare p. 18)

Economy of scale Function can generate economies of scale, offering value for money if delivered at a large scale. 

Local knowledge Function requires in depth knowledge of needs of the local health economy and/ or strong organisational relationships.

Nationwide functions Function will benefit from a geographical focus or nationwide leadership to achieve national delivery, and/or building 
on the foundation of established regional service/s.

Opportunity for standardisation Function can be delivered using a standardised approach across a wide geography/ number of customers. 

Specialist skills Function requires specialist skills that are scarce and may not be widely available at a local level, or equitably across t 
he country. 

Guiding principles and values

Knowledge for Healthcare’s principles and values and design criteria underpin the six Outcomes and can be used to inform how library and knowledge services 
can implement service improvement.

Part 2: The Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework (the “Outcomes Framework”)

The outcomes

1. All NHS organisations enable their workforce 
to freely access proactive library and 
knowledge services that meet organisational 
priorities within the framework of Knowledge 
for Healthcare. 

2. All NHS decision making is underpinned 
by high quality evidence and knowledge 
mobilised by skilled library and knowledge 
specialists.

3. Library and knowledge specialists identify 
the knowledge and evidence needs of the 
workforce in order to deliver effective and 
proactive services. 

4. All NHS organisations receive library and 
knowledge services provided by teams with 
the right skill mix to deliver on organisational 
and Knowledge for Healthcare priorities. 

5. Library and knowledge specialists improve the 
quality of library and knowledge services using 
evidence from research, innovation and good 
practice. 

6. Library and knowledge specialists demonstrate 
that their services make a positive impact on 
healthcare. 

Reporting on the quality and improvement 
outcomes framework

All NHS organisations with which HEE holds 
a Learning and Development Agreement will 
be asked to carry out a self-evaluation against 
the outcomes. Self-evaluation enables NHS 
organisations to:

• recognise strengths in their library and 
knowledge service provision

• identify areas for improvement and draw up 
plans for action

• share good practice

• report to stakeholders on the quality of service 
provision

• demonstrate the relevance, value and impact 
of their library and knowledge service to their 
user base.

Strengths in provision need to be celebrated, 
maintained and continuously reviewed. Areas 
for improvement require analysis and discussion 
before plans for action can be developed and 
implemented. The improvement plan should feed 
the continuous cycle of review and action.

Validated self-evaluation

The HEE Library and Knowledge Services Leads 
will validate the self-evaluation reports as part 
of the HEE Quality Framework assessment. The 
validation process will:

• build and support the capacity of library and 
knowledge specialists to evaluate their services 
and improve the quality of services they 
provide; 

• support HEE’s quality systems; 

• support, promote and develop good practice in 
NHS library and knowledge services; 

• provide information to HEE and the NHS on the 
quality of provision in library and knowledge 
services; and 

• offer a national and consistent validation of 
self-evaluation processes. 

The pages that follow provide more details of the 
six outcomes along with the levels.

Outcome 1: All NHS organisations enable their workforce to freely access proactive library and knowledge services that meet organisational 
priorities within the framework of Knowledge for Healthcare

Scope Key Questions to ask Why is this outcome important?

This covers the strategic development of the library and 
knowledge service where its staff proactively deliver the 
priorities of both the organisation and Knowledge for 
Healthcare. 

It includes how library and knowledge specialists:

• create strategic plans with deliverable and evaluated 
outcomes

• engage and consult with senior stakeholders to 
identify, review and evaluate library and knowledge 
service developments 

• routinely use performance monitoring and evaluation 
processes

It will show the extent to which the organisation:

• recognises the business-critical role of library and 
knowledge specialists and 

• commits to providing appropriate resourcing and 
enables the workforce to freely access the service.

• How are library and knowledge specialists 
empowered and supported to improve services and 
realise the vision?

• Are library and knowledge specialists being 
recognised at Board level as having a business-critical 
role in achieving the priorities of the organisation?

• What new services or innovative projects/
developments have recently been introduced?

• How are library and knowledge specialists 
demonstrating the strategic impact and contribution 
they are making to delivery of organisational and 
Knowledge for Healthcare priorities.

• Is there an ongoing and systematic process in place in 
for engaging senior stakeholders in the development 
and evaluation of the service?

People should be cared for by competent and capable 
staff, receptive to innovation and able to use evidence 
from research. All NHS bodies and their staff should be 
able to access the expertise and resources offered by 
healthcare librarians and knowledge specialists (HEE 
NHS Policy for libraries).

The Secretary of State for Health has a duty, under 
the Health and Social Care Act 2012, to ensure “...
the use in the health service of evidence obtained from 
research…”.

In delivering these requirements it is essential that NHS 
organisations are served by library and knowledge 
specialists who are proactively delivering a service to 
meet the vision and priorities of the organisation and 
Knowledge for Healthcare.

Outcome-based Evidence Examples for Outcome 1

• Library and knowledge service strategy and annual plans showing resourcing (with 
budgets and costings), monitoring, review and achievements.

• Service level agreements, memoranda of understanding and contract monitoring 
with stakeholder organisations.

• Identified annual priorities and outcomes.

• Annual activities, evaluation and outcomes.

• Stakeholder endorsements – feedback/stories from senior stakeholders working 
with the library and knowledge specialists to support strategic delivery and 
direction.

Outcome 2: All NHS decision making is underpinned by high quality evidence and knowledge mobilised by skilled library and knowledge specialists.

Scope Key Questions to ask Why is this outcome important?

This outcome covers the role of library and knowledge 
specialists in facilitating the mobilisation of evidence and 
internally generated knowledge to underpin decision 
making, innovation and change.

It shows how the Board and organisations use the 
expertise of library and knowledge specialists, to 
work with teams, senior stakeholders and the Board, 
to implement evaluated and effective approaches to 
knowledge mobilisation.

It also measures the extent to which the organisation 
recognises the business-critical role library and 
knowledge specialists have in facilitating the 
mobilisation of evidence and internally generated 
knowledge.

• How embedded in the organisation(s) are the library 
and knowledge specialists?

• Does the Board consider the expertise of library and 
knowledge specialists in mobilising evidence and 
organisational knowledge to be business-critical?

• Can it be shown that a range of decisions 
(management, clinical, patient) are made based on 
library and knowledge specialist input?

Healthcare is a knowledge-based industry. It is essential 
that the workforce use the right knowledge and 
evidence at the right time to support decision making 
and best practice (HEE policy).

The Topol Review recommends “NHS Boards should 
take responsibility for effective knowledge management 
to enable staff to learn from experience (both successes 
and failures) and accelerate the adoption of proven 
innovations. (OD5) Topol Review p.16.

Healthcare library and knowledge specialists use their 
expertise to mobilise evidence obtained from research, 
organisational knowledge, staff ‘know-how’ and from 
external innovation and good practice to underpin 
decision making in line with the legal duty of the service.

Sharing the ‘know-how’ of staff, using research 
evidence and implementing good practice are all 
business-critical.

Outcome-based Evidence Examples for Outcome 2

• Evidence and knowledge mobilisation plans, achievements/outcomes and 
evaluation of these in supporting decision making.

• User endorsements regarding achievements and benefits – senior stakeholder/
team/Board narratives and endorsements – feedback/social cards/stories from the 
teams with whom the library and knowledge specialists have worked to support 
knowledge mobilisation.

• Quality improvement methods being used to underpin this outcome.

• Link to evidence for Outcome 6.

• Details and evaluation of innovation that the library and knowledge specialists have 
implemented in relation to evidence and knowledge mobilisation.

• Levels of activity and analysis carried out by the library and knowledge specialists to

Outcome 3: Library and knowledge specialists identify the knowledge and evidence needs of the workforce in order to deliver effective and 
proactive services

Scope Key Questions to ask Why is this outcome important?

This outcome highlights how library and knowledge 
specialists deliver proactive stakeholder and user 
focused library and knowledge services.

The outcome covers how library and knowledge 
specialists:

• analyse the “market” for their services for existing 
and potential users

• engage and consult with stakeholders

• promote and market targeted service offers to 
existing and potential users

• work collaboratively to extend the reach and spread 
of their services

• enable users to access high quality evidence at the 
point of need and in an appropriate format.

• How well do the library and knowledge specialists 
identify and meet the requirements of the healthcare 
workforce’s broad range of evidence and knowledge 
needs?

• How well do the library and knowledge services 
provided meet the differing needs of all users?

• In what ways do the library and knowledge specialists 
support individuals and organisations to locate 
and use evidence and organisational knowledge 
effectively?

• In what ways does the library environment promote 
and support learning?

• How are literacy initiatives supported within the 
organisation?

Library and knowledge specialist need to be proactive in 
responding to changes in workforce needs and related 
strategies.

Patient outcomes and organisational decision making 
depends on the quality of evidence supplied. The 
stakeholder workforce needs access to the right 
knowledge and evidence to deliver high-quality, safe 
healthcare.

A successful library and knowledge service should have 
a high percentage of use by its stakeholder workforce. 
The stakeholder workforce experience and satisfaction 
depend on the quality of knowledge, expertise, 
customer service and professionalism of all library and 
knowledge specialists.

The stakeholder workforce wishes to access evidence 
in appropriate formats and services at different times 
and in different locations. The stakeholder workforce 
needs consistent and equitable access to library and 
knowledge services.

Outcome-based Evidence Examples for Outcome 3

• Evidence of service improvements showing the development of a proactive, 
effective library and knowledge service.

• Evidence that changes in practice are driven by user experience and user journey 
mapping to show how a proactive, effective library and knowledge is developing.

• Evidence that initiatives taken contribute to this outcome.

• Quality Improvement methods being used to underpin this outcome e.g. user 
experience and user journey mapping

• Library and knowledge services marketing and publicity plans.

• Evidence of reviewing the outcomes of marketing and publicity plans.

Outcome 4: All NHS organisations receive library and knowledge services provided by teams with the right skill mix to deliver on organisational 
and Knowledge for Healthcare priorities

Scope Key Questions to ask Why is this outcome important?

This covers the requirements for:

• suitably qualified library and knowledge specialists

• with the relevant skill mix and 

• optimum numbers

to deliver an evolving service, working in partnership 
with colleagues from other library and knowledge 
services where appropriate.

It considers the library and knowledge specialist:

• qualifications 

• skill mix 

• opportunities for regular continual professional 
development.

The library and knowledge service manager has a 
duty to ensure that the recruitment, induction and 
employment review and development processes are in 
place and effective.

The manager should forward plan and review capacity 
and skill mix to meet changing needs and any demands 
for the subsequent redesign of existing roles. 

For the library and knowledge service:

• Are staffing levels enough and appropriate for 
delivery of service priorities? 

• Do staff have the right skill mix?

• Have roles been reviewed and redesigned?

• How do staff recruitment, induction and training 
support wider organisational objectives? 

• How planned and systematic is embedded e.g. 
clinical and outreach librarian work?

• How are staff updated on new knowledge and 
evidence services and resources?

Do you have enough library and knowledge specialist 
capacity to deliver on change and innovation?

The NHS workforce faces increasingly complex 
challenges in accessing timely, accurate and tailored 
evidence, and to effectively manage organisational 
knowledge. 

All NHS organisations should be served by library and 
knowledge specialists with the skill mix to deliver 
against organisational and Knowledge for Healthcare 
priorities. 

To build this capacity Topol recommends increasing “…
the numbers of ... knowledge specialist posts, with 
dedicated, accredited time to keep their skills up to 
date... (AIR5/DM4). Topol Review p.57

There are opportunities to embed more library and 
knowledge specialists in clinical and practical settings 
to create more clinical and outreach librarian posts. 
They can then act as knowledge brokers and take an 
overview of knowledge and evidence needs and identify 
gaps in provision or skills development. 

Outcome-based Evidence Examples for Outcome 4

• Outcomes of library and knowledge staffing and skills audits.

• Examples of role review and redesign.

• Impact of embedded/clinical/outreach librarian roles.

• Outcomes of a recent development/ training needs assessment. 

• Appraisal and personal development planning - (examples showcased in the CILIP 
Health Professional Knowledge and Skills Base).

• Significance of qualifications held by staff in post.

• Continual professional development programmes for staff. 

• Impact of continual professional development on service delivery.

• Examples where sharing and reflection on continual professional development and 
the learning is put into practice.

• Outcomes of partnership working to increase capacity to deliver the service.

Outcome 5: Library and knowledge specialists improve the quality of library and knowledge services using evidence from research, innovation 
and good practice

Scope Key Questions to ask Why is this outcome important?

This outcome shows how library and knowledge 
specialists implement evidence based practice in the 
planning, design and delivery of the activities, products 
and facilities (“the library and knowledge service”) they 
provide. 

Improvement to existing services and the development 
of new services may involve:

• adopting or adapting innovation/good practice

• reviewing effectiveness of services

• showing optimised investment

• testing for cost-effectiveness.

• How do library and knowledge staff keep up-to-date 
on the latest developments in the profession to help 
identify and evaluate ideas for service improvement?

• Is this an ad-hoc, opportunistic process or embedded 
within the culture of the service?

• Where opportunities for library and knowledge 
improvement/development/ innovation are identified 
how are these progressed, monitored, and evaluated?

• How are service improvements and developments 
shared with the wider library and knowledge 
profession?

• How cost-effective are the services provided?

Library and knowledge specialists support evidence-
based practice across healthcare organisations. It 
is therefore something which they should practice 
ensuring the continuing improvement of the services 
they provide.

Expansion of the service into new areas can only 
be achieved through efficiencies by rationalising 
investment, reducing duplication, streamlining back-
office functions and exploring partnership opportunities.

Library and knowledge services need to evolve in a 
planned and structured way based on the best available 
evidence and professional knowledge. Changes should 
be evaluated and shared with others to prevent the 
duplication of errors and ensure the spread of good 
practice.

Outcome-based Evidence Examples for Outcome 5

• How innovation/ good practice/ new technologies have been adapted or adopted 
within the library and knowledge service. 

• Analysis and reflection on what local statistics show.

• Impact outcomes/stories of service improvement and development.

• Masters/PhD dissertations on library and knowledge issues/ topics submitted by 
members of the library and knowledge services team.

• Testing and review of services and other deliverables.

• Work flow analysis including analysing process costs (time spent, staff and resource 
costs) for providing individual services.

• Value for money/return on investment/ benefits realisation/cost benefit studies.

• Appropriate research published in library and knowledge peer reviewed and non-
peer reviewed journals.

• Library and knowledge service evaluations.

• Shared learning reports with reflection on the implications for the library and 
knowledge service.

• Reflective pieces on identified good practice, innovation and research.

• Good practice or innovation submissions to the national database.

• Quality improvement methods being used to underpin this outcome.

• Examples of the application of LEAN thinking

• Streamlining back-office functions

• Cost-benefit and return-on-investment analyses.

Outcome 6: Library and knowledge specialists demonstrate that their services make a positive impact on healthcare

Scope Key Questions to ask Why is this outcome important?

This outcome covers the effectiveness of library and 
knowledge specialists in collecting evidence to show 
the impact of their services and how it is used to 
promote the service both internally and externally to 
stakeholders.

Impact is defined as:

“… The difference or change in an individual or group 
resulting from the contact with library services (3.25)”.

British Standards Institute/International Standards 
Organisation 16439: 2014

Delivery of the outcome will demonstrate the 
importance and business-critical nature of library and 
knowledge services to the organisation and health 
economy in areas including but not limited to:

• personal or professional development

• service development or delivery

• collaborative working

• quality of patient care

• informed decision making

• reduced risk or improved safety

• financial effectiveness. 

• How do we know if the work of the library and 
knowledge specialists makes a difference to the 
organisation’s staff and the work they do within and 
outside the organisation?

• How are library and knowledge specialists ensuring 
that impact data are collected in an efficient and 
effective manner, and that appropriate opportunities 
to share this data with decision makers are taken?

• How are impact data shared with the wider library 
and knowledge services community and the HEE 
Library and Knowledge Services Leads to ensure that 
it is available for use in advocacy, good practice, and 
for reference by other services?

The ability to demonstrate the impact of library and 
knowledge specialists is important for the future and 
continuation of a library and knowledge service.

Organisational decision makers need to see evidence of 
the difference made by library and knowledge specialists 
in order to make appropriate funding and investment 
decisions.

Furthermore, an awareness of the differences library 
and knowledge specialists can make to organisations 
drives usage of the services they provide and creates the 
potential for further impact.

At national level, using impact data for advocacy 
provides a valuable tool to promote the message of the 
need for library and knowledge services to ensure high 
quality healthcare, evidence-based-practice, and to fulfil 
the requirement to ensure “the use in the health service 
of evidence obtained from research” (Health and Social 
Care Act 2012).

Outcome-based Evidence Examples for Outcome 6

• Impact Questionnaire Data evidencing the collection of quantitative data.

• Impact Case Study / Narrative data evidencing the collection of qualitative data.

• Evidence of using impact data in local promotion. 

• Evidence of impact collection being embedded in the service.

• Evidence of sharing the impact data beyond the organisation.
