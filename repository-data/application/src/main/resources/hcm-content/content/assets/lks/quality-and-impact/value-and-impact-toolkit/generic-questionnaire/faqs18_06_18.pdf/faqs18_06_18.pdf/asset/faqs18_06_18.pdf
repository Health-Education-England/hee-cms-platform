Frequently Asked Questions 
  

 FAQ Response 

1 On the questionnaire, question 1 has a check-box answer for use of the 
library service that allows more than one answer to be selected. Yet 
question 2 starts “from that single use…” Won’t this cause confusion? 
 

The questions have been tested on 214 library users and this 
did not appear to cause confusion. However we will keep this 
in mind, and review in the future  

2 Aren’t we just cherry-picking good stories for marketing purposes? 
 

This was a real concern for the TaF, which is why we spent so 
long looking at the existing research. The evidence has 
identified these impacts, so the quantitative questionnaire will 
identify how often these known impacts occur. This gives a 
context for the qualitative case studies, and for the activity 
data that is collected nationally. If an interview or case study 
finds a negative impact we wouldn’t select it for advocacy or 
marketing that is true – but we could use it for service 
development or “lessons learned” 

3 Why is there no option for comments, or “other”.  Isn’t it all a bit 
leading? 
 

We spent lots of time debating this. A key request from library 
staff was for a short, practical questionnaire. Some libraries 
don’t collect impact evidence because they don’t have time to 
handle the responses. The questionnaire therefore doesn’t 
collect any free text.  This is why we spent so long looking at 
the existing research. The evidence has identified these 
impacts (and no others that can’t be mapped to them), so the 
quantitative questionnaire will identify how often known 
impacts occur. This gives a context for the qualitative case 
studies, and for the activity data that is collected nationally. 

4 How long should libraries wait for impacts to happen, and when 
should services send out the questionnaire? 
 

Very much a local decision as it depends on the circumstances 
and the particular impact of interest. A recent study (Brettle et 
al 2016) sent out the first questionnaire immediately following 
the contact then a reminder 6 weeks later. We will explore

more of the evidence about the impact of learning and 
development events, as there may be a need for additional 
tools or guidance for best practice (based on evidence and 
consensus) 

5 Can libraries use their own questions or tools as well? 
 

We have been quite rigorous in looking at the existing 
evidence and existing tools, and have striven to ensure that the 
data collected maps to the current evident base regarding 
health library impact. In the past slightly different wording or 
outcome categories has made comparison between studies 
difficult.  This has been compounded by small samples 
suggesting that the evidence base is weak. Using the questions 
as they stand will make comparison, and collation of data 
possible and allow us to develop the evidence base at a 
national level. Libraries can add more specific questions (or 
develop their own), but ideally these should be selected from 
existing tools (such as the others listed in the toolkit) to enable 
comparison to other studies and to help us build the evidence 
base at local and national levels. 

6 How will the data from the core questions be collated?  
 

Based on experience piloting the questionnaire we are 
currently looking at regional or patch collection of the 
quantitative data using a shared survey software account. The 
process will be tried in two areas (Kent, Surrey and Sussex and 
Yorkshire and Humber)  Some individual libraries are also 
trying out the questionnaire locally. The TaF has some ideas 
about collecting and collating the data annually perhaps at the 
same time as annual statistics are collected. 

7 How will the case studies be collated?  
 

Case studies can be submitted by LKS at any point during the year 
using the submission form on the KfH Blog

8 What happens after they are submitted? You should receive a confirmation message from the blog 
stating that your case study has been submitted. After this the 
case studies are assessed by a panel made up of LKS staff from 
across the country who look at each case study against the 
checklist provided on the blog.  
 
If we are unable to accept the case study for any reason you 
will receive a message detailing the reasons for this. 
 
Successful case studies are uploaded to the public facing area 
of the blog and LKS leads notified of examples added from 
their regions.  
 
As case studies are generally assessed a monthly basis you 
should allow up to 10 weeks following submission before you 
hear anything. 

9 Will the interview record sheets be collated?  
 

No. They are for best practice really. The results could then be 
fed into case studies, which is what we need at national level 
for K4H. Ideally the in-depth interviews would be used in a 
robust research study so the results could be published. This 
research needs to continue to identify new impacts, or changes 
in what library clients’ value. 
 

10 What will happen to the existing training impact survey?  
 

Library services using the training impact toolkit have been 
notified that is was switched off at the end of March 2017

My library clients work in local government and their role isn’t 
included in the list for question 5 

You could add locally relevant options locally. We did consider 
using “other” but this is best avoided as free text complicates 
the data crunching. The TaF will need to think through how to 
capture these other roles when data is merged

12 Focus Groups – are there any plans to develop tools to capture impact 

from Focus Groups? 

 

The Impact Interviews templates could be adapted to work for 

Focus Groups. If you decide to go down this route, please share 

with us any modified tools you create and your experiences 

too. 

13 Will any further tools be made available to assist in capturing financial 
impact? 
 

There is a forthcoming KfH TAF on Return on Investment, 
probably in 2018, which will look into this. The contact for this 
is Linda Ferguson. 
 

14 Is any guidance available to help capture consent. Yes.  The Value and Impact TAF have produced a guidance 
document to assist with this. 
 

15 How do I obtain consent to record impact interviews with colleagues? 
 

The interview consent form has been updated (August 2017) to 
allow for the capture of consent specifically for recording of 
interviews. 
 

16 I am not including quotes from named individuals in my case study.  
Why do I have to give tick the button to say I have consent? 
 

The forms is set up on the assumption that personally 
attributable data is included so if this is not the case with your 
case study then obviously you don't need to get consent from 
these third parties. 
 
Just check that if you are quoting anyone and not actually 
giving their name, their identity cannot be traced back in other 
ways (eg through job titles: "Head of Nursing")  
 
If all the information contained in the case study is from 
you/library staff then you could read this is you /library staff 
giving consent for us to use it.

Can I still collect Impact Data now that the General Data Protection 
Regulations (GDPR) are in place? 
 
 
 
 

We sought advice on this and confirm that GDPR should not 
stop services collecting Impact information relating to their 
service. 
 
There are two bases on which the impact data collection 
process could be supported: 
 

1) Collection of impact data is an inherent part of the 
library service itself.  If you receive the services of the 
library then you are asked about its impact.  Both LQAF 
and the Quality Improvement Standards make it clear 
that gathering Impact data is an essential element of an 
NHS Library and Knowledge service.  Hence provision of 
the service and collection of impact data pertaining to it 
are two parts of a single continuum of service. 
 

2) If you feel that impact data collection is a distinct 
activity in its own right, and cannot be justified as 
above, then legitimate interest would be a reasonable 
basis for processing the data. 

 

However: 
 

• if recipients actively object to any impact information 
requests then they should not be approached in the 
future 

• to avoid confusion any requests for impact data should 
not be sent alongside promotional or marketing 
information
