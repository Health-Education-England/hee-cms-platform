1. User research overview
1.1. Executive summary

This research was conducted by Lagom Strategy (an agency
specialising in discovery and user research for digital services)
between April and June 2022.

The research focussed on the needs of healthcare staff in
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of
Ireland who use e-books from their knowledge and library
service.

The research activities were conducted in line with the UK
Government Service Standard definitions and guidance for user
research as part of discovery work.

The work has concluded with a prioritised user needs backlog
and a set of findings for the library and knowledge services
team to consider.

The main findings are:

Context and purpose

◆ Users share a common definition of e-books

◆ There appears to be limited interest in interactive content

◆ Users utilise e-books for a range of purposes

◆ Over three quarters of e-books users access e-books for
more than one use

◆ A number of users rely on e-books to do their job

◆ People seem to be accessing more electronic formats in
general (including e-books)

E-books user research Page 3 of 47



◆ Use of e-books seems to have become more important
during the pandemic

Access

◆ The main way that e-books are accessed seems to be on
work desktop computers and laptops

◆ Users don’t appear to distinguish between different
platforms

◆ A small number of users feel that e-books are not visible
enough

◆ Access to a physical healthcare library isn’t strongly linked
to whether or not individuals utilise e-books

◆ Users have different perceptions about the range of
e-texts available compared to physical libraries

◆ Users’ IT confidence seems to affect their take up of
e-books

◆ Several users expressed a desire for training about how
to use e-books

◆ Some users imagine that costs might prevent libraries
from making e-books available

◆ Some users access e-books via other means

◆ There is some awareness of e-book licensing practices

User experience

◆ Individuals who use healthcare e-books seem to have a
high level of satisfaction

◆ A helpful librarian was cited as an invaluable resource by
a number of users

◆ Most users feel that e-books are a good way to access the
most up-to-date information

E-books user research Page 4 of 47



◆ The majority of users are satisfied with the range of
e-books that they get access to

◆ One of the main frustrations for users is not having
access to the full text

Behaviour

◆ There are big differences in how frequently people use
healthcare library service e-books

◆ Not all users choose e-books over paper books

◆ Users value the ability to use e-books from any location

◆ Users appreciate the in-text features that are an
advantage of e-books over other formats

◆ Many users find the ability to copy and paste from
e-books a useful feature

◆ Being able to search within texts is cited as an important
time-saving feature

Nation and roles

◆ There may be different levels of awareness in different
nations and different regions

◆ Users want to know that they’re accessing the same range
of texts as their peers in other areas

◆ Medicines information pharmacists are most likely to
have integrated e-books into their role

1.2. User research goals
At the start of the research we agreed on these goals with the
Health Education England team:

1. Who: understand who users of e-books in the NHS
actually are.

E-books user research Page 5 of 47



2. What: understand what they are using e-books for.

3. When and how: Understand and articulate the common
scenarios and user journeys for users of e-books

a. Identify the user needs in those scenarios.

i. Validate the significance and impact of those
needs, and prioritise them.

b. Understand the current range of platforms, tools
and systems that they use.

i. What influences users’ choice of format? (e.g.
when would they choose e-book over print?).

c. Understand how well they meet these needs.

i. What do they think about the current
experience?

ii. Do they have unmet needs?

iii. What are the common barriers?

iv. How does the experience differ across
different e-books platforms?

d. Why do they do it this way? E.g. training, access to
devices, platforms, tools, or licences.

i. What devices do they commonly use (eg
personal vs work devices, desktop vs
handheld)?

ii. What influences frequency of use of
e-books?

e. How inclusive do users feel e-books are, and why?

1.3. The scope of the user research
The scope of the work was limited to healthcare staff (in
training, clinical, and non clinical) using e-books through library
and knowledge services.

The research also engaged users who did not use e-books.

The research covered users from across the five nations
(England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of
Ireland).

This work provides findings from the research, rather than
making any recommendations about how to proceed.

1.5. User research activities
The user research was conducted during April and May 2022.

The activities allowed us to generate the insights in this report
and the other user research outputs:

1. Kick-off workshop with key project stakeholders.

2. Reviewed online and documentary sources (see Annex I).

3. Conducted 14 one-to-one user interviews/observiews.

4. Ran a user needs workshop with an end user, to
generate user journey maps and proto-personas.

5. Analysis of a user needs validation survey with 212
e-books user responses and 109 non user responses.

6. Developed journey maps for 24 user journeys.

7. Developed 5 user proto-personas.

8. Created and prioritised 29 user needs with the library
and knowledge services team.

9. Presented a project show-and-tell.

1.5.1. User research participation levels

Participation levels in the user research activities were
satisfactory for the level needed for a thorough user research
process. We engaged with individuals from a good range of user
roles.

In terms of the qualitative research, we interviewed 4 people
from Northern Ireland, 3 from England, 3 from Scotland, 2 from
Ireland and 2 from Wales. Our user who participated in the
workshop also worked in Wales (see Annex 1 for a breakdown of
the different job roles held by participants).

In terms of users of e-books who completed the user needs
validation survey, we had 119 respondents from Northern

E-books user research Page 8 of 47



Ireland, 37 from Wales, 27 from England, 21 from Scotland and
8 from Ireland (see section 4 for a more detailed discussion of
the user need validation survey).

1.6. Key associated documents
◆ A list of prioritised user needs

◆ A set of proto-personas

◆ Digitalised user journey maps

Note: all project documentation has been gathered and shared
with the HEE library and knowledge services team team

1.7. Background to this user research
Health Education England, and the equivalent organisations in
Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland,
wanted to better understand how people currently use e-books
in healthcare.

They commissioned this research to help understand the
behaviours, needs and expectations of e-books users across the
five nations.

This work builds on previous work into the use of e-books in
healthcare. But there has not been any previous user research
into the use of e-books conducted on this scale.

This user research will inform future approaches to e-books
across the five nations, including to inform procurement, and
future platform choices.

2. User research
2.1. Method

Our researchers consulted with a range of users during the user
research to explore their context, needs, emotions, and
behaviours.

2.1.1. Qualitative research
◆ 14 one-to-one interviews with user representatives

◆ 1 user participant working alongside the client team in a
user needs workshop, including journey mapping

◆ Open text comments in 321 online survey responses

Note: Unfortunately we were unable to conduct observations
during the interviews as we had planned. A number of the early
participants experienced difficulties sharing their screen, to the
detriment of the flow of the interview and our ability to address
the research questions. So the remaining sessions focussed on
interviews, rather than observations.

2.1.2. Quantitative research

◆ 321 respondents to the online user needs survey

Note: Surveys were online, with links cascaded digitally. It is
appreciated that this may bring a bias toward users with a
higher level of digital literacy. This was considered when
interpreting the results.

2.2. User roles
The user research explored these user roles, identified during
the inception phase:

E-books user research Page 10 of 47



2.2.1. Primary roles

◆ NHS staff in training

◆ Those who are in formalised training, such
as apprenticeships or university courses.
This may mean that they also have access to
e-books via a university library.

◆ Current NHS staff

◆ Incorporates both clinical and non-clinical
roles, as well as those in community based
practices and those in acute hospitals.

◆ NHS staff doing CPD

◆ Individuals who have a role in the NHS (or
HSE / HSC) and are undertaking professional
development. This could be specific, such as
a nurse taking their revalidation, or more
general learning.

Through the process of undertaking the research these
roles were refined further in order to give more clarity
and a deeper level of detail.

These refined user roles were as follows:

◆ CPD and training users

◆ Users who draw upon e-books to aid their
professional development and/or support
their learning as part of an accredited
programme of study.

◆ Research users

◆ Users who utilise e-books to complete
research which is directly related to their
role.

◆ Medical enquiry users

E-books user research Page 11 of 47



◆ Characterised by medicine information
pharmacists who utilise e-books regularly to
complete patient care queries.

◆ Teaching users

◆ The research identified a small group of
users who draw upon e-books to help them
develop programmes of work.

◆ Non-users

◆ Individuals who either choose to not use
healthcare library e-books or do not know
that they can access these.

E-books user research Page 12 of 47



3. Findings
Findings are presented by 5 overarching themes:

◆ Context and purpose

◆ Access

◆ User experience

◆ Behaviour

◆ Nations and roles

3.1. Context and purpose

3.1.1 Users share a common definition of
e-books

In speaking to both users and non-users of e-books across the 5
nations it emerged that individuals tended to share a common
definition of e-books.

They typically defined e-books as electronic versions of existing
printed books.

“An e-book is a resource that we have traditionally as a
paper book and then they make an electronic version of
that paper book.” - E-books user, Scotland

“The ones that I know are definitely e-books are online
versions of the ones we’ve had on the shelf.” - E-books
user, England

E-books user research Page 13 of 47



3.1.2 There appears to be limited interest in
interactive content

Our working definition of e-books included reference to some of
the imagined benefits of e-books over other formats, including
the facility to provide interactive content.

Working definition of an e-book (from the research
kick-off workshop):

An electronic version of a book that can be read on a screen

Contains text and images, and can be interactive

Consumed on any digital device (PC, tablet, mobile,
dedicated e-reader)

Accessed by healthcare staff, sometimes in preference over
printed books

Sometimes purchased as bundles, enabling access for
groups of staff

However, most users who were interviewed as part of the
research expected e-books to simply be an electronic copy of
familiar paper texts.

“I can’t be doing with too many animations and things in
books.” - E-books user, England

“The Renal Drug Handbook is great ‘cos that’s exactly the
same as it is online.” - E-books user, England

3.1.3 Users utilise e-books for a range of
purposes

Our research revealed that many users utilise e-books for a
number of different purposes.

The core reasons identified were:

E-books user research Page 14 of 47



◆ to support training and CPD

◆ for research

◆ to answer medical enquiries

◆ to support service/quality improvement

◆ to aid teaching

Participants in our research often referred to the very specific
purpose they used e-books for.

“If I get enquiries about the effects of medicine I would go
onto the Meyler’s Side Effects of Drugs to have a look at
that resource.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

“I was doing an enquiry about a medicine and somebody
who’s breastfeeding. So I used an electronic book to find
out information from that.” - E-books user, Scotland

“Looking for a reading list for the student nurses [...] we
were looking for different journal articles plus electronic
books as well. So they could access it to support them to
complete the module.” - E-books user, Scotland

“Overall I use them for work and that brings in training
and CPD alongside it.” - E-books user, England

“I’d just mainly use them when I need some theoretical
back-up, or I’m doing some of my own research.” -
E-books user, England

3.1.4 Over three quarters of e-books users
access e-books for more than one use

Our research suggests that most people who use e-books, use
them for more than one purpose.

E-books user research Page 15 of 47



Image: Bar chart presenting the uses of e-books

Our user needs validation survey shows that only 24% of users
access e-books for just one use, whilst 76% access them for
more than one purpose.

3.1.5 A number of users rely on e-books to do
their job

Our research suggests that some users use e-books out of
preference. They would rather use e-books than other formats.

But for some, accessing electronic texts is borne out of
necessity. For these users, they might rely on e-books because
they are the only up-to-date versions of texts available to them.

“Well I wouldn’t be able to do my job [if I no longer had
access to e-books, essentially.” - E-books user, England

“At work we’re not really allowed to use the [paper] books
- or discouraged - in case they’re not up-to-date.” -
E-books user, England

E-books user research Page 16 of 47



3.1.6 People seem to be accessing more
electronic formats in general (including e-books)

Our research suggests a more general trend away from print
formats towards electronic versions of texts.

Many users who we spoke to during the research utilised
electronic copies of journal articles and other electronic
formats, as well as e-books.

“Bit of both [online journals and e-books], it just depends
on the type of enquiry we’re doing.” - E-books user,
Scotland

“It’s probably more the journals that I would use. ‘Cos
within mental health nursing it’s obviously the most
up-to-date research that we would be looking for.” -
E-books user, Scotland

3.1.7 Use of e-books seems to have become
more important during the pandemic

Perhaps unsurprisingly, our research suggests that use of
e-books seems to have played an increasingly important role
during the pandemic.

Users may have spent more periods of time working from
home, and found it more difficult to access physical libraries
during this period.

“The way covid had impacted on our services the last
couple of years … we had to change our approach. So we
were relying on the HPSC and the HSE and then our own
online research.” - E-books user, Ireland

E-books user research Page 17 of 47



3.2. Access

3.2.1 The main way that e-books are accessed
seems to be on work desktop computers and
laptops

We heard from users about their personal use of e-books for
pleasure, which tended to be undertaken on tablets and readers
such as iPads.

But this contrasted with the devices they used to access e-books
for work, which were much more likely to be desktop computers
or laptops.

“Work laptop all the time, I don’t use a tablet or a phone
for work at all.” - E-books user, England

“The laptop really. I’ve been working a lot from home so
either the computer at the office or most likely the laptop
when I’m at home - a work laptop.” - E-books user,
Scotland

“[Use personal e-books] through Amazon and tablets. I
would have personal e-books, nothing work-related on
that.” - E-books user, Ireland

3.2.2 Users don’t appear to distinguish between
different platforms

It was notable from the research that users do not tend to
distinguish between different e-books platforms.

The users we spoke to tended to use the same e-books
repeatedly. Typically, they accessed these e-books in a routine
manner in which the platform they used to find and access
them was not recalled as being of major significance.

E-books user research Page 18 of 47



Most of the users we spoke to had utilised their library
catalogues and / or lists of URLs put together by librarians.
There was little evidence of web searches being used to access
e-books.

“I would search for [e-books] either through the
healthcare library or through the university library.” -
E-books user, Northern Ireland

If they did have a preference for a platform, this tended to be
determined by recommendations, or familiarity with a
publisher.

“A lot of the stuff work-related would be recommended
from the Infection Prevention Control Society or through
HSE or the HPSC.” - E-books user, Ireland

3.2.3 A small number of users feel that e-books
are not visible enough

Some individuals involved in our research interviews
complained that access to healthcare library service e-books is
not visible enough to them.

They suggested that this lack of visibility might result in staff not
utilising e-books as much as they might have done.

“There’s probably loads more e-books that I don’t know
and don’t use because I don’t know that they’re there.” -
E-books user, England

“We don’t seem to publicise it that it’s available and it’s
there - it’s only when I went looking for it that I found that
there was actually training.” - E-books user, Ireland

Some participants said they were not aware that they could
access healthcare library service e-books before they engaged in
our research.

E-books user research Page 19 of 47



3.2.4 Access to a physical healthcare library isn’t
strongly linked to whether or not individuals
utilise e-books

We found no strong link between access to a physical library,
and take-up of e-books.

Responses to our user needs validation survey show that:

◆ 83.02% of e-books users have access to a physical
healthcare library

◆ 76.15% of non-users of e-books have access to a physical
healthcare library

So our research suggests that people without direct access to
physical books are also slightly less likely to use e-books.

We might have expected there to be a stronger link between
take-up of e-books, and access to a physical library, but our
research found no strong correlation.

3.2.5 Users have different perceptions about
the range of e-texts available compared to
physical libraries

Some users believed that using e-books meant they had access
to a greater range of publications.

But while this perception about availability was common, it was
not shared by all users.

Some felt that there was a greater range of hard copy
publications available to them, either immediately or on request
from a library.

“It seems hard copies are available much more than the
e-versions.” - E-books user, Wales

E-books user research Page 20 of 47



“They rarely have it but they will access it for you and they
will do their utmost to get it for you.” - E-books user,
Ireland

3.2.6 Users’ IT confidence seems to affect their
take up of e-books

Some of the participants we spoke to cited their lack of digital
skills or confidence as a barrier to using e-books.

Those users told us that they might be more likely to utilise
healthcare library service e-books if they were shown how.

We heard about this lack of digital confidence in our research
with non-users, and some of those who did use e-books.

“I’m IT literate ‘cos I use it all the time but I’m not an
expert and it puts me off - anyone less than me I think it’d
put you off altogether.” - E-books user, England

“If you’re like me - which is slightly older - then you’re not
used to using computers … I am quite tech-savvy but it
took a long time … if you’re not tech-savvy then that’s
going to be an extra barrier.” - E-books user, England

“Every time I’ve looked at it in the past I’ve just found it a
bit too complicated.” - Non-user, Wales

3.2.7 Several users expressed a desire for
training about how to use e-books

We heard users talk about the need for training, in a few
different ways.

Some talked about a need for personal or classroom training
about how to use e-books. While others mentioned other
methods that might enable more self-service learning.

“Education and training would be really good.” - E-books
user, Northern Ireland

E-books user research Page 21 of 47



“A fact sheet or just a quick video which shows ‘look this is
what you can do with e-books’. So it’d probably be
something like that that’d be useful.” - E-books user,
Northern Ireland

However, this apparent need for training may reflect different
problems, for which training is not the only solution.

Some users just wanted e-books to be easier to access and use,
rather than being trained how to use something they might find
difficult.

“Keep it simple to use as not everyone is computer
literate.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland, user needs
validation survey

3.2.8 Some users imagine that costs might
prevent libraries from making e-books available

Some users expect e-books to be less available to them,
because they would be too expensive for library services to
purchase.

“Our library has refused to purchase some titles as
e-books due to the cost in comparison to the paper
version.” - E-books user, England, user needs validation
survey

“Medication and Mother’s Milk is a breastfeeding resource
and there is an online version of that … but it’s really
expensive, so it’s probably more cost-effective to have
just the printed version of that.” - E-books user,
Northern Ireland

“It tends to be I haven’t got access to this e-book because
it’s too expensive for the number of times we would do
that query.” - E-books user, England

We don’t know from our research whether or not costs are a
barrier to library services making e-books available. Rather we
note the perception amongst users that e-books might be less

E-books user research Page 22 of 47



available because of cost, and the impact this might have on
their expectations and behaviours.

3.2.9 Some users access e-books via other
means

Users of e-books in our research usually knew that they could
access e-books via their healthcare library services.

But when we asked where else users looked for similar
information, it emerged that some users also accessed
healthcare e-books via other means.

We found that a number of the users we spoke to also had
access to university e-library platforms.

A smaller number of users also told us that they paid for private
subscriptions to certain professional platforms.

“I use OpenAthens a lot as a NHS worker. I also am
affiliated with a university so I use their search tool as
well.” - E-books user, England

“I can access some of the journals through my own
professional subscription.” - E-books user, Wales

3.2.10 There is some awareness of e-book
licensing practices

Issues around the licensing of e-books were a clear theme in the
e-books SOS project which we analysed as part of our document
review.

Licensing issues did not often come up in our qualitative
research with users, although we did encounter some
awareness of how e-booked might be licensed, and how this
might impact availability for users.

E-books user research Page 23 of 47



“You require licensing for some of them, a lot of the
licensing would be purchased through the HSE.” -
E-books user, Ireland

E-books user research Page 24 of 47



3.3. User experience

3.3.1 Individuals who use healthcare e-books
seem to have a high level of satisfaction

We have not conducted a quantitative measure of satisfaction
as part of our research, but our qualitative evidence suggests a
high level of satisfaction amongst users of e-books.

‘Accessible’ and ‘useful’ were key terms used to describe
e-books.

“It’s a useful resource and I always like to support it if I
can because I wouldn’t like it to go!” - E-books user,
Scotland

“It’s great that there are e-books out there but it’d be
useful to know what would be available to us, and to
perhaps have some training as well. But overall it’s really
useful to have them.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

3.3.2 A helpful librarian was cited as an
invaluable resource by a number of users

Several users talked positively about receiving support from
librarians in relation to accessing e-books.

“We have a dedicated pharmacy librarian and they cover
the healthcare library as well for us. So if I had any
problem at all I would contact her no problem.” - E-books
user, Northern Ireland

“The support I got from the librarian was great, she was
very prompt and very helpful.” - E-books user, Northern
Ireland

“Our librarian is a really enthusiastic librarian, so if
somebody did need teaching how to use something her

E-books user research Page 25 of 47



and her little tiny team would do that.” - E-books user,
England

Our user needs validation survey confirmed a high level of user
need for the support received from librarians.

UN09: To have access to a dedicated librarian so that I can
get help when needed when finding and using e-books

3.3.3 Most users feel that e-books are a good
way to access the most up-to-date information

A number of the users we spoke to had been encouraged to use
e-books in order to access the most up to date information.

“I would quite often rather get the paper book, but of
course the e-books are updated more often so then you
can’t trust the book.” - E-books user, England

“I’m going to be looking at changing different policies … so
that’s something probably I will be accessing the library to
see as well. To make sure our policies are up-to-date to
current guidance, so an e-book would be good!” - E-books
user, Scotland

Our survey revealed a very high level of user need for accessing
the most up to date information.

UN01: To access the latest edition of an e-book so that I have
the most up-to-date information

However a handful of users voiced concerns that the e-books
that have access to through healthcare library services may not
actually be the most up-to-date versions.

“Some of those books that we would use I’d like to see
updated versions of them, because I use them but I know
they’re really valuable.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

E-books user research Page 26 of 47



3.3.4 The majority of users are satisfied with the
range of e-books that they get access to

The majority of users we engaged with appeared to be satisfied
with the range of e-books which they get access to.

“The range is good, you’ve got all these Oxford texts, so
we don’t have to go to the library, the library comes to us
really!” - E-books user, Scotland

“I’m very satisfied, but I suppose I don’t really know what’s
out there or what I’m actually missing ‘cos I’m not actively
searching for e-books, so I suppose that’s a problem -
actually knowing what is actually available.” - E-books
user, Northern Ireland

But a few users did mention the range of texts available as a
barrier to their usage of e-books.

For example some participants mentioned that the most
up-to-date versions of key texts are not available to them
electronically.

“We feel hard done to in our mental health service that
we can’t access certain texts electronically.” - E-books
user, England

3.3.5 One of the main frustrations for users is
not having access to the full text

We heard from a number of users that they were sometimes
able to start to read an e-book, only to realise that they did not
have access to the full text.

When this happened (for whatever reason), it left users
frustrated with the experience of using e-books.

“You don’t get the whole book that often, so it’s part of
the book.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

E-books user research Page 27 of 47



“There was a while where the e-books weren’t compatible
with the internet explorer. So … you could only get so far
in it.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

E-books user research Page 28 of 47



3.4. Behaviour

3.4.1 There are big differences in how
frequently people use healthcare library service
e-books

Some participants told us they rarely or never accessed e-books.

“I know that they’re available! But that’s really all I know
about them.” - Non-user, Wales

And we heard from occasional and regular users.

“I would say probably if I’m on enquiries then I’d probably
use them every other day or so. Probably at least a week
or every two weeks.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

While some users rely upon access to e-books on a daily basis
as part of their role.

“On a daily basis I would say we use electronic books.” -
E-books user, Scotland

3.4.2 Not all users choose e-books over paper
books

Some (but not all) participants in our research expressed a
preference for e-books over other formats.

Users’ choice between paper and electronic texts sometimes
came down to personal preference. For example, we heard
about a preference for the feel of flicking through a physical
book.

“The Maudsley Guidelines, it’s a resource you’d rather be
holding a book, flicking back and forth. The information
you need might be spread throughout the book and you

E-books user research Page 29 of 47



might be having to go on various chapters.” - E-books
user, Northern Ireland

Some users referred to specific barriers to using e-books. For
example, a lack of confidence about using electronic texts, or
being unable to access the books needed in electronic form.

“Some of the resources that I have here are only available
in the print version to me.” - E-books user, Northern
Ireland

“Sometimes I have to get out the paper book to find it ‘cos
sometimes you’ve got too many drop-downs and it’s not
necessarily intuitive as to where it would be.” - E-books
user, England

3.4.3 Users value the ability to use e-books from
any location

We heard that the ability to use an e-book from home, or any
other location, represents a clear advantage over other formats,
affording the flexibility to work outside the office.

This appears to be of increased importance to users as more
people have moved to a hybrid working environment during the
pandemic.

“I can have it wherever I am that I can get my laptop to
work. So yeah, predominantly electronic these days - I
can’t remember when I last looked in the paper BNF to be
fair.” - E-books user, England

“Since the pandemic one of the plusses is I now have a
work laptop so I’ve always got it with me … so if I’m gonna
look something up just put the work laptop on.” - E-books
user, England

“A lot of our staff would spend a day at home doing CPD,
and the thought of having to go to a library to access
books, for them to have that access it’s great.” - E-books
user, Northern Ireland

E-books user research Page 30 of 47



Both users and non-users returned this need as very high in the
user needs validation survey.

UN16: To access e-books outside the office / library so that I
can work from any location

3.4.4 Users appreciate the in-text features that
are an advantage of e-books over other formats

We heard that users value common features enabled by
electronic content.

For example, a number of users referred to the ability to to
highlight text, and annotate content, and navigate through the
text via hyperlinks.

“I don’t like to damage books, I don’t like to write in them,
and actually if you’ve got an electronic version you just
highlight and annotate as you want.” - E-books user,
England

“They are very convenient, and also you can adjust the
size and all these kinds of things.” - E-books user,
Scotland

“If it’s got links in, so for example the BNF now you can go
to the nice treatment summaries from there … so it’s links
to them onto other things and references.” - E-books
user, England

“It’s good to be able to have the chapters at the beginning
so you can go and click on chapters and then you get the
section of those chapters … so you can go and access the
information immediately.” - E-books user, Northern
Ireland

E-books user research Page 31 of 47



3.4.5 Many users find the ability to copy and
paste from e-books a useful feature

We heard that the ability to copy and paste text, in particular,
helps users to work more efficiently, and save time.

And we heard that the ability to copy and paste can help users
to reduce errors in their work, removing the need for manually
copying information or data from printed text.

“[If] I have a print edition book I’m having to free-type and
that’s time-consuming, but it can also produce an
element of risk - if you mistype something …. So copy and
pasting is safer.” - E-books user, Northern Ireland

“It makes it much easier then as well if you’re looking for
tables or graphs or anything like that, you can pull them
from the books then directly.” - E-books user, Ireland

3.4.6 Being able to search within texts is cited as
an important time-saving feature

A number of users we talked to referred to the ability to search
the content of an e-book more easily that other formats.

If users know what to search for they can often find what they
need more quickly in an electronic content, compared to a
printed book.

“If you don’t know what chapter it’s in … if you’ve got the
sort of book where you can search for a term that can be
really helpful ‘cos you can find … what you want in a
chapter you maybe wouldn’t have expected it.” - E-books
user, England

“The search function can be quite good, you know if
you’re looking for a particular phrase or you’re able to
filter out and find exactly what you’re looking for.

E-books user research Page 32 of 47



Whereas in a printed text that could take a bit longer.” -
E-books user, Northern Ireland

3.5. Nation and roles

3.5.1 There may be different levels of awareness
in different nations and different regions

It appears from our qualitative research that awareness of
healthcare library service e-books may not be uniform across
different geographical areas.

“If you’re telling me that there’s an e-book that I can
access … then I would be very happy! I would love it that I
could actually download it.” - Non-user, Ireland

“Didn’t know about them … Please raise awareness about
e-books.” - Non-user, Northern Ireland Ireland, user
needs validation survey

There appear to be differences in awareness between the five
nations. And our research suggests that there may be
differences between e-book awareness between regions within
nations.

However, it is difficult for us to draw strong conclusions on
these differences due to the relatively small sample size of our
qualitative research, and the participation levels in our research
(see 1.5.1).

3.5.2 Users want to know that they’re accessing
the same range of texts as their peers in other
areas

Some users expressed a desire for the same range of e-books to
be available to users, wherever they are located.

For some this would have very practical advantages.

“[I] would like to have access to the minimum resources
recommended by UK Medicines Information to enable my

E-books user research Page 34 of 47



medicines team to answer queries.” - Non-user, England,
user needs validation survey

“I haven’t got access to this e-book … and you would need
to find another organisation who have got access and ask
them if they’ll look it up … that’s a bit of a hassle and often
it’s just too slow.” - E-books user, England

Others referred to a perception of fairness. They questioned why
some users should have the advantage of access to a greater
range of content, depending on their location.

3.5.3 Medicines information pharmacists are
most likely to have integrated e-books into their
role

From the relatively small sample of individuals involved in our
qualitative research it seems that medicines information
pharmacists are the most likely group to have routinely
integrated e-books into their role.

“Every day. I look in the [e-version of the] BNF every day.”
- E-books user, England

4 Validating the user needs
4.1 Analysis method and outputs

23 user needs were scored by users on a range from 0 - I have
no need to 4 - I definitely need to…

(Example) …access a list of available e-books so I know what is
available to me

Each need was then categorised into Very High, High, Medium
and Low priority user needs depending on the average score of
the responses.

Please refer to the full data contained within the user needs
validation survey analysis spreadsheet for more detail about the
scoring the user needs.

The levels of user need (amongst users of e-books) are shown in
the chart below:

Image: Bar chart presenting the levels of need for healthcare library service e-books
users

E-books user research Page 36 of 47



The level of response to the user needs validation survey was
very good. We had 321 complete responses, with 212 of these
from healthcare library service e-books users and 109 from
non-users.

4.2 Non-users recorded a lower level of need
than users

The focus of the bulk of our analysis from the survey was on the
level of need amongst e-book users, as non-users are recording
a projected - rather than actual - level of need.

The levels of user need (amongst non-users) are shown in the
chart below:

Image: Bar chart presenting the levels of need for non-users

Whilst non-users returned a lower level of need than users, the
needs which came back as high amongst non-users are
consistent with those of e-book users. For example, the most
highly ranked need amongst non-users - ‘I need to access a list

E-books user research Page 37 of 47



of available e-books so I know what is available to me’ - was also
one of the highest amongst users of healthcare library service
e-books.

4.3 Users from Northern Ireland recorded a
higher level of need than those from Wales

Unfortunately we did not have an adequate amount of
responses to the user needs validation survey from users of
e-books in England (27 responses), Scotland (21 responses) and
Ireland (8 responses) to validate the needs of these users. We
did, however, gain an adequate number of users from Northern
Ireland (119) and Wales (37).

The levels of user need of e-books users from Northern Ireland
and Wales are shown in the chart below:

Image: Bar chart presenting the levels of need for users in Wales and Northern
Ireland

E-books user research Page 38 of 47



As the chart shows, there is little difference in terms of levels of
need among users from Wales and Northern Ireland. Users
from Northern Ireland have a slightly higher level of need than
those from Wales. However it is also important to underscore
the fact that we had vastly different sample sizes from the two
nations - with three times as many respondents from Northern
Ireland as Wales.

4.4 There emerged a high level of need for a
range of user needs

Amongst users of e-books a total of 8 needs were rated as very
high. This clearly indicates a high level of need amongst users of
e-books.

Needs which were ranked very highly encompassed a range of
topics. For example texts being up-to-date, having an effective
search function, greater visibility about what is available, and
the ability to download and access an e-text wherever you are.

The highest ranked needs amongst users were:

I need to access e-books outside the office / library so that I
can work from any location

I need be able to search for e-book titles so that I can find
results that are directly relevant to me

I need to have unrestricted access to an e-book so that I can
read the full text when I need it

These findings align closely with those of our qualitative
research. Accessing e-books from outside the office, and the
ability to search for available e-book titles are both important
benefits of electronic texts. Having unrestricted access to these
texts represents an important pain point.

5. Prioritising the user story
backlog

The evidence from the user needs validation survey and the
user research interviews was used by the members of the
healthcare library services team from across NHS England, NHS
Scotland, NHS Wales, HSC Northern Ireland and HSE Ireland to
directly inform their initial round of user needs prioritisation.
The final list contained 29 prioritised needs.

The prioritised backlog of user needs is available as an output of
this user research (see Annex 2).

E-books user research Page 40 of 47



6. Proto personas
User personas help provide content for user needs, enabling a
better understanding of the people that use services and
products so you can make better informed decisions about how
to improve these services.

With this in mind, we produced 5 proto personas based on our
research:

1) Sarah the social worker

2) Richard the research-user

3) Paula the pharmacist

4) Emily the educator

5) Nancy the non-user

These are based on the research interviews, findings from the
user needs validation survey, and the user workshop.

We have tried to bring each persona to life - giving them a
name, describing some background information about them
and their work context. Each persona also details their digital
proficiency and their goals and aspirations.

These personas help to teese out the different ways in which
healthcare library service e-books are used (and, in the case of
Nancy, why they’re not used) and what individuals need from
them.

These user personas are included as an output of the research
(see Annex 2).

E-books user research Page 41 of 47



7. User experience mapping
During the user research we mapped out user journeys for four
different user roles:

1) CPD and training users

2) Research users

3) Medical enquiry users

4) Teaching users

In particular, these journey maps highlight that there are several
different motivations behind accessing healthcare library service
e-books. As shown in the maps, there are a number of different
key pain points experienced by users.

It is important to further note that a significant number of users
access e-books for a number of different reasons - therefore it is
likely that individuals may go through a number of journeys
across the 4 different maps.

NB: The first journey on the medical enquiries map came out of
the user research workshop.

PDFs of each of the journey maps are available as an output of
the research (see Annex 2).
