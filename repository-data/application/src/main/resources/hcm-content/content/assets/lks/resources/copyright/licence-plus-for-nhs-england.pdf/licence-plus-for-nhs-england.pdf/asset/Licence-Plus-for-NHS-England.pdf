 and the carers or guardians of patients, the non-exclusive right, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the following clauses to: 

2.1.1 make, or permit the making of, Paper Copies and to distribute, or permit the distribution of, such Paper Copies to Authorised Persons; 

2.1.2 scan, or permit the scanning of, Material Licensed for Scanning to produce Digital Copies provided that, subject to Clause 6, the Licensee shall use  
 reasonable endeavours to identify whether it subscribes to a digital version of the work in question and, if so, to use that digital version instead of  
 creating a Digital Copy by scanning; 

2.1.3 make available, or permit the making available of, Digital Copies, in both cases either i) solely to Authorised Persons and (subject to Clause 2.1.6) to  
 patients, and the carers or guardians of patients, within the Secure Network; or ii) only to the extent permitted in accordance with the limitations of  
 Clause 5.3, on the Licensee Website. This includes, for the avoidance of doubt, the indexing, searching, opening, viewing, printing and presentation 
 or display in electronic form of Digital Copies as is reasonably necessary for the ordinary use and operation of the Licensee’s Secure Network (but

 beyond that permitted by Clause 7;

 Kingdom and to external advisers in connection with the preparation and presentation of such applications or filings as required by law or by the 
 rules of such regulatory authority provided that any such Licensed Copy shall: (i) contain a Copyright Notice; and (ii) identify the publisher, author 
 and/or creator of the literary or artistic work(s) included within the Licensed Copy and, where the Licensed Copy includes Digital Material, the 
 Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of that Digital Material; 

2.1.6 distribute a single Paper Copy to patients, or to the carers or guardians of patients, or, alternatively, make available, or permit the making available  
 of, Digital Copies to patients, or to the carers or guardians of patients, (as set out in Clause 2.1.3) in either case for the personal use only of such  
 patients, or carers or guardians of patients, provided that (i) each such Digital Copy shall contain a Copyright Notice and express wording stating 
 that the Digital Copy may be printed out only once and must not be placed on the publicly accessible Internet or a publicly accessible website or 
 online application and (ii) no rights for any use beyond that set out in (i) are granted hereunder and the permitted acts under Clause 5.3 shall not

 the terms and conditions set out below and the Supply Service Terms. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Supply Service Terms and the   
 remainder of this Agreement the latter shall take precedence.

 the supply of the Content shall be addressed with the Supply Service in accordance with the Supply Service Terms.

 to, an original or a copy on which it has paid a copyright fee (which shall include material supplied in either hardcopy or electronic form by a supplier   
 licensed by CLA to provide such a service such as, but without limitation, document delivery and press cuttings suppliers) of any Licensed Material it copies,

magazine or other periodical, the Licensee shall ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that copying is limited to small extracts that are equivalent to the 
limits set out above, at all times bearing in mind in particular the requirement contained in Clause 4.5 that no copying shall substitute for the purchase of 
original Licensed Material. 

4.3 Licensed Copies of the same Licensed Material made for a single occasion or purpose shall be treated as 1 copy and Clause 4.2 interpreted accordingly.

4.4 Licensed Copies may not be sold or otherwise disposed of (whether or not for valuable consideration) nor rented nor loaned to any third party or used for

 any other use of an original artistic work within Licensed Material. 

4.6 Licensed Copies may not be made or used for the delivery of education or training to third parties by the Licensee but may be made and used for the training  
 of Authorised Persons provided that the Licensee shall not receive as consideration any payment or any other form of remuneration.

 necessary to make the Digital Copies i) perceptible on a computer screen to an Authorised Person; or ii) solely as permitted by clause 5.3) available on the  
 Licensee Website. Electronic notation superimposed on, or electronic marking-up of, a Digital Copy which clearly distinguishes such notation or marking-up  
 from the original text (such as by the use of different colours) shall not be a breach of this condition.

5.2 Except as may be permitted by Clauses 4.7, 5.1 and 9 no digital manipulation, morphing, colour or shade adjustment or any other form of manipulation, may  
 be made of Digital Copies or Digital Material under the Licence.

 indirectly by hypertext links (or the like) to or from any external or third party website or online application except as permitted as follows: i) where an 
 article within a Digital Copy of a journal is accompanied by an abstract indicating the contents of the article, that abstract, but not the contents of the 
 article, may be made available on the Licensee Website; ii) each such use of each abstract must be made available with a hypertext link to the full text of the 
 article whenever reasonably available but, when not, with a full citation of the article instead; iii) access to an abstract cannot be made available behind a 
 paywall, under a subscription, in return for on-demand payment or registration or charged for or restricted in any other way; and iv) all other conditions 
 applicable to Digital Copies hereunder shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the above, abstracts accompanying articles within the Licensed 
 Material may be copied under the Licence on the same basis as any other Licensed Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 repackaging or distribution, in any form, of Digital Copies, in whole or in part, is permitted.

 where the Digital Material or Material Licensed for Scanning, does not incorporate, or have adjacent to it, the identity of the author or creator of the artistic  
 or literary work, the Licensee shall use reasonable endeavours to ensure that every Digital Copy of that work shall include the identity of such author or creator

5.6 The Licensee may subcontract to third parties the making and the making available of Licensed Copies, provided that:

5.7 For the avoidance of doubt, and with the exception of the Content, nothing in this Licence shall operate to limit any rights which the Licensee may have in  
 relation to the use of material supplied to the Licensee in electronic form under the terms and conditions of that supply. This Agreement is without prejudice 
 to any acts which the Licensee is permitted to carry out by the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as the same may be subsequently 
 re-enacted or amended) it being recognised that such permitted acts must be construed in accordance with the principles set out in Article 9(2) of the Berne 
 Convention, as already reflected in the legislation applicable in the UK.

 they were originally identified as being stored. The Licensee shall not otherwise be entitled to access or use such Digital Copies under the Licence  
 except where necessary for technical backup purposes or where required by law. If so requested in writing by CLA, the Licensee shall certify that it  
 has deleted Digital Copies in compliance with this Clause. 

7.4 The Licensee shall immediately i) cease to make available any Digital Copies on the Licensee Website; and ii) permanently delete from the hard drives of
