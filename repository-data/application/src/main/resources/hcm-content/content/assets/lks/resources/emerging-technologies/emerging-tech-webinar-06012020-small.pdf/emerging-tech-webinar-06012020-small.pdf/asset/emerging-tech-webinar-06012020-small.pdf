The Topol Review and how NHS 

Librarians can help to advance its 

agenda



Objectives:

To enable participants to:

• appreciate the scope of the review, the approach and the principles agreed

• understand the structure of the final report; component elements

• be aware of the Top Technologies expected to impact on healthcare and the 
healthcare workforce over the next 20 years

• Take an overview of recommendations pertinent to information professionals 

• consider the implications for health librarians and knowledge specialists

• consider how health librarians can advance this agenda in the context of 
Knowledge for Healthcare 



The Topol Review: scope

The questions:

1. How are technological developments 

likely to change the roles and functions of 

clinical staff in all professions over the 

next two decades?   

2. What are the implications of these 

changes for the skills required?  

3. What does this mean for the selection, 

curricula, education, training and 

development of current and future NHS 

staff?



Three principles

1. Patients: included as partners and informed about health 
technologies

2. Evidence: The adoption of digital healthcare technologies 
should be grounded in compelling real world evidence of 
clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness, followed by practical 
knowledge transfer throughout the NHS.  The workforce 
needs expertise and guidance to evaluate technology 
applications. A fit-for-purpose, legal and ethical governance 
framework everyone can trust.

3. The gift of time: wherever possible the adoption of new 
technologies should enable staff to gain more time to care

Use case: Telemedicine – Virtual fracture clinics

Case: Fracture clinics at Brighton & Sussex University Hospital

Large and increasing demand on traditional and outdated fracture clinics 
services. New patients are not seeing the right consultant for their injury.

Solution

Introduced a virtual fracture clinic for acute fracture and soft tissue 
injuries. This includes a telephone consultation (combining an orthopaedic 
review and specialist therapist input) and self-management through use of 
online resources.

Outcome

The virtual fracture clinic model is able to monitor and meet adherence to 
fracture clinic guidelines. In 2017, over 50% of the 8,000+ new patient 
fracture clinic appointments were via the virtual fracture clinic and 
discharged after receiving virtual care. This represents a saving for the 
CCG of over £700,000.





Future scenarios: Interventional robotics

Scenario: Colonoscopy 

Robotic colonoscopy, under development at the University 
of Leeds and next to first-in-human trials, is designed to be 
painless and extremely easy to perform.

Roles/functions change

• AI augmentation allows staff (eg primary care clinicians) 
to perform procedures

• Can be performed by clinicians in the community without 
anaesthetic cover or support



• Eddie is now a consultant bioinformatician specialising in 

haematological cancers. 

• Clinical responsibilities include analysing genomic data from live 

tumour cells for new variants that may require a change in 

medication or more targeted treatment.

• Lead member of a research group developing new personalised 

treatments for rare haematological cancers

• Also spends time teaching patient groups and primary care 

physicians in the community, and curating new educational 

resources for patients, clinicians and healthcare scientists

• He has recently applied for the role of NHS Regional Dean for 

Genomic Education.

Personas: Eddie the Bioinformatician in 2029, aged 37



The recommendations

The citizen and the patient

• engaging and educating the public about 
genomics and digital healthcare technologies 
(P1)

• work with patient and carer organisations to 
support patient education (P2)

• needs-based targeted education and support 
through existing patient support provision (HI1)

• NHS online content should be a vital trusted 
source of health information and resourced 
appropriately (DM1)



Investing in the current workforce

Healthcare professionals

• invest in existing workforce to develop specialist digital skills, including the assessment and 
commissioning of digital technologies (DM3) 

• lifelong training should be available to healthcare professionals with continuing support in this 
field (G3)

• educational resources should be developed to educate and train all healthcare professionals 
in: health data; the ethics of AI; critical appraisal and interpretation of AI and robotics (AI&R2)

• healthcare professionals will need to access training resources and educational programmes
in digital healthcare technologies to assess and build their digital readiness. (OD3)

• review the regulation and compliance requirements for new digital healthcare technologies 
(OD9)

• Guidance and training on cyber security, data privacy and data anonymisation. 

• Learning from international healthcare systems. 



Staff should have the opportunity to access information about genomics and 
digital technologies and develop the necessary skills. 

• HEE should establish a new Digital Education Programme (E5)

• Employers must ensure that support for staff to develop and enhance digital 
literacy is built into training programmes, career pathways and placements (E6)

• Professional, Statutory and Regulatory bodies and practitioners need to identify 
the knowledge, skills, professional attributes and behaviours needed for 
healthcare graduates to work in a  technologicallyenabled service, and then 
work with educators to redesign the curricula for this purpose (E7)

• Organisations responsible for employing and training must ensure that current 
and new staff are supported to reach an appropriate level of digital literacy for 
their career stage. (E8)

Education and development of the whole workforce



Digital medicine / AI and robotics

The NHS should create or increase the 
numbers of clinician, scientist, technologist and 
knowledge specialist posts with dedicated, 
accredited time, with the opportunity of working 
in partnership with academia and/or the health 
tech industry to design, implement and use 
digital, AI and robotics technologies. 
(DM4/AIR5)

“New roles in data 

science, data security, 

ethics, human factors, 

implementation science, 

and interdisciplinary 

collaborations with 

EPSRC centres, doctoral 

training programmes and 

the Alan Turing Institute”



Organisational development

Health System

• assign board-level responsibility for the safe and 
effective adoption of digital healthcare technologies 
at scale (OD4)

• NHS boards should take responsibility for 
knowledge management to enable staff to learn 
from experience: both successes and failures (OD5)

• strengthen systems to disseminate lessons from 
early adoption and share examples (OD6)

“An open and inclusive 

innovation culture, 

prioritising people, an 

agile workforce, 

leadership, governance 

and investment.”



Technology skills and enablement

• Our workforce will be supported and enabled 

by the latest technology and access insights

from real-world data.

• Our leaders must create a culture where 

digitally supported care is the norm, where 

interventions are evaluated using real-world 

data and evidence.

• We will need to attract the best technologists, 

informaticians and data scientists by making 

the NHS a destination employer for people 

with these skills.

• Our approach will be tailored to the needs of 

the individual with a balance between generic 

and more specialist capabilities. 



Three areas for our organisations to consider:

1. Are all Boards aware of the potential that digital technology will have to 
transform the way that healthcare services will be provided?

2. Can we create a movement of clinicians who work using technology alongside 
their clinical skills?

3. 95% of all jobs in the economy are going to require some digital component 
over the next few years. How do we ensure that everyone who works in health 
and care has the appropriate awareness so that those technological changes 
can be embraced by all of us into the future?



Our role in developing a digitally capable workforce



Education: meeting the NHS educational challenge

• The NHS 1.4M staff

• 90% of all jobs will require digital skills in 20 years

• Develop a programme of digital education

• New professional roles

• Educational provision that is appropriately personalised

• Comprehensive learner profile

• Enable and support returners

• Provide time for staff to learn and train

• Make learning fun, exciting and (even) addictive



Digital literacy for an evolving healthcare workforce

“There is a need to raise awareness of genomics and digital literacy among 
the health and social care workforce. The latter requires the development of 
the skills, attitudes and behaviours that individuals require to become 
digitally competent and confident. 

The levels of digital literacy, the workforce’s awareness of the required 
capability, access to training and support, and skills to enable patients and 
citizens to improve health and wellbeing through technology will all need to 
be improved, as a fundamental shift in the balance of skills in the workforce 
takes place over the next two decades. 

This will present new career opportunities for some of the workforce.” 

Topol Review, p10



Digital skills

How will we gain, and what roles will 
we play in delivering the two different 
types of skills required?

1. Digital skills – the technical skills 
required to use digital 
technologies.

2. Digital navigation skills - a wider 
set of skills needed to succeed in 
the digital world. These include 
finding information, prioritising 
information and assessing the 
quality and reliability of 
information.

Our role in developing 
information, health and digitally literate citizens



Literacy: 1 in 6 adults is functionally illiterate

• 16% adults in England are functionally 
illiterate - literacy levels at or below 
those expected of an 11-year-old

• 21% of Britain’s population lack the 
basic digital skills and capabilities 
required to realise the benefits of the 
internet

• Just under 10% of the adult 
population may never be able to gain 
basic digital capabilities, because of 
disabilities or basic literacy skills.

• Where is our role? How can we 
contribute?

Health literacy: the challenge

• 42% of working-age adults are 
unable to understand or make use 
of everyday health information.

• This rises to 61% where numeracy 
skills are involved 
(Rowlands,2015)

• 43% of working-age adults will 
struggle to understand instructions 
to calculate a childhood 
paracetamol dose 
(Rowlands,2014)

How will knowledge services change? 



Re-imagining knowledge services 

1. Much of this is about extending the reach of the work we already do

2. Are we anticipating changes in user needs and preferences?

3. What does it means for the design and delivery of health knowledge services?

4. What does technological change mean for the information products that deliver 
knowledge for healthcare?



Fundamental changes in ways of working 



Harnessing AI
• Using AI to help people formulate questions

• And to conduct literature searches

• Building technical infrastructure so 
collections are accessible by APIs and can 
be used by machine-learning algorithms

• To analyse library tasks and workflows

• Using AI to teach information literacy and 
critical-thinking skills 

• How will we evaluate algorithms for bias?

• Helping people consider the impact of 
surveillance and AI on their lives

Re-imagining roles: questions to ask ourselves?

1. How do we ensure that health library and knowledge services staff have the 
awareness and skills to enable our services to embrace technological changes?

2. How confident are we of the digital capabilities of library and knowledge services 
staff?

3. How will we build the digital capabilities of our specialist workforce? 

4. How do we redesign our workforce for knowledge services? 

5. What will the roles of health librarians, information professionals and knowledge 
managers be like in 2029? How do we build our talent pipeline? 

6. What are we doing now to prepare?
