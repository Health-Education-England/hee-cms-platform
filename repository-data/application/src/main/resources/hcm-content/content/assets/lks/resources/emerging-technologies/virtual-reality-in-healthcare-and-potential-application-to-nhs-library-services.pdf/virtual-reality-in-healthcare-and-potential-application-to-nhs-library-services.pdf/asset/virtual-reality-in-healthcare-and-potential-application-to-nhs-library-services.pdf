Seeing conditions from Patient Perspective



“It has virtually opened my eyes to how I 
understand what it is the patient needs to 

hear and the tone I use to deliver it ”

“I often forget how my actions and words 
could be interpreted by patients. I can 

become the patient and realise how it feels 
to be in their shoes”

“This is powerful. I have no doubt this will 
help us approach and take better care of ill 

patients” 

“These experiences provide a unique opportunity 
for  healthcare professionals to empathise with 

their patients and improve the patient experience

“This virtual tool helps me to better 
understand how we can be more sensitive to 

the patient’s needs.”

VR Tech is changing rapidly and there are lots of options, but VR isn’t new…

Interactive 360 Video allows user to jump between perspectives



Our VR Lab – For more high fidelity 
experiences and group work



Sharecare VR with mixed reality output (using greenscreen to 
overlay the virtual image with the real)



VR Patient Intervention – Very rewarding but must be appropriate
and care taken (hygiene, comfort, effects, ethics, research)



Relevant Limitations 

• Headsets need to be centrally located with an appropriate booking / loan system, 
which allows users to explore the platform in their own time

• Staff ‘champions’ need to familiarise themselves with the technology (and 
importantly it’s limitations) in order to have technical confidence to then drive ideas 
and uptake in their own areas. This role is vital as they bring an authentic voice to 
genuine opportunities. 

• Battery life on the Oculus Go and mobiles phones used for Samsung Gear VR and 
Google Cardboard is limited and the devices have to be regularly recharged.

• The halo effect is another issue we have encountered. Few participants for various 
studies have had a negative experience of using VR in some other context and 
therefore have developed negative reactions to the use of VR headsets. 

• Novelty effect towards a new audio visual modality might also be at play and should 
be considered when taking participants’ feedback into consideration

• Limited funding has restricted every department or team having their own 
equipment. 

• Suitable experiences need to be curated.

• Hygiene – headsets need to be cleaned (wipes) between different users)  



Application In Libraries

• Staff education & information

- Virtual anatomy / Reference 
- Healthcare processes (virtual clinical environments,
patient condition perspectives)
-Explanation & narrative experiences (journey
of cells,  birth process, living with cancer, notes on 
blindness)

• Staff and public wellbeing 

- Meditative environments/exercises 
- Anxiety reduction 
- Creative pursuits (3D art, Visualising music) 
- Virtual locations (Google Earth) 

Within the context of libraries, VR as a route to learning is fairly untapped, yet offers 
an ideal location for staff access and engagement



Virtual Wellbeing

• Oculus Go £199  - Ideal for narrative and 
information experiences. Links to mobile phone to 
make navigation easier.  Is good for passive or sit 
down experiences, such as 360 videos or 
meditation. 

• Oculus Quest £399  - Latest headset that is high 
medium end, completely independent from other 
hardware. Needs space to operate as it is a motion 
tracked headset (2.5m x 2m). Great for arts, 
creative, reference and compatible with wellbeing 
experiences.

Evaluation of VR 
interventions



• Primarily there are two types of VR interventions in healthcare-
technical and non-technical (clinical communication).

• In our VR evaluation techniques review (in progress), we discovered 
that over 90% of the VR in healthcare interventions focus on technical 
skills

• Within literature there is a lack of consistency in research designs as 
most studies are one-off, use different VR devices and employ variety 
of different interventions. VR is a difficult TEL tool to evaluate 
(Feinstein & Cannon 2001). Different VR devices deliver different 
experiences that are healthcare context specific, which can make it 
challenging to formulate an evaluation design that can be replicated 
across a variety of different interventions.



Evaluation methods

• The evaluation methods for VR interventions can clustered into two 
groups- learning/skills outcomes (efficacy of 
intervention) and usability/feasibility/acceptability (user experience 
of intervention)

• Learning/Skills outcomes measurements- Often use domain specific 
skills based on metrics provided by individual VR systems such as 
Immersion Lap VR or Eyesi. Often researchers design their own user 
skills/competencies assessments. However, validated scales such as 
the manual skill assessment using ESCAPA (Rahm et al. 2016), GRS 
Objective Assessment of Arthroscopic Skills (Chang et al. 2016), 
OSATS questionnaire (Nickel et al. 2015), the Oldenburg Burnout 
Inventory questionnaire (Pan et al. 2016), and Abelson et al.’s (2015) 
Bedford Workload Scale and NASA Task Load Index scale are used



Evaluation methods

• Usability/Feasibility/Acceptability-Majority of the studies design 
their own user opinions and perceptions of the VR experience 
surveys. Some clinical communication studies have used validated 
scales such as Marc Hassenzahl’s AttrakDiff2 for UX assessment 
(Albrecht et al. 2013b) , NEO big five personality inventory 
questionnaire (Pan et al. 2016) and Profile of Mood States 
questionnaires (Albrecht et al. 2013b).

• Within general VR literature often HCI based validated scales are used 
to evaluate VR such as Nielsen’s interface evaluation heuristics 
(Nielsen 1995), user presence (Sanchez-Vives & Slater 2005; Sutcliffe 
& Gault 2004b) and Witmer & Singer's (1994) presence 
questionnaire. These can also be used within healthcare VR context
