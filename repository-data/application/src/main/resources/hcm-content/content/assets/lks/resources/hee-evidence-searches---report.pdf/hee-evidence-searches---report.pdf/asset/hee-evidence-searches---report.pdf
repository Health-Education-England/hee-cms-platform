1. User research overview
1.1. Executive summary

This user research was conducted by Lagom Strategy between
April and June 2021.

The research focussed on the needs of people who request
evidence searches from their NHS Knowledge and Library
service.

Users of evidence search services are a broad group, covering a
number of different job roles including healthcare professionals,
managers and commissioners. They request evidence search
services for a range of reasons such as informing service
development, research, and clinical practice.

Users of these services emphasised the importance of being
able to access current evidence to support evidence-led work,
and indicated that requesting expert searches from a librarian is
a vital part of this. These services are highly valued by users,
who often have close working relationships with specific
librarians.

Our research highlights users’ satisfaction with evidence search
services. While users expressed a desire to see these services
used more widely, librarian capacity may be a barrier to this.

The research has concluded with a validated, and prioritised
user story backlog which can be used to inform HEE decisions
about how to proceed with evidence search services.

The key research findings of this report are organised by the
following themes:

◆ 2.3.1. Context

◆ 2.3.2. Requesting searches

Evidence search services user research Page 5 of 47



◆ 2.3.3. Search results

◆ 2.3.4. Satisfaction

1.2. User research goals
At the start of the research we agreed on these goals with the
Health Education England team:

1. Understand who ‘users of evidence-search services’
actually are

2. Understand and articulate the common scenarios and
user journeys for users of evidence-search services

3. Identify the user needs in those scenarios

4. Understand how users currently meet these needs

a. How do they approach expressing their search
needs?

b. What are the current range of processes, tools and
systems that they use?

5. Understand how well they meet these needs?

a. What do they think about what they are getting?

b. How much digesting/summarising and synthesising
do they expect/need?

c. What format do they need information in?

d. How do they use the evidence they get?

e. Do they have unmet needs?

6. Why do they do it this way? E.g. training, access to tools,
available licences

7. Validate the significance and impact of those needs to
users of evidence-search services

Evidence search services user research Page 6 of 47



8. Prioritise which of these needs should be met by HEE and
evidence-search services

1.3. The scope of the user research
The scope of the work was limited to understanding the needs
of people who request literature and evidence searches from
their NHS Knowledge and Library service.

It builds on previous research into the needs of non-expert
searchers and expert searchers, which was used to inform
decisions about national discovery services.

This work provides findings from the research, rather than
making any recommendations about how to proceed.

1.7. Background to this user research
Health Education England wants to better understand what
end-users want from evidence-search services.

End users make search requests to library services in the NHS.
This research has been designed to understand why they use
the services, how they express their search needs, what they
think about the results they get back, and any unmet needs.

This work is related to, and complementary to, two previous
pieces user research:

◆ National Discovery services (April 2019)

◆ Expert searchers (March 2020)

The work will inform decisions about the ways in which the
needs of end users are met.

2. User research
2.1. Method

Our researchers consulted with a range of users during the user
research to explore their context, needs, emotions, and
behaviours.

2.1.1. Qualitative research
◆ 13 one-to-one interviews with user representatives

◆ 4 user participants in a user needs workshop including
journey mapping

◆ Observed 5 participants in observational sessions

◆ Reviewed open text comments in 342 online survey
responses

2.1.2. Quantitative research

■ 342 respondents to the online user needs survey

Note: due to time restraints, surveys were online, with links
cascaded digitally. It is appreciated that this may bring a bias
toward users with a higher level of digital literacy. This was
considered when interpreting the results.

Evidence search services user research Page 10 of 47



2.2. User roles
The user research explored these user roles, identified during
the inception phase:

2.2.1. Primary roles

2.2.1.1. Healthcare professionals

◆ Doctors
◆ Nurses
◆ Allied health professionals
◆ Technical professionals
◆ Clinical scientists
◆ Pharmacists

2.2.1.2. Healthcare managers

◆ Medical directors
◆ HR
◆ C-level managers

2.2.1.3. Commissioners

Evidence search services user research Page 11 of 47



2.3. Key findings from the user research

2.3.1. Context

2.3.1.1. Users have a consistent range of reasons for
requesting searches

While there are several different reasons why a user may need
to request a search, these were relatively consistent across the
users we spoke to.

Users described requesting searches for their research, for
example to support studies they were conducting.

“I’ve used it for research, I’ve used it to support studies,
for literature searches” - Healthcare professional

“I’ve just done a couple of projects which have required
literature searches” - Healthcare professional

Some request searches to inform service development.

“As we’re developing services, or undertaking service
reviews, I would sometimes use a literature review to
inform those pieces of work” - Commissioner

Other reasons for requesting searches included needing
evidence to support decisions around patient care.

“We’ve had a patient that’s come to our service that’s got
a very unique condition, and we want to find out more
[...] or other people who have presented similar cases or
have treated similar patients” - Healthcare professional

“I know some of my bosses need it for difficult clinical
cases” - Healthcare professional

In the validation survey users were asked about their reasons
for requesting evidence searches. Users were presented with a

Evidence search services user research Page 12 of 47



range of options and were able to choose more than one
option.

This graph further highlights that many users are requesting
evidence searches for a range of reasons:

Image: graph showing users’ reasons for requesting searches

Users were also able to specify any other reasons why they
requested searches.

Responses included requesting searches to support their
learning on Masters modules, commissioning decisions,
updating policies, and personal reasons.

Examples of personal reasons for requesting searches included
finding information about how Covid affects people with a
particular health condition.

Evidence search services user research Page 13 of 47



2.3.1.2 Users feel it is important to have current evidence to
inform their work

When describing the reasons for requesting evidence searches,
users often talked about the importance of having current
evidence to inform and guide their work.

“I have to feel that I’m on the cusp of knowledge” -
Healthcare professional

“We should be data-led, should be evidence-led” -
Manager

“It helps to provide evidence-based treatment to patients.
And that is so important” - Healthcare professional

2.3.1.3. The frequency with which searches are requested
varies between users

We found that users have different behaviours when it comes to
how frequently they are requesting searches.

Some users are requesting searches relatively frequently.

“It could be 2, 3, 4, times in a period of a month or two [...]
other times it could be a lot less” - Healthcare
professional

“I would say probably once a month” - Healthcare
professional

For others, requesting a search is a rarer occurrence.

“Probably every 6 months or so” - Commissioner

“I’ve only done 2 searches in the 2 years I’ve been here” -
Healthcare professional

In the validation survey, users were asked about how frequently
they request evidence searches, for example whether they
request these rarely or frequently.

The chart below highlights that there was a relatively even split
between users who frequently and occasionally request

Evidence search services user research Page 14 of 47



searches, with a smaller proportion of users specifying that they
rarely request evidence searches.

We also heard from a small proportion of non-users who never
request searches.

Other respondents stated that they had made use of this service
in the past but did not currently use it, they frequently ran their
own searches, or had not previously heard of this service.

Image: chart showing frequency of users’ search requests

2.3.1.4. Some users also carry out their own searches

In addition to making use of literature and evidence search
services, some users are carrying out their own searches.

“Sometimes I’ll do my own searches” - Healthcare
professional

“I always try to do the search myself initially” - Manager

Evidence search services user research Page 15 of 47



“I do both [own searches and request searches] just as
good practice now” - Healthcare professional

Different factors influence whether a user decides to run a
search themselves or ask a librarian.

Some users very rarely, if ever, carry out their own searches,
and will ask a librarian to search for them because they are not
confident in their own searching skills.

“I just find it really difficult and of course all the ways of
doing it keep changing and so I’ll completely honest with
you, I ask [librarian]” - Healthcare professional

Some users will attempt to run a search themselves initially, and
then request a search from a librarian if they are unable to find
the information they are looking for.

“If I can’t quite nail the key words or what it is that I’m
looking for then I’ll go to a human being” - Manager

Others are able to do some of their own searching, but tend to
request searches from librarians when the task is particularly
important and they need to be sure that the search will be
thorough and systematic.

“It depends on how important the task is, the more
important it is then I’ll ask the library to do it” -
Healthcare professional

This reflects one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to request a search from a
librarian so that I can be confident that my search will be
done to a high professional standard.”

This was validated with a high level of need and was prioritised
as a need that the service MUST meet.

Evidence search services user research Page 16 of 47



2.3.2. Requesting searches

2.3.2.1. Most users are able to easily contact a librarian

Most of the users we spoke to can easily contact a librarian
when they need to request a search.

Some work in teams that have a dedicated librarian.

“I’ve been lucky in that I’ve always worked in teams that
had specific [library] resource” - Manager

Others noted that it was easy to get in touch with a librarian via
email.

“I think they’re fairly accessible. You can send them an
email at any time” - Healthcare professional

“I’ve got them [library team] all in my address box now so
I know exactly who I’m contacting” - Healthcare
professional

However, not everyone finds it easily to access library services.
We heard that some staff may not have access to a librarian,
and others were unsure about how to get in touch with their
library services.

“Many do not have access to a librarian” - Survey
respondent

“I’ve just logged onto our current Trust’s intranet. I can’t
even see a library service on here. I mean there probably
is one. There will be one. I just can’t, that just shows how
difficult it is to access” - Healthcare professional

2.3.2.2. Many users described a relatively informal process
for requesting searches

Several users described being able to request a search by
simply emailing a known member of the library team.

Evidence search services user research Page 17 of 47



“I just tend to email [the librarian]” - Healthcare
professional

“I just email her. So it’s a very sort of informal process” -
Healthcare professional

Some users have requested searches over the phone or
through Teams.

“Normally it would be that I would drop her an email. In
the olden days we might meet in person, in the new
world it might be Teams” - Healthcare professional

“I would pick up the phone” - Manager

Other users described a more structured process, and are
submitting their search requests via online forms. However, we
heard that these online forms are not always easy to use.

“It is not particularly easy to complete the form that the
library provide when requesting a literature and evidence
search” - Survey respondent

“The form itself isn’t too difficult to use, it’s more how we
use it I think” - Healthcare professional

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to easily communicate with the
librarian (e.g. via email or form) when I initially request a
search so that I can provide them with the details of the
search (e.g. disease, treatment, patient age).”

This was validated with a high level of need and was prioritised
as a need that the service MUST meet.

2.3.2.3. The information that users provide when requesting
a search is consistent

Users are asked for the same types of information when they
request a search.

They are asked for the context around the search.

Evidence search services user research Page 18 of 47



“The context of the piece of work I’m undertaking, what
specific search I’m looking for, some keywords” -
Commissioner

“I usually give them what I’m looking for and then I give
them the context of why I’m looking for it” - Manager

They are asked for information about research questions and
inclusion criteria.

“I would usually contact the library and say this is the
question we’re trying to answer, do you think you could
run a search, these are the kind of inclusion criteria, these
are the dates etc.” - Healthcare professional

Users may also provide initial search terms as part of their
request.

“I normally will give them some search terms based on
PICO, basically to help them have a rough idea of what I
want” - Healthcare professional

“I usually give them what I’m looking for and then I give
them the context of why I’m looking for it” - Healthcare
professional

2.3.2.4. Users often discuss timescales with the librarian
when requesting a search

Users described how part of the conversation around
requesting a search involves setting a timeframe for the search.

“They [librarians] do ask me what time span, when do I
require the results” - Healthcare professional

As part of this, users specify whether or not the search results
are needed urgently.

“Generally I go it’s not urgent because I’m not gonna get
round to it for ages, or I might say it’s actually for a
current patient, can you try and do it quicker” -
Healthcare professional

Evidence search services user research Page 19 of 47



“We’d normally agree a date of when we might need this
by as well so that [librarian] can know sort of where it sits
in her priorities” - Healthcare professional

By agreeing on a timeframe for the search, users have an idea
of when they can expect to receive their search results.

“They will always say I will get it to you in such and such a
timeframe, is that ok [...] they set expectations” -
Manager

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to set a timeframe when
requesting a search so that I can tell the librarian how
quickly I need to receive the results.”

This was validated with a medium level of need, and was
prioritised as a need that the service MUST meet.

2.3.2.5. Users occasionally need to refine their searches
after submitting the initial request

Users noted that an initial conversation with the librarian when
requesting a search was often enough for them to progress with
the search without the need for refinements later on.

“I have a couple of times but that’s probably because I’ve
not been clear what I’ve been asking for” - Healthcare
professional

“Occasionally but not very often. Like I say they are very
good, they’re kind of switched on” - Healthcare
professional

When refinements are needed, users discuss these with the
librarian carrying out the search.

For example, users may receive questions from the librarian if
more information is needed to refine or progress with a search.

“They [librarians] will send you emails if they’ve got any
extra questions” - Healthcare professional

Evidence search services user research Page 20 of 47



“If she either finds that she’s finding no information she
might ask us about how we could widen the search, or if
there’s too much information, if there’s anything that we
can help to narrow the topic” - Healthcare professional

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to easily communicate with the
librarian (e.g. via email, phone or Teams) and ask or answer
questions about my search so that the search can be refined
when necessary.”

This was validated with a medium level of need, and was
prioritised as a need that the service must meet.

2.3.3. Search results

2.3.3.1. Users tend to receive their search results by email,
and in a consistent format

Users expect to receive search results by email, and almost all
users refer to receiving their search results by email rather than
by any other channels.

“I think it’s usually an email” - Healthcare professional

“It’s an attachment on an email” - Healthcare
professional

“She [librarian] tends to send everything through by
email” - Healthcare professional

Although we spoke to users from different NHS Trusts and
different organisations, there was consistency in how their
search results are formatted.

Many users receive their search results as either a Word
document or a PDF document, attached to an email.

“It’s a Word document or a PDF. And there’s links for each
of the papers which is really really useful” - Healthcare
professional

Evidence search services user research Page 21 of 47



“You get an attachment in PDF format” - Healthcare
professional

“Normally for me Word is the best [...] that’s what I tend
to receive it in” - Healthcare professional

Search results documents often include details of the search
strategy as well as the list of abstracts or references that were
found.

“It’s basically how [librarian] devised the search, the
search terms, the databases, and then the list of
abstracts” - Healthcare professional

“You also have the search strategy on the bottom” -
Healthcare professional

We also heard that search results tend to be provided in the
same format, regardless of the type of search that has been
carried out.

“It [format] doesn’t vary to be honest. I’ve been using the
library for quite some time, 15 years” - Healthcare
professional

“It was a template” - Healthcare professional

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to receive my search results in
a format that suits me (e.g. Word, PDF or RIS) so that I can
easily access them.”

This was validated with a very high level of need and was
prioritised as a need that the service MUST meet.

2.3.3.2. Some users value receiving a summary alongside
their results

Some users felt that receiving a summary of what the search
found alongside the list of references was particularly helpful.

Evidence search services user research Page 22 of 47



“I always try and remember to ask for a summary, which
is really really helpful” - Commissioner

“The summary is really helpful as it allows the findings to
be shared more widely with people who don't have time
to read all the research” - Survey respondent

“I expect to receive a concise analysis of the question that
I’ve asked” - Manager

Others did not have a need for this type of summary, and felt
that the list of search results met their needs.

“In terms of what all the papers, what they contain, no I
don’t need that” - Manager

“I really just need the papers” - Healthcare professional

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to receive a summary of the
evidence that the search found so that I can easily see the
answer to my question.”

This was validated with a very high level of need and was
prioritised as a need that the service SHOULD meet.

2.3.3.3. There appear to be different ways in which users set
up and receive updates about relevant literature

Some users spoke about receiving regular updates about
relevant literature. There are a variety of ways in which users
receive these updates.

This user described how they had set up regular HDAS alerts
with the help of a librarian. This means they now receive
automatic updates about their search topic.

“I’m alerted to whatever’s out there really, on HDAS. So
I’ve set that up to automatically run off various
information” - Healthcare professional

Evidence search services user research Page 23 of 47



Other users noted that librarians regularly provide them with
updates when they come across information that is likely to be
relevant.

“She’s actually one step ahead of me now, she’s started
sending me updates in the main things that I ask for so
she’s a mind-reader as well as the original search engine”
- Healthcare professional

“They [librarians] provide me with specific, appropriate
research updates on a regular basis” - Survey
respondent

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to receive regular updates
about new search results so that I can be sure I am up to
date with developments in my field.”

This was validated with a low level of need and was prioritised
as a need that the service SHOULD meet.

2.3.3.4. Users described some level of difficulty with
obtaining full text articles

As we have heard in previous research, access to journals
through subscription continues to be an issue for some users.

“Sometimes it’s a bit difficult to get papers because for
whatever reason, subscriptions etc. you just can’t access
it” - Healthcare professional

“The login we have with the library doesn’t necessarily
allow us access [to some journals]” - Healthcare
professional

Users have to make an additional request (an extra step in the
user journey) in order to access some articles.

However, users were satisfied that librarians helped them to
obtain full text articles when this proved difficult.

Evidence search services user research Page 24 of 47



“I access the library facilities when I am unable to access
papers through my work access” - Survey respondent

“In those situations, the library’s been able to access the
papers and send me the PDF documents” - Healthcare
professional

This relates to one of the user needs from the research:

“As a search requester, I need to easily request papers that
are not included in my NHS or university journal
subscriptions so that I can access all the relevant
information.”

This was validated with a very high level of need and was
prioritised as a need that the service MUST meet.

2.3.3.5. Search results are used in a range of different ways

Users make use of the search results they receive in different
ways.

Some described critiquing abstracts to determine which papers
were likely to be useful to them, and then retrieving the articles.

“Critiquing abstracts, sort of sifting out what’s useful and
what’s not and then retrieving the articles” - Healthcare
professional

Some used the papers that had been identified to inform their
own journal papers.

“It’s just been going through those papers that are
identified, and then producing a paper from it really” -
Healthcare professional

Others forwarded the search results on to their colleagues, who
used the information found in the search to inform their
practice.

Evidence search services user research Page 25 of 47



“I send it to the psychologist, just sort of forward it on,
and then they use it, I suppose it’s to inform practice” -
Healthcare professional

2.3.4. Satisfaction

2.3.4.1. Users are highly satisfied with this service

The users we spoke to tended to be very happy with their
experience of the literature and evidence search services, and
were full of praise for the librarians who run these services.

“You do a great job!” - Survey respondent

“Brilliant service” - Survey respondent

Many users we spoke to were completely satisfied and did not
have any suggestions for how the service could be improved.

“I can get everything I want” - Healthcare professional

“I think search service wise, I don’t think I can add
anything more than what I already have. I think they do a
brilliant job” - Healthcare professional

It should be noted that the majority of people we spoke with
during the research were existing users of evidence search
services.

Speaking to more non-users may reveal additional things that
would need from this service, that were not identified during
this research.

2.3.4.2. Expert searches are highly valued and play an
important role in the NHS

Users value this service and the quality of the searches that they
can obtain through it. Many users expressed that these
searches are a very important part of their work.

Evidence search services user research Page 26 of 47



Users noted that without this service, they would have
difficulties with finding the time to keep up to date with current
evidence.

“I would worry about my capacity to keep up to date with
both current evidence and my workload if their service
was not available” - Survey respondent

Users suggested that they would also find it more difficult to
publish research without this service.

“I think without that help I definitely wouldn’t have been
able to publish the research I have done. So it’s pivotal
really in my career development” - Healthcare
professional

Users also indicated that without this service, they would be
reliant on using other sources of information such as Google
Scholar.

“Not having it, you’re alone and entirely dependent on
Google. And what Google wants to show you” - Manager

Users emphasised the impact that a lack of this service would
have on their work.

“When I’m in the midst of it, then definitely I think a lack
of that service would have a significant impact” -
Healthcare professional

“I would be lost without them” - Commissioner

2.3.4.3. Users feel that this service could be used more
widely

The users we spoke to were very enthusiastic about the benefits
of being able to request literature and evidence searches, and
were keen for this service to be used more widely.

“Service I had was good - made me think I should use it
more often” - Survey respondent

Evidence search services user research Page 27 of 47



“I’m not sure that generally people utilise the service as
much as they could and should do, and I don’t think that
the general population of the organisation know just how
good and how clever they [librarians] are” - Manager

However, it was recognised that more widespread use of the
service could create problems with library capacity.

“I think if we were all perhaps using them more, that
might have a knock on impact on timescales and things” -
Commissioner

2.3.4.4. There are people who could benefit from this service
and are not aware of it

Some users indicated that their libraries do promote the
services that they offer in order to attract more users.

“She [librarian] attends so many meetings, she’s on so
many forums, she’s very articulate on social media, she’s
just out there and people know who she is because she
works hard” - Healthcare professional

“They do lots to make themselves visible and make
people aware of what the services that they offer are” -
Healthcare professional

However, we heard that in some areas, there are people that
could be benefitting from this service who are not aware of it.

“I had no idea the service was even available” - Survey
respondent

“For that very first piece of work, we actually used
Imperial College London [...] And that was probably a lack
of my understanding of what we’d got available in our
system” - Commissioner

“This specific service is actually news to me” - Healthcare
professional

Evidence search services user research Page 28 of 47



“I have never used such services, but would be interested
in finding out whether I have some use cases in my work
for doing so” - Survey respondent

“How much additional help and support could there be
for the areas that don’t yet know it?” - Manager

2.3.4.5. There were very few suggestions for potential
improvements to the service

As noted above in section 2.3.4.1, we heard very few
suggestions for potential improvements to the service.

One suggestion was to encourage staff to participate in journal
clubs as good practice.

“The culture is not to review recent research through
journal clubs [...] I believe my role and expertise would be
enhanced if this was encouraged as good practice” -
Survey respondent

Users noted that having a central repository in which previous
evidence searches could be held would be useful and would
prevent duplicate searches needing to be carried out.

“I sometimes think when I’m asking for a literature review
[...] do they necessarily need to pull all that information
again or is there a central repository where somebody
says these are all the evidence reviews that we’ve done?” -
Commissioner

In line with the feedback about difficulties in accessing some full
text articles, it was suggested that having access to additional
journals would be helpful.

“It’s not the end of the world but it would make life easier,
more access to articles from the login we have with the
library” - Healthcare professional

Users also felt that it would be useful to more easily find policy
and guidance documents from other NHS Trusts.

Evidence search services user research Page 29 of 47



“Being able to sort of see different policies or different
positions at different Trusts would be useful” -
Healthcare professional

Finally, users suggested that the service should be more widely
promoted so that more people can make use of it.

“NHS Library services are excellent but underutilised and
undervalued. More should be done to advertise the
library services available as they have a huge amount to
offer clinicians and researchers” - Survey respondent

“It’s a really good service and I think whatever you can do
to publicise it and encourage others to use it, I think
that’d be great” - Healthcare professional

2.4. Validating the user needs
Survey respondents were invited to validate a list of 12 user
needs identified from the user interviews, remote observation
sessions and a user needs workshop.

Full data is in the User needs validation survey.

342 users completed the user needs validation survey including:

■ 242 healthcare professionals

■ E.g. Consultant, Pharmacist, Midwife, Research
Nurse

■ 53 managers

■ E.g. Associate Director, Medical Director, General
Manager

2.4.1. Analysis method and outputs

12 user needs were scored by users on a range from 0 - I have
no need to 4 - I definitely need to…

(Example) …request a search from a librarian so that I can be
confident that my search will be done to a high professional
standard

Each need was then categorised into Very high, High, Medium
and Low priority user needs depending on the average score
of the responses.

Key: yellow = Low need, orange = Medium need, red = High
need, purple = Very high need

The levels of user need are shown in the chart below:

Evidence search services user research Page 31 of 47



The level of response to the user needs validation survey was
very good.

Healthcare professionals showed a lower level of need than
managers

The survey data showed that healthcare professionals showed a
lower level of need compared to the managers who completed
the survey. While healthcare professionals rated 7 needs as
either MEDIUM or LOW, managers only rated 2 needs as either
MEDIUM or LOW. Similarly, healthcare professionals had 4 VERY
HIGH needs, whereas managers had 7 VERY HIGH needs.

It should be noted here that a number of healthcare
professionals who took part in the survey (e.g. pharmacists)

Evidence search services user research Page 32 of 47



described completing many of their searches themselves which
may have contributed to this lower level of need.

The majority of user stories related to requesting searches
or receiving search results

Of the 16 user needs identified in this discovery:

◆ 5/16 were about requesting searches

◆ 8/16 were about search results

These made up 81% of the total needs.

Of the 12 of these needs that were included in the survey, 8
were either VERY HIGH or HIGH.

Although not all of the needs were validated in the user needs
validation survey, the number of needs and level of need within
these themes demonstrates that these areas are particularly
important to users.

2.5. Prioritising the user story backlog
The evidence from this survey and other user research was
used by the Health Education England team to directly inform
their initial round of user story prioritisation (see output 8:
User stories backlog).

Image: screenshot of the prioritised user stories

Evidence search services user research Page 34 of 47



2.6 Journey mapping
During the user research we mapped out 3 search requester
journeys:

1) Requesting a search for service management

2) Requesting a search for patient care

3) Requesting a search for auditing/quality improvement

The evidence gathered through this process was used to inform
the research findings.

In particular, these journey maps show that there are several
different stages involved in requesting a search. As shown in the
maps, the main role involved in each journey is the librarian.
There may also be involvement from colleagues and
supervisors.

The maps highlight that a range of different tools are used when
requesting searches, including email, phone, and Teams.

The maps also reveal opportunities throughout each journey.

PDFs of each of the journey maps are available as an output of
the research.
