1. User research overview 
1.1. Executive summary 

The user research was conducted by Lagom Strategy (a digital 
user research agency) during  January, February and March 
2020. 

The research focussed on the needs of expert searchers in the 
NHS: individuals who carry out frequent or complex searches to 
support clinical practice, research, service development or 
systematic review. 

Expert searchers are a relatively small group, with a distinct set 
of needs. Most, but not all, expert searchers are professional 
librarians. Some of the needs we identified in this research are 
the particular needs of a niche of this small group. 

Expert searchers deploy their expert skills to find, organise and 
share information. Many use the Healthcare Databases 
Advanced Search (HDAS) to do this, but the skills of expert 
searchers are agnostic of particular tools. They use a range of 
other tools and methods, as well as HDAS. 

Our research highlights satisfaction with HDAS amongst users, 
but it also highlights users’ frustrations. The work also captures 
the evidence about the experience (positive and negative) of 
using other methods, including native interfaces. 

The research identifies a set of distinct expert searcher user 
needs. Of those needs: 

■ a small number of these needs may be met by a future 
national discovery service 

■ some of the needs suggest possible support for expert 
searching that is not currently available or imagined, and 
may or may not be feasible for HEE to meet through 
digital tools 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 3 of 40  



 

■ some of the needs might be met in other ways by HEE, for 
example by learning and development or 
communications. 

The research has concluded with a validated, and prioritised 
user story backlog which can be used to inform HEE decisions 
about how to proceed with services for expert searchers.   

1.2. User research goals 
At the start of the research we agreed on these goals with the 
Health Education England team:  

1. Understand who ‘expert searchers’ actually are 

2. Understand and articulate the common scenarios and 
user journeys 

3. Identify the user needs in those scenarios  

4. Understand how expert searchers currently meet these 
needs  

5. Validate the significance and impact of those needs to 
expert searchers 

6. Prioritise which of these needs can be met by a National 
Discovery Service and which are better met in other ways 

1.3. The scope of the user research 
The scope of the work was limited to understanding the needs 
of expert searchers in the NHS. Expert searchers are defined as 
NHS staff who conduct complex or frequent searches for 
information and knowledge.  

It builds on previous research into the needs of non-expert 
searchers, which was used to inform decisions about national 
discovery services.

The work was delivered in parallel with work conducted by NICE 
to quantify the demand for expert searching by an analysis of 
analytics from the Healthcare Databases Advanced Search 
(HDAS). 

This work provides findings from the research, rather than 
making any recommendations about how to proceed.

1.5. User research activities 
The user research was conducted during  January, February and 
March 2020. 

The activities allowed us to generate the insights in this report 
and the other user research outputs:  

1. Kick-off workshop ​with key project stakeholders  

2. Reviewed online and documentary sources (see Annex I) 

3. Conducted​ 12 one-to-one user interviews  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 5 of 40  



 

4. Ran a ​user needs workshop​ with a range of stakeholders 
and end user role representatives, to generate 
proto-personas and user journey scenarios  

5. Ran a diary study with ​3 participants 

6. Analysis of a​ user needs survey​ with 169 responses 

7. Observed ​3 field visits 

8. Developed a​ journey maps​ for 3 user journeys 

9. Created and prioritised ​30 user stories ​with the HEE 
team 

10. Presented a project ​show-and-tell 

1.5.1. User research participation levels  

Participation levels in the user research activities were 
satisfactory for the level needed for a thorough user research 
process.  

1.6. Key associated documents 
■ Proto-persona profiles 

■ Journey maps 

■ User story backlog 

Note: ​all ​project documentation has been gathered and shared 
with the HEE team via the project Basecamp 
(​https://3.basecamp.com/3606110/projects/11275496​). 

1.7. Background to this user research 
HEE have ambitious plans to provide a national discovery 
service for NHS staff. The service will provide a single gateway to 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 6 of 40  

https://3.basecamp.com/3606110/projects/11275496


 

trusted sources of information and knowledge, and will be 
developed to meet needs of the majority of potential users. 

However, the national discovery service may not meet the 
needs of more expert searchers who need to carry out complex, 
frequent and repeat searches, for example to support a 
systematic review.  

These expert searchers currently use a range of tools to conduct 
their work, including HDAS which provides a single interface to 
search datasets from multiple providers. 

This research provides evidence about the needs of this group 
of expert searchers to inform decisions about how they might 
be met.  

2. User research 
2.1. Method 

Our researchers consulted with a range of users during the user 
research to explore their context, needs, emotions, and 
behaviours. 

2.1.1. Qualitative research 
■ 12 one-to-one interviews with user representatives  
■ 5 user participants in a user needs workshop 
■ Observed 3 field visits with 3 participants 
■ Reviewed open text comments in 169 online surveys 
■ 3 participants in a diary study 

2.1.2. Quantitative research 

■ 169 respondents to the online user needs survey 

Note: due to time restraints, surveys were online, with links sent 
to email addresses. It is appreciated that this may bring a bias 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 7 of 40  



 

toward users with a higher level of digital literacy. This was 
considered when interpreting the results. 

2.2. User roles 
The user research explored these user roles, identified during 
the inception phase:  

3.2.1. Primary roles 

3.2.1.1. Information and knowledge professionals, including 
librarians 

■ HDAS users 
■ Native interface users 
■ Trainers 
■ Literature searchers 
■ Systematic review searchers 
■ Clinical librarians 
■ Corporate librarians  
■ Subject librarians (academic) 

3.2.1.2. Expert non-librarians, including heavy users of 
discovery tools such as HDAS 

■ Researchers 
■ NHS R&D  
■ Applying for research grants 
■ People writing guidelines/policies  
■ Doing research projects  

■ Individuals  
■ Keep up to date with latest research 
■ Sharing latest research with others 
■ Documenting results 
■ People doing CPD 

■ Masters students 
■ PHD students 
■ Trainers of non-librarians 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 8 of 40  



 

■ Pharmacists 

Note: Some users can cover one or more roles (eg librarians 
who cover both clinical and corporate).  

2.3. Key findings from the user research 
Our findings are organised by 4 broad groups: 

■ Who the expert searchers are:​ who makes up this 
group, and what defines them 

■ Performing expert searches:​ how expert searchers 
behave, why they behave in these ways, and the tools and 
techniques they use 

■ Current satisfaction: ​levels of satisfaction with the tools 
and support available 

■ Unmet needs and current workarounds: ​what expert 
searchers would like be able to do but can’t, or find 
difficult 

2.3.1. Who the expert searchers are 

2.3.1.1. Most expert searchers are librarians 

The user research found that most expert searchers are 
professional librarians.  

This finding supports the evidence from the analysis of “Heavy 
Users” of HDAS carried out by NICE, which found that all but 7 of 
the 250 heaviest users of HDAS are professional librarians. 

Other expert searchers include healthcare practitioners, 
healthcare researchers, Masters and PhD students. And some 
people in other roles, such as Health Technology Analysts, may 
also be expert searchers.  

Non-librarian expert searchers do not seem to develop their 
searching skills organically as part of their professional role. 
Instead, they develop their expert searching skills through 
additional training or postgraduate study.

“We get to be trained specifically in using various 
databases, analysing the resources” ​- Pharmacist, 
interview 

“I didn’t have any such skills until I decided to start with 
my Masters degree”​ - Masters student, Consultant 
Psychiatrist, interview  

“I’ve also done a CLAHRC fellowship, which is this thing 
about transferring research into clinical practice… ...as 
part of the CLAHRC we were given some training in 
searching”​ - Clinical Psychologist, field visit  

“My background is all academic research. So a lot of that 
involved searching, largely PubMed, for sort of scientific 
papers and what have you”​ - Health Technology 
Analyst, interview 

2.3.1.2. Knowing where to look for information is a key 
expert searching skill 

Users reported that knowing where to look for different types of 
information is part of their expert searching skill set.  

This indicates that expert searching skills are not bound to a 
specific tool such as HDAS, but that they can be applied to a 
range of different sources. 

“We just all kind of know which sources we need to 
search for each request as it comes in” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

“Some of my skills are centered around knowing where to 
look for information” ​- Librarian, interview  

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 10 of 40  



 

“It’s a case of trying to kind of expand my knowledge of 
different sources of information and where that would be 
held. It’s tricky because there’s obviously so many 
different places, it’s just a case of taking each search as it 
comes and trying to kind of work out where the best 
places are to look” ​- Librarian, interview 

2.3.1.3. Expert searchers do things that non-expert 
searchers cannot do 

Users suggested that while non-expert searchers are likely to 
carry out quicker searches, expert searchers carry out different 
types of search that are far more thorough. They noted that 
expert searches are more in-depth and exhaustive.  

“They’re probably just looking for something quite quickly 
whereas I think we’re looking for, you know a lot more 
in-depth and finding everything or everything as far as 
you possibly can” ​- Librarian, interview  

“We are very thorough” ​- Pharmacist, interview  

“We wouldn’t just look in one database, we would look in 
several” ​- Librarian, interview 

Users also described using features of search interfaces that 
non-expert searchers would be less likely to make use of. This 
includes using different fields within the search interfaces and 
using the thesaurus to identify additional search terms. 

“Particular fields, tapping into the thesaurus, the 
taxonomy that’s used on each particular database. Being 
able to collate the results I’m getting back” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

During the field visits, users were observed using features such 
as the thesaurus in HDAS, MeSH browsers, and floating 
subheadings. 

2.3.1.4. Expert searchers use their specialist knowledge to 
guide their searching 

Expert searchers may have specialist subject knowledge which 
they use to guide their searching. For example, pharmacists 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 11 of 40  



 

may use their knowledge of specific drugs and clinical 
conditions to assist them in finding relevant information to 
answer questions from requesters. 

“I may not find the drug being used in the clinical 
condition they’re asking me for but if I can think of a 
similar clinical condition and I can find the drug being 
used there, I might extrapolate that data” ​- Pharmacist, 
interview 

The specialist knowledge that expert searchers have around the 
functionality of different search tools and interfaces can also 
guide how they search.  

“Using the various limits and all the additional features on 
the databases but using them to the best advantage… 
...knowing when to use them and knowing when not to 
use them as well”​ - Librarian, interview 

2.3.1.5. Expert searchers carry out a wide range of different 
searches 

The qualitative research found that there is a vast range of 
expert searches. This includes literature searches, searching for 
systematic reviews, and searching to inform patient care.  

Other expert searches include searching for audits and 
corporate searches, as well as searching to inform guidelines 
and policy.  

84% of respondents to our survey said that they carry out 
searches to inform guidelines and policy, while 54% of 
respondents are carrying out searches for systematic reviews. 

2.3.1.5. Expert searchers are running searches for 
themselves and for other people 

Librarians reported that they are mostly searching for 
information for other people. Their searches are typically 
prompted by a request from a library user. For example, a 
librarian may receive an email from a clinic or manager asking 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 12 of 40  



 

for information on a particular topic, or an answer to a specific 
question. 

“Almost all of it is for other people. So, anyone who works 
for the Trust, so any doctors, nurses, management staff” ​- 
Librarian, interview 

“It’ll usually be an email, or a discussion with a library 
user, who has a question that they need answering”​ - 
Librarian, interview 

Some librarians reported that they may carry out additional 
preemptive searches for others. For example, they may carry 
out searches on topics that are being covered in the news if they 
expect that library users will request information on such topics.  

“We do some kind of, what we’d call preemptive 
searching, so we do a bit of that. So if we think there’s 
topics that a lot of staff are asking about or there’s 
something in the news that’s a big topic or a new 
initiative, we would preempt that and produce something 
for all the staff”​ - Librarian, interview 

Some expert searchers run searches for themselves as well as 
for other people. This may apply if an expert searcher has more 
than one role, for example if they are a healthcare practitioner 
and a Masters student. In this case, they may search for 
information relating to patient care and share this with 
colleagues in their role as a healthcare practitioner. On the 
other hand, they may carry out searches for themselves when 
working on their dissertation in their role as a Masters student. 

“Usually, if it is something interesting, of course I share it 
with my colleagues at work in order to find ways together, 
how we’re going to take a case forward… with my 
dissertation it was a personal thing so I didn’t have to 
liaise with anyone” ​- Masters student and Consultant 
Psychiatrist, interview 

While librarians reported that they largely carried out expert 
searches for other people, there was some evidence to suggest 
that on occasion they also carry out searches for themselves.  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 13 of 40  



 

One librarian who took part in the diary study recorded carrying 
out two searches that were not for other people. These 
searches both involved looking for information when planning 
upcoming training sessions with library users. 

2.3.1.6. Some expert searchers train others to run their own 
searches 

Some expert searchers reported that they train students and 
staff to run their own searches.  

These people noted that while part of their role involves using 
their skills to find information for other people, another 
important part of their role is to upskill other people.  

This is not a behaviour that is restricted solely to librarians; 
other expert searchers such as pharmacists also reported 
training other people in using HDAS. 

“It’s kind of using my own skills and also sort of trying to 
upskill everybody else”​ - Librarian, interview 

“I actually provide that training in an IT suite, over 
one-to-one, with a group of people all sitting at a 
computer and going through it” ​- Pharmacist, interview 

2.3.1.7. Some people self-define as expert searchers but do 
not meet the criteria for being expert searchers 

Some users reported that they were expert searchers but their 
search behaviours indicated that they are not.  

These users may have strong information searching skills but 
are not currently carrying out complex or frequent searches and 
are therefore not currently expert searchers.  

These users had no experience of using HDAS, and did not 
search using the native interfaces. They use Google and Google 
Scholar to meet the majority of their searching needs. The 
searches that they are carrying out lack the level of depth and 
thoroughness that is characteristic of expert searches.  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 14 of 40  



 

The needs of this group are likely to be met by the National 
Discovery System or existing platforms such as Google. 

During the kick off session for the project, potential user roles 
for expert searchers were discussed. It was anticipated that 
administrators were unlikely to be expert searchers, and that if 
there were any administrator expert searchers, the numbers for 
this group would be very small. This was confirmed by the fact 
that no administrators came through the initial screening form 
for this research. 

2.3.2. Performing expert searchers 

2.3.2.1. Lots of expert searches are carried out in HDAS 

The qualitative research found that expert searchers are heavy 
users of HDAS. HDAS is often used as a first port of call for 
expert searchers, and many reported that HDAS is their primary 
tool for searching for information.  

“Most of the time I would start with HDAS” ​- Research 
Officer, interview 

“Barely a day goes by when I’m not on the NICE HDAS 
website looking for something” ​- Health Technology 
Analyst, interview 

This was supported by the results of the user needs validation 
survey, in which 86% of respondents reported using HDAS. 
These findings are in line with the HDAS user statistics provided 
by NICE, which indicate that expert searchers are heavy users of 
HDAS. 

2.3.2.2. A key part of some expert searches is planning the 
search itself 

The research found that planning is an important part of some 
expert searches. This involves developing the search strategy 
and identifying appropriate keywords.  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 15 of 40  



 

“I tend to try to come up with a bit of a strategy first, 
before just sort of diving in. So, kind of thinking around 
keywords and thinking of like different synonyms, kind of 
building the sort of structure of the search up” ​- 
Librarian, interview 

Expert searchers may also carry out an exploratory search if 
they receive requests for information in an area that is 
unfamiliar to them.  

As observed in one of the field visits, expert searchers may use 
Google or Wikipedia to quickly look up information on an 
unfamiliar topic, treatment, or clinical condition, and use this 
information to assist with identifying relevant subject headings. 

“Started with exploratory search to assess the number 
and types of publications broadly related to the question 
and to familiarise myself with the specific terminology, 
and gather subject headings and keywords and 
synonyms” ​- Librarian, diary study 

One user indicated that this is to ensure that their searches are 
exhaustive and capture all of the relevant information.  

“As an expert searcher you’ve kind of got to have a little 
more tenacity there and be able to really really expand on 
that and have, you know, all of the possible keywords and 
be completely exhaustive and, you know, think of all the 
international variants” ​- Librarian, interview 

2.3.2.3. Expert searchers are using a wide range of search 
interfaces and information sources 

While lots of expert searches are carried out in HDAS, the 
qualitative research identified a large number of different 
search interfaces and information sources that are used when 
carrying out searches.  

A total of 26 different search tools were mentioned in the diary 
study. Those that were used most frequently across the diary 
study entries include HDAS, PubMed, Google Scholar, and CRD.  

Those who responded to the user needs validation survey are 
using a variety of additional resources. These include Cochrane, 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 16 of 40  



 

Trip, sources of grey literature such as OpenGrey, and specific 
websites such as Royal College websites. 

Some expert searchers have lists of go-to resources outside of 
HDAS and the native interfaces. These lists may be ones that 
users have created themselves as a means of keeping track of 
useful resources. 

“I’ve got a list basically that I kind of add to, lots of 
different sources that I can refer to because obviously 
there are so many, it’s hard to kind of keep track”​ - 
Librarian, interview 

Other expert searchers, such as pharmacists, are provided with 
lists of recommended resources. 

“[UKMI] creates a list of resources that are recommended 
for all the MI services to use”​ - Pharmacist, interview 

2.3.2.4. There are a number of factors that guide decisions 
on which search tools are used 

Some decisions on where a search is carried out are based on 
habit, training, or familiarity with certain tools. 

“I suppose it’s a little bit of habit. A little bit of the way I 
was trained initially when I joined the NHS” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

“HDAS was the first one that I learned, and I [felt] more 
confident with using this”​ - Masters student and 
Consultant Psychiatrist, interview 

Other decisions on which tools are used for searches are guided 
by the question that is being asked. 

“Generally look at the question, or questions, if it’s 
multi-component” ​- Librarian, interview  

A librarian in the diary study noted that they had chosen to 
search in HDAS and Pedro because these databases suited the 
clinical question. 

Some decisions on search tools are guided by what expert 
searchers have access to. 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 17 of 40  



 

“It’s [HDAS] what’s provided through the hospital” ​- 
Health Technology Analyst, interview  

“I use HDAS because I also feel that we ought to use what 
we’ve paid for”​ - Librarian, field visit 

In some cases, expert searches are guided by the information 
requester when choosing search tools and resources. 

“Sometimes they’ll [the requester] make a suggestion” - 
Librarian, interview 

“I think there’s an element of this is what we think our 
users expect”​ - Librarian, interview 

2.3.2.5. Expert searchers use a range of methods to record, 
report, and share the results of their searches 

Methods for recording information include spreadsheets, saving 
search strategies in HDAS, and using reference management 
software. Some expert searchers use templates to record and 
share the results of their searches. 

“We have an in house template that we use. It’s a Word 
document based off one from a different hospital… the 
document is then saved on our shared drive as a PDF and 
is emailed to the user” ​- Librarian, interview 

“We have a template that can be adapted, that would 
include details of who has done it, and what they’re 
asking for, the question they’re asking”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

Some reported other methods of sharing information. These 
methods include writing up search results as reports, sharing 
information at meetings, and sharing specific articles with 
colleagues in person. 

“That [sharing information] would be done, most of the 
time, writing a report at the end”​ - Research Officer, 
interview 

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 18 of 40  



 

“What I might have done is print that article and show it 
to the psychiatrist before the appointment” ​- Clinical 
Psychologist, field visit 

2.3.2.6. Timeframes for expert searches vary with different 
types of search 

Some expert searches take longer to complete than others.  

One librarian in the diary study recorded searches that ranged 
from 30 minutes in length (searching for current awareness) to 
210 minutes (searching to inform patient diagnoses). 

Some searches are carried out over multiple days. 

One librarian in the diary study reported carrying out one 
search (literature search) across 2 days. This was broken down 
into 2 sessions, each lasting for 90 minutes. 

“We think, and this is only a guess, anywhere between 
about 15 and 30 hours of our time [for a systematic 
review search]… it will be broken up, a few hours here, a 
few hours there”​ - Librarian, interview 

The priority that is given to a search may depend on the 
purpose of the search.  

“Urgent patient care, that will get prioritised over 
something that is like a systematic review” ​- Librarian, 
interview  

It was observed during a field visit with a librarian that the 
target timeframe for searches for patient care was much 
shorter (2 working days) than for searches for education, 
teaching, or CPD (4 weeks).

2.3.3. Current satisfaction 

2.3.3.1. Users were generally satisfied that they could find 
the information they need 

Users indicated that overall, they are generally satisfied with the 
tools they have available to them for finding the information 
they need.  

“I think pretty satisfied”​ - Librarian, interview 

“I would say very satisfied, top of the scale”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

Some users are less satisfied. 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 20 of 40  



 

“Partially. We could do with better management stuff” ​- 
Librarian, interview 

“I’m probably dissatisfied with our local IT”​ - Pharmacist, 
interview  

One librarian in the diary study reported IT and network issues 
in 3 out of their 10 diary entries. 

2.3.3.2. Users identified the positive elements of their 
experience with HDAS 

Users feel that HDAS is user friendly, easy to use, and that it has 
a clear interface. 

“I use HDAS because it’s a really nice, clean interface” ​- 
Clinical Psychologist, field visit 

Those who have been using HDAS for longer periods of time 
feel that it has improved since it was first developed. 

“Compared to how it was when it was first being 
developed, it’s [HDAS] so much better”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

Users find it helpful that they are able to easily switch between 
different databases within HDAS without having to use a 
different interface. They also feel that HDAS is useful for 
carrying out thorough searches. 

“HDAS gives you this flexibility of being able to switch 
from one, you know, PubMed or Medline, or join them 
together”​ - Research Officer, interview 

“Being able to sort of combine, you know, do a really 
thorough search” ​- Health Technology Analyst, 
interview 

2.3.3.3. Users identified the positive elements of their 
experience with other search tools 

Users feel that the native interfaces are robust and reliable.  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 21 of 40  



 

“I think generally they’re [native interfaces] a lot more 
robust, they never go down”​ - Librarian, interview 

Users explained that the additional features that are present in 
the native interfaces are helpful for expert searchers. 

“I think they [native interfaces] have a lot of features that 
are really beneficial, things like being able to do more 
complex searches”​ - Librarian, interview 

Specific features in some search tools were singled out as being 
particularly useful. 

“Things like domain searches are useful on Google”​ - 
Librarian, interview 

2.3.3.4. Users identified the pain points in their experience 
with HDAS 

Users described some of the difficulties that they encounter 
when using HDAS. Some of these difficulties relate to accessing 
full text articles through HDAS. 

“Sometimes I can’t get things through our [Trust] HDAS 
subscription. But sometimes you go to PubMed, do the 
same search, and some of the papers you can just get 
through PubMed”​ - Health Technology Analyst, 
interview 

Users also reported problems with running complex searches in 
HDAS. During one of the field visits, a Clinical Psychologist 
explained that it is not possible to use the AND/OR operators in 
HDAS when a user is running a search across multiple 
databases.  

Users suggested that HDAS is therefore not as good as other 
search tools for complex searches. 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 22 of 40  



 

“If you do a sort of more complex search where you 
search for term A, and then term B, C, D, E. If you then 
combine them, using the AND/OR functions, you can’t 
then repeat that search across 3 or 4 other databases, 
you’ve got to go and do each one separately”​ - Health 
Technology Analyst, interview 

“Previously, you used to be able to run a keyword search 
across 5 databases, run another keyword search across 
the same, as long as they were the same 5, you could 
then combine them with the AND operator within the 
search panel. That’s no longer available, you have to 
either search the databases separately or put your entire 
search strategy into a single search line and then just run 
it as a one off, you can’t then add any limits or combine 
any more” ​- Librarian, interview

Some users expressed frustration at the error messages they 
receive in HDAS. Users explained that error messages are 
sometimes unclear, and sometimes appear for no reason.  

“You get errors sometimes and you’re not sure why”​ - 
Librarian, interview 

“Sometimes you’ll do a search in Medline and then try 
and replicate it in EMBASE, and often, you often get lots 
of error messages, for no reason. Often you have to kind 
of click retry and it works that second time” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

One user also noted that sometimes when errors occur in 
HDAS, they do not receive an error message, but instead they 
are alerted to the error as their search returns unexpected 
results. 

“I think in some cases like that it’s not that you’ve got it 
wrong and you get an error message, you just get a 
slightly odd result” ​- Librarian, interview 

Some users are frustrated that HDAS does not cover the most 
recent content. 

“It’s [HDAS] not as up to date as PubMed. It’s not updated 
as regularly so you can do a search in HDAS but then it’s 
obviously not necessarily got the very recent articles, so 
that’s a little bit annoying if somebody wants really up to 
date stuff or just recent information” -​ Librarian, 
interview  

One librarian in the diary study reported searching in PubMed 
as well as HDAS to ensure that they were capturing the most 
recent evidence. 

“Primary sources (articles) search in HDAS Medline and 
Embase was complemented with a search in PubMed to 
ensure the most up-to-date evidence was found”​ - 
Librarian, diary study 

Some users highlighted problems that they experience when 
using the thesaurus in HDAS.  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 24 of 40  



 

“I had problems with searching for the corresponding 
subject headings in HDAS Embase (the search facility 
there is simply inadequate, it would have been much 
better to have access to proper Embase thesaurus 
search)” ​- Librarian, diary study  

“It used to be that you could type in a word, search it in 
the thesaurus, and it would come up with lots of different 
things relevant to that. But now you have to type in the 
exact thesaurus term for it to actually come up, and that’s 
really annoying because usually you don’t necessarily 
know that the thesaurus term is” ​- Librarian, interview 

“When I’m using Medline, I always use that with the 
original MeSH browser from the National Library of 
Health… I found their MeSH browser much much more 
useful than the one from HDAS”​ - Pharmacist, interview 

Some users explained that they use another MeSH browser to 
find their terms before carrying out a search in HDAS. 

“I do go through the process of knowing what my terms 
are before I even get to HDAS, then having to go through 
the whole thesaurus process and having to re-input 
everything… that is a process I’m willing to do” ​- 
Pharmacist, interview  

“I have to go to PubMed, to their MeSH headings in 
PubMed to find out, so it’s like an extra step. I find that 
really frustrating and annoying”​ - Librarian, interview  

Some users explained that they do not feel that HDAS is suitable 
for carrying out searches for systematic reviews. Users 
therefore carry out these searches using other tools such as the 
native interfaces. 

“We end up having to use the native interfaces, because 
HDAS just can’t cope with it” [systematic reviews] ​- 
Librarian, interview 

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 25 of 40  



 

“It [HDAS] doesn’t have the same quality of reproducibility 
as Ovid does. So particularly if they’re publishing, then I 
would do the search on Ovid, it’s worth the extra hassle if 
other people are going to see this” ​- Librarian, interview 

2.3.3.5. Users identified the pain points in their experience 
with other search tools 

Some users indicated that the user guides for the native 
interfaces are not always helpful. 

“If you go to PubMed and you want to find out how to use 
that, the user guide is horrendous, it’s like a completely 
different language”​ - Pharmacist, interview 

“There are some new features being introduced by them 
[native interfaces], which the database providers don’t 
necessarily explain very well”​ - Librarian, interview 

Some users explained that the native interfaces all look different 
from one another, and that they all work in different ways. 

“I really don’t like the EBSCO one… I find that one much 
more complicated to use” ​- Librarian, interview 

“They [native interfaces] all work slightly differently”​ - 
Librarian, interview 

Users need to learn how to use each individual native interface. 
For expert searchers who are heavy users of HDAS, running 
searches in the native interfaces can take longer because they 
are less familiar with them. 

“For me there’s always a little bit of a kind of a learning 
curve of oh right where’s the box to put the search terms 
in and oh it’s over here and how do I combine this and so 
on” ​- Librarian, interview 

“You have to know how to use them and we don’t receive 
training. Well, I’ve never received training in it, I’ve only 
ever learned how to use them through my own time and 
effort” ​- Librarian, interview  

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 26 of 40  



 

“It’s annoying that I have to do it separately [search 
Health Business Elite], I can’t just search it as part of 
HDAS… ...it would be less time consuming and not having 
to kind of learning how to use a different type of 
interface, with different ways of truncation and things like 
that”​ - Librarian, interview 

Some users highlighted problems with re-running searches and 
managing duplicates when working across different search 
tools. 

“Lack of ability to re-run things… ...I’d have to just look at 
my search strategy and type it all out again” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

“Making sure there's no duplicate entries, is always very 
time consuming” ​- Librarian, interview 

Some users reported that it takes extra time to compile the 
results of a search when they have searched in different places. 

”There isn't an easy way to export and import the search 
results in KnowledgeShare… ...time consuming for even 
relatively small amount of results!” ​- Librarian, diary 
study 

“I need an easier way to compile search results from 
multiple resources as I don't have access to reference 
manager software” ​- Other library and information 
professional, user needs validation survey 

2.3.3.6. Some users felt their needs would be met by other 
search tools if they were unable to use HDAS 

Users who are heavy users of HDAS were asked how they would 
run searches if they were unable to use HDAS. Some users felt 
that their needs would be met by other services. 

“If HDAS went down I would use PubMed for my Medline 
access” ​- Pharmacist, interview 

“Just a standard PubMed search” [if I couldn’t use HDAS]​ - 
Health Technology Analyst, interview 

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 27 of 40  



 

“I would go directly again to PubMed or Medline”​ - 
Research Officer, interview 

“We do have access to the native interfaces here as well, 
we’ve got access to Medline, and EMBASE through Ovid 
so yeah, we’ve got kind of a fallback”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

“If push came to shove, that’s [native interfaces] all you 
really need for advanced searching”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

Some users had concerns about specific needs not being met by 
other search tools.  

“If HDAS went down, I have no Embase” ​- Pharmacist, 
interview 

“I would need to go into Ovid, and search Medline via 
Ovid. Which is fine but not ideal… because I’ve not been 
using it, it’s easily forgotten”​ - Librarian, interview 

2.3.4. Unmet needs and current workarounds 

2.3.4.1. Some users expressed that they are not always able 
to access everything that they need 

Users reported that they have unmet needs around access to 
resources. Some users feel that they do not have access to 
sources of information on specific topics such as management. 

“Management and quality improvement type stuff, you 
know we just don’t have access to enough of those 
resources” ​- Librarian, interview  

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 28 of 40  



 

“I’m not thinking that there’s millions of things that we’re 
missing out on, but I think it would just be nice, it would 
just be more reassuring, to know that if there was 
anything broader, that we had that slightly broader range 
of coverage and could search. Things like management, 
and HR, social care, research methodologies… 
...technology, IT, informatics literature… ...healthcare 
economics”​ - Librarian, interview  

“It would be useful to have direct access to different 
journals” ​- Research Officer, interview  

“[Sometimes] we haven’t got access to something that we 
might be able to look at that would help us find 
something useful” ​- Librarian, interview 

Other users expressed a desire for easier to use help functions 
and help content written specifically for expert searchers. 

“Easier to use help function… it would be nice if you could 
divide it up [help content] for your simple user versus 
your advanced user”​ - Pharmacist, interview  

“Please consider that we also have to teach others to 
search, so decent help materials are key”​ - Librarian, 
user needs validation survey 

Some users described workarounds that they use when they 
have problems with accessing information. 

“For some of them [articles] I was just getting the abstract 
and some keywords… I had to go to the online library 
system of the University of Plymouth… I had to look for 
them there” ​- Masters student and Consultant 
Psychiatrist, interview 

“If we don’t have access to any particular journal… I can 
always just ask and somebody somewhere might have 
access to it” ​- Librarian, interview 

2.3.4.2. Some users suggested that additional filters and 
limits would be helpful  

Some users reported that it would be useful to have additional 
filters and limits when carrying out expert searches.  

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 29 of 40  



 

“If there’s any kind of filters for themes, or years… that 
can be useful”​ - Librarian, interview 

“Largely we just get English language coming back but you 
might want to put those sorts of limitations on”​ - Health 
Technology Analyst, interview 

2.3.4.3. Some users would like to be able to search for 
non-clinical information in one place 

Users noted that they currently have to use different resources 
to access non-clinical information and grey literature. They 
expressed a desire to be able to search for this type of 
information within a single interface. 

“If there was somewhere, one place that could have that 
kind of NHS management information… …that would 
make my life a huge amount easier because I wouldn’t be 
trawling through lots of different websites”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

“A better database of guidelines, international and 
national guidelines, would be really useful” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

2.3.4.3. Some users suggested that it would be helpful to 
have citation searching features within the search interface 

Some users noted that it would be useful to have citation 
searching or related article searching features within the search 
interface.  

“It would be quite good if HDAS could do something like 
that, an in built kind of citation matching tool” - ​Librarian, 
interview 

In the user needs validation survey, one participant (other 
library and information professional) indicated that a “find 
similar article function” would be useful. 

Existing citation matching tools or related article search 
functions were viewed positively. 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 30 of 40  



 

“I love the single citation matcher” [in PubMed] ​- 
Librarian, field visit  

“You can do like a related article search on Mendeley and 
that’s deal useful, especially if somebody sends you a 
paper and says I want things like this”​ - Librarian, 
interview 

2.3.4.4. Some users would like to be able to share live 
searches with others. 

Some users explained that when working collaboratively on a 
search with other team members, it would be helpful to be able 
to share live searches and work on searches in the same 
interface. 

“If she [colleague] could ping me over the live search, and 
I would then be able to go through it, that would be 
useful”​ - Health Technology Analyst, interview 

“It’s easier if you’ve got a team of you working on 
something if you’re using the same interface” ​- Librarian, 
interview 

When tested in the user needs validation survey, there was a 
medium level of overall need for sharing live searches with 
others inside the NHS. There was a low level of overall need for 
sharing live searches with others inside the NHS.  

However, one participant in the user needs validation survey felt 
strongly that this would be useful for them. This suggests that 
while the overall level of need for such a feature is low or 
medium, a small number of users may have a high level of need 
for this. 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 31 of 40  



 

“The sharing of live searches would be a game changer so 
I am glad to see it has been raised here. I have asked 
again and again whether this would be possible. When we 
run searches for clinicians we could work far more closely 
while developing search strategies and for the clinicians 
who like to attempt their own searching, they can run it 
by us for a library perspective. Please, please prioritise 
the sharing live searches.” ​- Librarian and Masters 
student, user needs validation survey 

One user described a workaround that they and a colleague use 
when working on searches together. 

“If [colleague] does a search for me, she can’t share that 
search directly with me, she has to output it as a PDF or 
Excel”​ - Health Technology Analyst, interview 

2.4. Validating the user needs 
Survey respondents were invited to validate a list of 22 user 
needs identified from the user interviews, field visits, diary 
studies and a user needs workshop. 

Full data is in the User needs validation survey.  

169​ users​ completed the user needs validation survey: 

■ 101 librarians  

■ Clinical, corporate, embedded or outreach librarian 

■ Other library and information professional 

■ Academic librarian 

■ 48 healthcare professionals 

■ E.g. Clinical Psychologist, Consultant Psychiatrist, 
Pharmacist 

■ 15 PhD and Masters students 

■ 11 Healthcare Researchers 

Some users who completed the survey had more than one role.   

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 32 of 40  



 

2.4.1. Analysis method and outputs 

22 user needs were scored by users on a range from ​0 - I have 
no need ​to ​4 - I definitely need​ to… 

(Example) …​be alerted when new features are added to search 
interfaces so I can understand how these features work 

Each need was then categorised into ​Very high​, ​High​, ​Medium 
and ​Low​ priority user needs​ depending on the average score 
of the responses. 

Key: ​yellow = Low need​, ​orange = Medium need​, ​red = High 
need​, ​purple = Very high need 

The levels of user need are shown in the table below.  

 

 

Expert searchers user research   Page 33 of 40  



 

The level of response to the user needs validation survey was 
very good. 

However the overall response in terms of numbers of users 
from the PhD and Masters students and the healthcare 
researchers was low. These users appear to be a small group 
within an already relatively small group of expert searchers. 

The overall need of a service is high 

From our experience of running similar user research in the 
public sector (including online, paper, data, information, 
voluntary and mandatory services within and outside health) 
the general level of user need identified during this research is 
higher than average. 

Lower need around sharing live searches 

When users were asked about the need to share live searches 
so they can easily collaborate on searches with other people 
within or outside of the NHS, the overall level of need came 
back as low/medium.  

However, although there was a low/medium level of need 
overall, some users did report a very high level of need to 
collaborate on live searches.  

2.5. Prioritising the user story backlog 
The evidence from this survey and other user research was 
used by the Health Education England team to directly inform 
their initial round of ​user story prioritisation​ (see output 9: 
Users stories backlog).

3. Journey and experience 
mapping 

During the user research we mapped out 3 expert search 
journeys: 

1) Librarian working on a systematic review 

2) Healthcare researcher developing a research grant 
application 

3) PhD student working on a literature review 

The evidence gathered through this process was used to inform 
the research findings. 

In particular, these journey maps show that there are several 
different stages involved in these types of expert searches. As 
shown in the maps, there are a number of additional roles that 
may be involved in these searches, including library users, 
academic supervisors, and clinicians.  

The maps highlight that a wide range of different tools are used 
in each of these different searches, including search interfaces, 
reference management software, and data analysis software.  

The maps also reveal current pain points for expert searchers in 
each journey. 

PDFs of each of the journey maps are available as an output of 
the research.
