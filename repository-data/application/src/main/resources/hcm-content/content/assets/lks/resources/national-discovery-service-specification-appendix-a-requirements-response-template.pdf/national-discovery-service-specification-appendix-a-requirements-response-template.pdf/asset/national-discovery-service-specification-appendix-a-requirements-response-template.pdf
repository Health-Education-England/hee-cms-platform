6% NHS specific requirements  
 

2% 4. We require a solution tailored to the needs of the NHS and wider healthcare workforce in England  
Describe how your solution will be tailored to meet the needs of the healthcare workforce in England, in terms of the types and 
breadth of resources covered, highlighting  UK-specific sources, the indexing and retrieval of health and care knowledge 
resources, and any other features which may particularly support the requirements of this large, diverse and mobile workforce. 
In particular we require functionality that will suit both infrequent (‘novice’) searchers who require intutive searching such as 
that offered by Google AND advanced searchers who need to carry out structured, patient-focused searches of the research 
literature.

2% 5. We require a solution that will work effectively with our NHS OpenAthens Org ID structure and minimise login requirements  
Describe how your solution will work with our current Org structure.   
 

Confirm that your solution will handle access entitlements such that: 
o Ungated and open access content is available to all users without the need to login 
o Nationally purchased content can be cascaded to all orgs. 
o Consortia purchased content can be cascaded to all orgs in a consortium (e.g. a regional purchasing consortium or a mental 

health purchasing consortium) 
o Locally purchased content can be managed and cascaded to one or more single orgs.   
 

Please clarify whether you envisage a separate ‘instance’ of the discovery service for each Org. 
 
OpenAthens Orgs change (e.g. due to reconfiguration of NHS trusts), our access and identity management system will need to 
be re-procured in 2022, and we will continue to seek ways to reduce complexity and simplify access. Please comment on the 
flexibility of your solution to support these changes.

We want healthcare staff across the country have a similar, familiar, high-quality experience of using the discovery service, 
wherever they work and as they move between organisations, albeit that the content they can access will vary. However, some 
NHS Trusts will wish to add localisation elements (e.g. Trust branding, signposting to bespoke local services). How will you help 
us achieve both these requirements?

Please complete Appendix C and comment here on the extent to which the solution offered will ensure that users 
can find relevant results from across all types of content available to the healthcare workforce, including high quality 
free-to-use resources, and content in local repositories, as well as content purchased from third party suppliers.  Are 
there any healthcare publishers whose content cannot currently be surfaced via your solution? Is the knowledge 
base automatically updated from external sources such as other link resolvers (e.g. the KB+ 56 and GoKB7 services) 
and collection updates from publishers?

E-books are currently purchased and managed in different ways, at national, regional and local level, in different formats. Title 
records may be included in LMSs and/or collections may be added to local discovery systems where these have been

possible via your solution. Please also confirm how your solution enables access to open access articles within hybrid journal 
titles.

2% 17. We require a delivery partner who can work to our high-level implementation plan 
See Appendix B for the high-level plan.  An essential requirement is implementation of the discovery service, including all 
resources in Appendix C identified as ‘essential for phase 1’ and transfer of all the holdings on the current national link resolver 
and knowledge base by the end of July 2021, to allow a period of parallel running of both systems before the current LRKB 
expires at the end of September 2021. Please see Appendix F for our assumptions about transfer of holdings data.  We also 
require integration with one regional library management system during phase 1. Please see Appendix F for our assumptions 
about integration with a library management system.  Over the two subsequent development phases, we need to see as many 
additional NHS-funded and curated resources as possible discoverable via the service, and integration with further regional 
library management systems, to attract as many users as possible and fully realise the full benefits of this service for the 
workforce in England. 
 
Please describe how you will work with HEE, NICE, the current LRKB supplier, LMS suppliers and library service staff to meet or 
exceed our requirements and ambition.

administration, and end-user support, at national, regional and local level.  Describe how users will be supported to make the 
best use of the service. Please see Appendix F for our assumptions about staff and user training.

1% 20. We are seeking a solution that will provide an A-Z journals listing and the basis of a ‘union list of journals’  
An A-Z journals titles list is currently provided (https://journals.nice.org.uk/) to enable users to see the journals available to 
them whether licenced nationally, regionally or locally, and whether print or electronic.  Describe whether and how the solution 
will enable us to continue to offer this service.  

 

We would also like the LRKB to provide the basis for a national ‘union list of journals’ as a single place for library staff to search 
for print and e-journals held locally elsewhere to request copies under the CLA Licence on behalf of their service users. The list 
would need to be interrogated using commonly used protocols by regional library management and interlibrary document 
supply systems. Please comment on the extent to which your solution could help us deliver this ambition.

response and escalation processes and availability hours of supplier support staff for critical issues (loss of access, loss of 
functionality, resource access issues, authentication issues, security breach)? How can more minor issues be escalated if needs 
are not being met?
