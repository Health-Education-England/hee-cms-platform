1 Cannot access the 
website: ‘page cannot 
be displayed’ or 
similar 

1. Internet down  Check other websites to see if it is a wider issue with your internet connection. 
If all websites are affected, contact your local IT department.

2. Specific service(s) 
down 

Check email lists such as Core Content, NICE service information page, OpenAthens 
service page or Ovid’s Link Resolver service status page to see if any problems have 
been reported or there are known issues with specific services. 
 
The Journals A-Z website is down. The A-Z list is produced by NICE and therefore this 
problem should be reported to NICE by the customer (see Appendix for useful 
contacts).

3. Website blocked 
by your 
organisation 

Ask your IT department to check if the website is blocked locally.  
See also a list of websites that should not be blocked 
 
In a small number of cases, firewalls block access on the basis of IP address as well as 
URL. In this case, changes in supplier/publishers’ IP addresses should be forwarded to 
the local IT Department.

2 Resource will not 
authenticate saying 
‘you do not have 
rights to access the 
material’ or similar 

This resource has not 
been activated for 
your OpenAthens 
org ID 

This message is usually generated when a supplier has not enabled Openathens 
access to the resource for your organisation. There may be a number of reasons for 
this but normally it is because your subscription has lapsed or your subscript ion has 
not been set up correctly.  If you are sure that you should have access rights to this 
material and / or have placed the order for the resource contact the 
supplier/publisher to activate your access. They will need details of your OpenAthens 
org ID. A list of OpenAthens org IDs with names is available.

3 Resource 
authenticates to 
another NHS 
organisation name 

Supplier/publisher is 
using IP 
authentication 
rather than 
OpenAthens 
 

Check to make sure that the resource is not one of the national collections made 
available using IP authentication.   If it is, contact the publisher/supplier direct to 
query your access. 
Where the resource is not designed to be IP authenticated, contact the 
supplier/publisher to switch off IP authentication and ensure that OpenAthens access 
is enabled.

Note: the use of IP authentication in the NHS below NHS England level can be 
problematic. However, some NHS organisations do employ IP authentication. It is 
possible to obtain a fixed IP address. Check with your local IT department to see if this 
possible. 
Note: IP authentication does not work for off-site access unless EZProxy has been 
implemented.   

4 Unexpected 
functionality or 
message about 
browser support 

Browser issues or 
browser plug-in 
issues 

Most supplier/publishers no longer support older versions of IE and sometimes not 
even IE at all. Check with the supplier/publisher. 
Ask the IT department to upgrade your browser or browser plug -ins, or give you 
access to alternative browsers such as Firefox and / or Chrome.

5 The A-Z is displaying 
data incorrectly, eg 
issues such as HTML 
tags displaying on the 
page.   

 While NICE produce the A-Z list, they populate the website with data taken from 
Wolters Kluwer.  Therefore, initially we should log this job with Wolters Kluwer.

Search results say that 
the resource cannot 
be accessed  

Content is selected 
on the link resolver 
but shouldn’t be, or 
the supplier hasn’t 
activated the 
resource correctly 
for you  

Check your subscription.   
If you are entitled to this content, ask the publisher to check that they have activated 
it. 
If you aren’t entitled to this content, then ask the local link resolver administrator to 
deselect the relevant collection / title(s).

WAYFless, i.e. further

1. Wrong collection 
has been 
selected on ODS 

Contact Wolters Kluwer for additional advice on the appropriate WAYFless collection.  Wolters Kluwer 

2. WAYFless URLs 
are not 
supported by the 
supplier/ 
publisher 

Not all supplier/publishers support WAYFless linking and so users are necessarily 
required to select NHS England as their organisation before going through to the 
article. 
Check with the supplier/publisher to see if WAYFless linking is supported. There is a 
list of service providers with WAYFless URLs  
 
Where WAYFless is not supported, consider adding a collection-level note against the 
collection to assist users to navigate to the full text

11 The holding details are 
wrong on the A-Z list 
and/or HDAS 

 If it is a nationally-shared collection, contact NICE for investigation and resolution.  
 
If it is purchased locally and is part of a package, managed as part of a single 
collection, contact Wolters Kluwer. 
 
If it is a journal added by a local administrator, then ask the local administrator to 
correct the holdings.

12 The holding details are 
correct but the link(s) 
in the A-Z list and/or 
HDAS are not working.   
 

 This is likely to be a problem with Link Resolver and the job should be logged with 
Wolters Kluwer support 
• Typical problems occur when there is an ampersand in the title: e.g. Diabetes & 

Diet (not a real journal name). 
• The journal issue is a supplement. 
Warning. Problems may also occur when the publisher is slow to upload a journal to 
their website.  This is most likely to occur in aggregators such as ProQuest and EBSCO. 
This is not a problem with the link resolver and the customer should report the 
problem with the publisher/aggregator (see Appendix B for useful contacts).

13 Link Resolver is being 
very slow.  
 

This is perhaps the 
most difficult 
problem to diagnose 
as the problem may 
be with Link 
Resolver, 
OpenAthens, 
publisher/ 
aggregator, or a local 
issue.   
 

Is the problem with one particular publisher? If so, check to see if you can determine 
any issues with the publisher’s website.  If so, then the problem is more likely to be 
with the publisher and so ask the customer to report the problem with the publisher. 
If no, then log the job with Wolters Kluwer’s help desk 
 
If there is a problem across multiple publishers then try to establish if there are any 
current issues with OpenAthens.  If so, the problem could be with OpenAthens and 
not Link Resolver 
There seems to be no issue with the publisher or OpenAthens, then log a job with 
Wolters Kluwer’s NHS Support 
 
If you are unable to replicate the problem, try to see if anyone else is experiencing 
similar problems.   
If yes, then go back to the beginning, checking publisher/OA, etc.   
If no, then the problem may be a local issue. Ask the customer to contact their IT 
department.
