Is the local admin asking a general question about 

link resolver (e.g. how to add a journal, how to 

add notes visible to end users, etc.)? 

Yes 
• Check Wolters Kluwer’s Link Resolver Help website to see if this question has 

already been answered.  If so, refer the local admin to the relevant section.  

• If you are unable to answer the question yourself and there seems to be no 
answer on the “Knowledge Base” then log the question with Wolters Kluwer. 

No 

Is the local admin reporting a problem with Link 

Resolver (e.g. broken links, etc.)? 

Do you have enough information to start to 

identify the problem?  

 

Yes 

Using the information you gathered together, try 

to replicate the problem. 

See also separate document listing common 

issues and suggested next steps. 

Contact the local admin and ask for further details. It is difficult to be precise as to 

what sort of information you should ask for but here are a few suggestions: 

• Are the links not working in HDAS and/or NICE’s Journals A-Z list? 

• Is the problem limited to a particular publisher or is it affecting multiple 

publishers? 

• Ask for specific examples, e.g. the references for the broken link, screen shots 

• Ask for a test OpenAthens account 

• Ask for a screenshot of their Proxy setup in Link Resolver admin area.  

No
