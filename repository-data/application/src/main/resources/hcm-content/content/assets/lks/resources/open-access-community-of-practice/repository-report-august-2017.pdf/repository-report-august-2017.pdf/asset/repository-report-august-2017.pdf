Institutional Repository Survey Analysis 

 

Introduction 
 

This document records the results of a survey of repository use and provision by LKS 

providing services to the NHS.  Services with and without repositories were invited to 

respond, with those not having a repository in place being asked to comment on whether 

they had explored options in the past. 

 

The survey was undertaken online using the BOS survey tool and took place between 31
st

 

May and 4
th

 July 2017 

 

Definition of a repository 
 

Colleagues identified a lack of consistency in the profession around what was recognised as 

a repository.  In our project we used the following very broad definition which was provided 

at the start of the survey. 
 

Repositories capture, share, utilise and enable access to the knowledge output of the 

NHS organisation served. This can include tacit knowledge such as lessons learned as 

well as poster presentations, publications and documented evidence/knowledge. 
 

In this definition we included listings of publications regardless of whether links were 

provided to internally or externally sourced full text. 

 

Response Rate and Observations 
 

102 responses of which 4 were identified, following investigation, as duplicates and deleted. 

98 unique responses from 95 institutions (some institutions made multiple submissions) 

92 of the 95 institutions are NHS funded LKS making this a 43% response rate based on 

figures quoted in KfH 

 

Points to note 

 Several non-responding Trusts which are known to have repositories were chased 

but did not all respond to the survey 
 

 Some responding institutions are reporting the same shared repository tool 
 

 4 institutions indicated that they did not have an institutional repository but then 

described systems which are covered by our definition of a repository (see above). 

They are therefore treated as having a repository in these results. 
 

 All but one of the responses indicating the presence of an institutional repository 

indicated the involvement of the LKS in the process.

34 of 95 responses (36%) indicated instances of repositories in use within an organisation 

(inc. shared)  

11 of these LKS were situated within Medical Education/Education = 32% of the 34 

7 of these LKS were situated within Medical Directorate = 21% of the 34                                                                 

 

28 of these (82%) repositories included research papers and/or abstracts in the content of 

the repositories  

24 respondents

 Four services indicated they did not have a repository in the survey but then described having one and the 

noted contents of this.  They have been included in some analyses where possible but excluded from some 
analyses to avoid skewing the figures where they were not asked to provide answers to some of the questions.

Recommendations 

We asked respondents with repositories whether they would recommend the system to 

others.   

10 respondents stated yes they would recommend  

5 stated no 

11 did not provide a categoric yes/no response 

 

A total of 25 provided a rationale and further comments about the systems  

 

System in use Recommend 
Yes/No 

Comments 

Drupal Yes It is a good system created 5 years ago in PCT 

DSpace  

It is a good 'budget' software, although I personally think it is 
looking a little dated now, there are some upgrades due. The 
software was initially hosted by BioMed Central but they 
then got bought out by Atmire. I've seen some cleaner 
looking repository software (e.g. KnowledgeArc used by 
@ORDA) and think OR Lite looks a bit tired in comparison, 
but I'm assured that upgrades are coming in the Autumn. 
We only have 1 year of our deal remaining, and we're in 
initial discussions with local HEI re: possibly piggybacking on 
their software in the future. 

D-Space  Yes 
This is a much cheaper solution to other companies out 
their.  

DSpace Yes fairly easy to use 

DSpace  Yes 
DSpace - yes it works and through KnowledgeArc was cheap. 
One other organisation has already subscribed. 

D Space 
Open Repository Yes  

it is very easy to use. Uses a well-regarded platform (D-
Space) and the technical support is very responsive. 

Easysite (Intranet)  
It works at a basic level but we've only recently started so 
it's difficult to say longer term if it will work. 

Easysite Intranet   Yes 
Making information easily discoverable and shareable 
among a clinical population on 2 sites 20 miles apart. 

E-Prints  
It is a very good way to promote the work of our Trust and 
raise its profile. 

Eprints  

For Trusts which are connected to a university this is a good 
option for creating a repository as it does not pose any 
additional costs. eprints is an established system which is fit 
for purpose. 

EPrints /   Yes 
If you have time and money.  A national NHS repository 
would make much more sense. 

Heritage LMS Yes  easy to use and easy storage of information central 

Heritage LMS  

To some extent - it has helped to improve access to 
resources, but as it is only used for Trustwide documents, 
local guidelines are on the intranet. This causes confusion 
for some staff as there are multiple places to look. This is not

14

th
 August 2017 

a problem with the system per se, more to do with how 
things have been set up. One benefit is that we already have 
the system, so no additional costs incurred. 

Heritage LMS  
Easy to set up on existing software.  No extra cost as 
software is used for other resources. 

KOHA   

Koha was purchased initially by the LKS to manage 
guidelines and policies. We now have a second installation 
as of October 2016 which acts as our LMS. It replaced 
Heritage. Small savings were made using one system as 
opposed two and it's easier for staff. The solution works for 
us. Downloads of guidelines and policies for the period 
December 2016-May 2017 - 84,894 We also have a good 
working relationship with PTFS Europe. 

Liberty Library 
Management System Yes 

It has no additional costs, further justifies LMS maintenance 
charge and contributes to widening awareness of staff 
specialties. Staff can come across staff papers at the same 
time as searching for books on the same topic. This helps 
connect people to people. 

MS Access  

I would only recommend it if they wanted a simple, low cost 
option.  It would be possible to achieve something more 
sophisticated with specialist software. 

MS Excel & Refworks  No  

MS Excel  No  
There are better systems out there but we are working with 
what we have as there is no additional charge to us. 

Pure (KCL)  

No idea -  I am far away from managing this system.  Worth 
noting that PURE has been purchased by Elsevier since we 
started using it 

PURE (KCL) No 

Our HE/NHS partnership does not serve the information 
management needs of the Trust so no, I wouldn't 
recommend it. 

SharePoint  No  

SharePoint is not a 'value for money' option and there are 
simpler and cheaper options to deliver a near identical user 
experience (such as using the library LMS, or various cloud 
based applications) 

SharePoint  Yes  Especially if your organisation already has SharePoint 

SharePoint.  No 

Not as it stands at the moment. It's too 'clunky' and isn't 
used as much as it could be. We're looking at a more 
sophisticated system using the newer version of SharePoint. 

Trust intranet  
System is simple but works. Sorting would be useful, but this 
is not possible in the current format. 

Zotero   

I would if you need a publications database at Zero cost, 
with a web interface.  When we reach a critical mass we will 
upscale to Biomed Central or another commercially hosted 
system.

Other Notes 

Respondents were invited to share any further details relating to their experience of 

institutional repositories. 

19 responses were received as follows: 

Key features should include :    
 
1. an automated update feature to allow authors of documents such as 

policies/guidelines/SOP/patient leaflets to be notified that a document is due review after X 
years/months. Keeping the material current is essential.     
 

2. An effective search interface and ability to 'meta-tag' documents to make discovery simple for the 
end-user.     
 

The R&D department have a different repository but they are not sharing currently. We had problems 
with our Comms team as they said they would have to see everything that was loaded in case they 
didn't want it publicised, even if it was in the public domain. We have chosed to go quietly ahead....  
I'm disappointed that we're not working more closely with R&D but they seem to want different 
things. 
 

This was a great idea in the NHS, but has not been fully supported in Local Authority - but have lacked 
the confidence to bin it off. Don't work with LA's in terms of sharing and creating knowledge! 
 

The staff papers are a relatively quick win as automated author affiliation searches can be created in 
HDAS and these can then be cited in the LMS. I am hoping of the majority can be linked out to 
PubMed this will provide maintained links to open access and link out to publishers for further details. 
Making abstracts of papers unnecessary. However I am aware some publication staff publish in are 
not on PubMed. 
 

We share the repository …    The plan is for it to be a county- wide repository.     The next step is to get 
another local Trust on board.     
 

Managing the Trust Clinical Guidelines and Policies has raised the profile of the LKS at Executive level. 
During the 18 months I've been in post I've attended Management Executive on two occasions to 
discuss developments around KOHA.     Gaining the support of the Executive enabled the guidelines 
and policies to be made accessible externally, at the time it was a significant decision.  
 

it is not an "institutional" repository; it is a library maintained collection  the web page stats indicate 
poor usage 
 

A national or even regional repository makes ALLOT more sense than each Trust trying to do this. A 
change to contracts, similar to HE, where someone employed or funded by the NHS must make their 
research and publications available in a national NHS repository makes complete sense. If universities 
can do it, so can the NHS. It could save thousands in ILLs alone. 
 

We have lots of joint NHS academic posts and their outputs are represented in the repository.  We 
only include things that are research related really so would not start holding all sorts of things as per 
your list of potential items.  There is reluctance to add NHS staff less closely connected to us as it 
increases the cost of the licence for a small number of additional publications and the general

aggravation involved.     
 

I would be interested in finding out more about other types of repository in use and the pros and cons 
of each. 
 

Barriers include; finding a suitable time to get everybody who needs to be involved together to discuss 
and agree what is required, obtaining resource to actually build and maintain the repository. 
 

There are a lot of trusts which have already gone down this path or are thinking about it. Its a shame 
that we have all done this individually recreating the wheel when a lot of this information could have 
been shared. I learnt a lot about this from the presentations and workshops at Scarborough’s  HLG 
conference, but a central point for information would have saved time and de-duplication of effort. 
 

You can read more about it here http://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KM-
Toolkit-Model-CreatinganInnovationsDatabaseRBHT.pdf  
 

I worked in Open Access in a HE environment before I came over to the NHS. It seems like the NHS is 
about 5 years behind HE and we can learn a lot from them. It is hard to get the appropriate versions of 
articles from authors - especially as repository deposit isn't mandated like it is in HE. However, I think 
this is a growing area, and one that LKS staff have the ideal skillset for. 
 

The biggest barrier we face is encouraging Trust staff to make full text deposits. We advocate the 
advantages, including increasing impact of their research, timely dissemination of research findings, 
potential increase in citations, making research findings publicly accessible, etc. but as there is no 
mandate from the organisation or other bodies to deposit in an institutional repository the incentive is 
still not there and despite a lot of promotion we have had few deposits. 
 

There is chasing up to do - and looking at likely journals and e-newsletters.... 
 

As this project is in its infancy, hope eventually to have online submission forms so the repository is 
more up to date and can be exported into the records.    The repositories may be a method of showing 
the public how staff are involved in research.    Maybe one day the NHS libraries may have a national 
one with all the publications for researchers to search so people can see what other hospitals are 
doing in their subject are. 
 

Obtaining full text is difficult.    Some of the language relating to open access is not very accessible eg 
final authored versions etc.  We link from our repository to articles and e-books in our library 
collection through a password system when publications are not freely available  We have a statistics 
package linked to our repository which shows where around the world articles are downloaded which 
is always interesting to see.  Anyone setting up a repository needs to factor in marketing costs and 
promotion through Social Media.  We revamped our website a couple of years ago to reflect the 
branding of our Trust. 
 

I copied the system from Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust as they have the same website 
supplier (Easysite CMS).

Organisations with no repository 

48 Organisations responded that they have no repository.  Fourteen (29% of those) have explored 

setting up a repository.  

The most common reasons for not having a repository were staff capacity, cost, it was not a business 

priority or they had not been asked to set one up.  

 

 

The libraries who had explored a repository had investigated a variety of systems.  Two were 

specifically mentioned – this included  

System Reason not implemented 

Koha Technical issues – IT unable to implement 
Apache Open Source software 

Moodle Capacity and the need to identify “champions” 
within the Trust  

 

Six of the 34 libraries who had not explored a repository expressed an interest in finding out more.  

Several libraries commented that this should be a regional/national initiative. 

In summary, most libraries were open to the suggestion of a repository but were unable to take it 

further due to staffing and costing implications.

Comments why they had not explored a repository. 

No time. Not enough staff. 

I wasn't sure how to go about it or what material would be relevant 

The Library has undergone a lot of changes and there has not been time to explore this option. 

Lack of resources i.e. funding and staffing levels    Tried to set up a repository within organisation a 
few months ago. No interest shown at Nursing management level. 
 
We currently use Soutron LMS. I believe they could facilitate a repository module or something of 
similar characteristics. I will be looking into this in the future. 

Never been asked to be involved. 

Don't have funds to support this and don't have evidence of the requirement within the 
organization.  I feel this should be done at a regional or national level.   

Lack of staff time 

I am new in post, so not sure if and if not why not. 

It is a battle to get people to do research and publish in the first place. Should more publications be 
produced, then a repository may be required. 
Are they actually needed? Is this not creating another information silo? 

Currently not trust priority 
We are interested in setting this up , staff time permitting 

Organisational restructuring   Done by someone else - University, but could be doing one for 
Academic health science centre together collaboratively that covers both NHS staff and clinical 
researchers  Staff turnover and loss of posts - lack of stable work environment  I 

I am not aware of the organisation having explored a repository in the past, but if it did, the Library 
was not involved.   The main reason for the Library not being able to explore this ourselves is 
staffing capacity, as we have fewer than 2 WTE staff.  
I am aware of various partial repositories in the organisation, eg the Intranet "Document Library" 
for policies, local guidelines etc(unfortunately we haven't had input into the structure of this), and 
documents from Schwartz Rounds. 
 

Never been asked and when asked if anyone thought there was need received negative response 

I think it would be a good idea but at the moment the Library Team lacks the capacity 

Has not been requested so far, understaffed, lack of time to deal with work involved in such a large 
Trust. I am not aware of any work on tis but cannot say for definite. 

Lack of LKS staff (long term vacant post)  May explore in future 

Knowledge of staff and time pressures. 

Low on priorities, focus on delivering and improving current offerings 
Please share any learnings and findings from this survey with us!  Thanks! 

As a library service, we have never been asked.  I wouldn't know how to go about it. 

Appropriate links weren't in place. 
We are beginning to explore LKS involvement in developing a repository by quality improvement 
projects, audits, junior doctor quality improvement projects & any other projects we can trace 
within the Trust. 

I have never been asked to do so. As far as I know no repository exists within the trust. 

Expense 

It is something we are considering currently but have not explored in detail 

Please note - I'm not sure what may have been explored elsewhere in the Trust.    For me - no 
specific reasons, just not got that far yet.  It's something we would be interested in. 

I am the Operations Library Manager for the trust. We are currently seeking to appoint a Head of 
Service. This an area that would be pursued by that post once it is filled

th
 August 2017 

I don't know whether our organisation has ever explored this or which departments would be 
involved. We have several areas of good practice where teams and departments work on quality 
improvement projects and the results of these are implemented and shared. We also collate all of 
the published research by Trust staff. We are starting to look at how information is shared in the 
Trust for the purposes of governance and identifying areas for knowledge improvement and I am 
auditing information flow which could lead to better knowledge management in non medical 
education. Better knowledge management is something that I would like to start to develop within 
the Trust but as I have only been in post a short time there are other areas which I am currently 
working on.  
Having had experience of institutional repositories in previous organisations I think these work best 
if they have buy in at a senior level and they do need to be properly and systematically managed 
and underpinned by fit for purpose policies and processes. The repository storage system should be 
easily accessible and available across teams so that knowledge can be shared and it's usefulness 
fully exploited. 

Cost - it would be too expensive for us to purchase. 

As far as the library is aware there have been no recent discussions about setting up a repository.  It 
is something the library team would like to explore further. 

 

 

 

Comments where a repository had been explored but not 

implemented 

We did not proceed as we felt we didn't have enough support from R&D department. 
I feel a repository would be very useful but probably need some positive data to share with others including R&D department. 

Kept an eye on lis-medical and comments there - DSpace, Knowledge Share and Share Point 
mentioned.  No funding here to buy a package.  Hoped new intranet might provide a solution but 
not realised yet.  Need to work with Programme Management Office (ideas for improvement via a 
'Share and Learn' template) and Governance colleagues (lessons learned monthly PowerPoint 
slides). 
I would be interested to know if Trusts are using the library management system for this purpose; it 
seems to me these are already paid for and could fairly easily provide a solution.  I think other Trusts 
use theirs for this purpose. 

costs was the biggest factor 
supplier presentations need to be meaningful and relevant 

We didn't get past the initial scoping exercise. We identified a lack of capacity in the organisation 
both within the LKS team and within the IT team. It was not an organisational priority or interest at 
the time. I also thought an NHS-wide open access repository would be a better route. 

We discussed the option of having a repository with our Research and Development Team who 
were very keen.  We wrote a business case outlining various options but never heard anything more 
about this.  We believe this to be because of cost.  Due to the current lack of appetite for the project 
we have put it on hold although we would be keen to explore this again. 

Brief look at using the catalogue as a repository for internal documents.  Unfortunately hosted and 
not secure.  Looked at Koha - was possible, but IT said they couldn't work with Apache open source 
software (Microsoft only) and there was no funds to create. 
So little research is conducted here, it is doubtful there would be a need. 

I have looked around at repositories at other Trusts, and approached a couple of the commercial 



15 
14

th
 August 2017 

options for quotes. I have discussed with R&D Team, but budget not available to take forward.  

We looked at OpenLite from at the time Springer, now Atmire. I was interested and R&D were too, 
although they were keen to point out that they shouldn't have to pay anything to support the 
project as it wasn't anything to do with their remit (!).  I had to shelve the project due to covering 
staff absence for an extended period of time - there wasn't really any other reason for not 
proceeding.  When I finally catch up from this period of cover, I intend to pick this up again. 

Looked at research publications repositories in other organisations (NHS and academic). Costs were 
prohibitive. Looked at creating one in-house but too difficult. 

Wanted to establish a database/ repository to share best practice and innovations based on work of 
the project group - http://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Main-Report.pdf.  
We still hope to take this work forward with the quality lead in the Trust so we can encourage 
spread of knowledge about QI initiatives.  Response from the Research and Innovation Lead was 
disappointing and they seem to have tried to set up some form of repository themselves but this is 
not published on the intranet nor widely available - LKS were not involved despite offering 
assistance.  We also compile updates about staff publications but we do not store copies locally. 
Different motivations in different departments and some don't seem to see the library as having a 
role here.  Would love to be able technical assistance to help set something like this up across the 
area 

investigated Biomed model either individually or in collaboration 
Repositories require high level support and commitment supported by policy and guidelines. The 
time and effort required to develop one should not be underestimated. 

I believe we got quotes from a couple of suppliers, one of whom came into the trust to talk to 
ourselves and the Research and Development Department. Cost was the main reason we did not 
proceed. 

Due to financial constraints, there appears to be a lack of appetite for a repository at the current 
time. I have only briefly looked into this, and am mulling over using our moodle system as a 
repository, which would not cost us anything other than staff time. I need to find champions for this 
among senior staff before it can move forwards. I have also had lack of time to devote to this over 
the past few months. 
Tangible benefits from other trusts from creating repositories would be a useful selling point. 

Reasons for not proceeding, time and money 
No, except that I think that all Trusts should have one but most staff usually deposit with the 
university or another organisation.

Comments from Libraries currently exploring  

 

15 responses from organisations that are currently exploring implementation of a repository.    

We have looked into using Wordpress, Libguides, free repository software - DSpace plus the hosted 
version DSpace direct and Open Repository.    The main challenges are finding funding if we go for a 
paid for version and hosting issues if we try to do something in-house. IT are also too busy at the 
moment to help us out. Setting up DSpace from scratch looks very involved.  We quite liked 
WordPress which another Trust had used but we thought it looked too time consuming to enter 
records retrospectively. 
 
I would be interested in any shared learning from this survey! 

A couple of years ago we were exploring platforms to use and then were looking at using the content 
server that the Trust uses for its intranet site.   However, now that we are working closely with a 
nearby Trust we are considering using (and sharing) their platform. 

We are just currently collating the information on a document to include on our library website and 
intranet.  We have just started this project and are working with the Research department to gather 
information for this.  As the project developments we hope to explore more effective ways to share 
this information 

We're looking at creating a repository of 'best practice' to share outcomes. It's still in its early stages 
and we're currently looking at using the Trust's Intranet site to host. We're only looking at the content 
being visible within the Trust.    There's wide spread support across the Trust. Key areas that would 
add content include Transformation, Clinical Audit - specifically F2, Communications - HSJ Awards, 
Trust scheme.    A lot of the content is available but not accessible.    The idea is that individuals and 
teams will add content with the LKS managing the platform, meta data and review dates. Each entry 
would link into the Trust objectives. This could then be used as evidence to support CQC visits. 

Currently we list publications by staff based at the Trust on our catalogue system which includes a tab 
for "staff publications". This was started by one of my predecessors and I have developed it further by 
adding more publications identified by searches. 
 
As we may be merging with another Trust it is likely the existing list may be replaced by something 
else in the future. 

Early days - we are planning to create a repository of abstracts and links to published papers by Trust 
staff, and will be investigating the use of SharePoint to host the repository. Key challenge is time and 
lack of full staff. 
I see the creation of this kind of repository as just one element of KM, but currently this is the most 

immediate and effective step to get involved and do something.

Presented idea in May 2017 to research governance committee as a means of managing the trust's 
(staff) publications and poster presentations.  Looked at what other organisations (universities and 
NHS trusts) offer. Full IR would be too expensive for an organisation of this size, so initially we will 
collate publications into spreadsheet with a view to adding to a database.  Challenge is who will add 
content and update: possibly shared responsibility between the library and the research department?   

We have a Word document, which is produced annually, of documents that have been published by 
Trust staff.      The list is available via the Intranet on our new Innovation & Research Hub, which the 
Library Manager edits on behalf of the Innovation and Research Council.    We've also started tagging 
any books on our library management system , so that they can easily be found.    Small baby steps to 
start with ... 

we are working with our research team to create a database where we can record innovations and 
publications of papers by people in the Trust.  We are hoping to access a facility via our medical 
education website to set up the searchable database.  this is taking time to engage with the right staff 
but 1 meeting has taken place and we are waiting training.  Research team have been very supportive 
as they are keen to see this happen as part of their objectives and are trying to get some funding to 
support it.  Time is a challenge as there is a lot of work pulling all the data together, project plans and 
meetings etc. 

We have looked at repositories and research hubs that other NHS Trusts have and also at university 
sites. We investigated the software being used and the cost of buying and maintaining several 
systems. We decided that the system that we preferred was one that had been developed internally 
and have asked our IT department to create something with similar capabilities for us.  We have been 
trying to get IT to do this for several years and the project has been previously rejected by an IT 
manager who has now left so we are now more hopeful and preliminary meetings have taken place.   
We are looking at a research hub and again several years ago the Head of Research didn't engage with 
the idea but is now fully supportive. 

looked at commercial providers - Eprints, Open Repository, looked at other repositories eg ORA (U 
Oxford)  All require not only set up fee but maintenance fee which we could not support and could 
not get support to finance.  Asked IT - initially said no capacity to develop.  Also asked R&D, L&D & 
business strategy team but no funding available (although all were supportive).   However a year later  
(Jan 2017)I asked again and IT this time agreed to develop using WordPress.   I set up meetings with 
R&D, Clinical Audit, Comms to discuss  - all agree it is a very good idea and support it. Our leaders 
conferences have recently raised issues around sharing and recording of local research (need to do 
this more). The repository will be able to support this, recording local projects and research, not just 
published research.  Library is to coordinate, manage and provide ongoing support. Web developer 
has produced an initial admin form and will next develop the public view. It will be hosted on the 
Trust main website. I have also asked other NHS libraries who use wordpress as a repository   - it 
seems to work well.

The library manages a staff publications database which uses Wordpress Software. We don't currently 
use this as a repository, but it could potentially be used as one and I am considering whether it might 
be 'good enough' to use until something is created nationally and getting authors to provide copies 
under green open access so we have a collection that can be used to populate something larger.    If 
there are no plans for a national NHS repository, then we may look at possible repository software 
alternatives. However, at the moment the R&I department has not expressed any desire for us to 
create a repository.    I think the main challenge is going to be time and expertise rather than 
financial, as we don't currently know enough about how to manage a repository, and we have limited 
librarian capacity. 

Have investigated hosted systems like Dspace, eprints etc  Also currently exploring with IS Oxford 
whether a module can be developed for existing LMS.  The main issue for me is that there are two 
main aspects to this   • Having a process in place which captures information for the repository (the 
cultural people bit)  • Having a way of collating/sharing this information (ie the technology)  No point 
in spending lots of money on the technology if there is not the culture bit….   

In the process of developing an in-house research repository in partnership with research and 
development.  We have explored purchasing a package or asking IT to create a database for us.  For 
the first stage we decided to go for a simple in-house solution developed by the LKS team. 

I started this work last week! We will be developing a repository as it's one of the objectives in the 
latest Training, Education and Development strategy.  I met with another Trust who shared the work 
they had done with a view to joining their system. I also looked at the work of neighbouring areas.    
We have a license for EasySite CMS and so one of the other options would be to develop a directory 
based on the work of other Trusts.  
 
Additional issues to consider - Output methods for users searching the repository. Can users print the 
record or the case study etc.    Also including video or other media in the repository.
