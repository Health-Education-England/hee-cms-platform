          <p>The pilot period has now ended and we’re in the process of finalising the project report. Today we’re sharing our findings from the post-switch searches that our participants carried out in provider interfaces between November 2020 and January 2021. We asked people to record data for one day of each week, and they filled in an online form for any searches they did that day. We had 296 searches captured, from quick 20 minute scoping searches to 16 hours’ worth of searching to support a large evidence review and everything in between. We think it’s a fascinating set of data and we could write many, many blog posts about it, but we’re showcasing some of the highlights here. If you have any burning questions about our findings that aren’t addressed here, please post them in the comments below and we’ll try and answer.</p>

          <p>Pilot participants were faced with a choice when searching, as Medline is available in all three provider interfaces – Ovid, EBSCO and Proquest. As reflected in&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/expert-search-early-adopters-pilot-pre-switch-search-data/">pre-switch search data</a>&nbsp;it continued to be the most frequently used database, with 92% of searches using Medline from one provider or another. Ovid Medline was the most frequently used resource overall (70% of searches), with Ovid EMBASE second (61%) and EBSCO CINAHL third (40%).</p>

          <p>More post switch searches were carried out over multiple sessions (57%) than in a single session (43%). The time taken to complete a search varied between 20 minutes and 16 hours. As with our&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/expert-search-early-adopters-pilot-pre-switch-search-data/">pre-switch search data</a>, there were two searches captured that fitted into the systematic review category, and as their times vastly skewed the average search time they were removed from calculations for this blog post. With the remaining 294 searches the average time to complete was 3 hours 13 minutes, with most taking between 2-3 hours or 3-4 hours (23% and 21%).</p>

          <p>Participants used many different combinations of interfaces and databases to search. The use of multiple interfaces was spread pretty evenly, with 41% using one provider interface, 39% using two and 20% using three. Where searches did use just one interface, 62% used Ovid.</p>

          <p>We asked participants to tell us what had gone well with their search, what didn’t go so well, and what changes could be made to improve their search experience. Things that worked well included the use of reference management software for amalgamating results, the ease of use of subject headings within the provider interfaces, and using one interface – where the search is carried out in multiple databases but in a single provider interface. Things that didn’t work so well included difficulty producing outputs for end user, a perception that the whole process took a lot longer, and problems with reference management software, whether it was difficulty importing results or not being able to format references in a desired style. The suggestions for improvements to the search experience covered a multitude of elements, some related to the interfaces themselves, others around issues with reference management software, the time burden of adapting to new functionality and the extra login steps needed to access databases.</p>

          <p>Finally we asked people to rate their search experience a star rating, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent. The average rating was 3, with 10% rating 1 star, 18% rating 2 stars, 42% rating 3 stars, 21% rating 4 stars and 9% rating 5 stars.</p>

          <p>The qualitative data collected about the search experience has been key in shaping the final report for the project, including recommendations for moving forward, and it will be published towards the end of April. For any questions about the project, please email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Emily.hurt@lthtr.nhs.uk">Emily.hurt@lthtr.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

As with our&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/expert-search-early-adopters-pilot-pre-switch-search-data/">pre-switch search data</a>, there were two searches captured that fitted into the systematic review category, and as their times vastly skewed the average search time they were removed from calculations for this blog post. With the remaining 294 searches the average time to complete was 3 hours 13 minutes, with most taking between 2-3 hours or 3-4 hours (23% and 21%).</p>

          <p>Participants used many different combinations of interfaces and databases to search. The use of multiple interfaces was spread pretty evenly, with 41% using one provider interface, 39% using two and 20% using three. Where searches did use just one interface, 62% used Ovid.</p>

          <p>We asked participants to tell us what had gone well with their search, what didn’t go so well, and what changes could be made to improve their search experience. Things that worked well included the use of reference management software for amalgamating results, the ease of use of subject headings within the provider interfaces, and using one interface – where the search is carried out in multiple databases but in a single provider interface. Things that didn’t work so well included difficulty producing outputs for end user, a perception that the whole process took a lot longer, and problems with reference management software, whether it was difficulty importing results or not being able to format references in a desired style. The suggestions for improvements to the search experience covered a multitude of elements, some related to the interfaces themselves, others around issues with reference management software, the time burden of adapting to new functionality and the extra login steps needed to access databases.</p>

          <p>Finally we asked people to rate their search experience a star rating, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent. The average rating was 3, with 10% rating 1 star, 18% rating 2 stars, 42% rating 3 stars, 21% rating 4 stars and 9% rating 5 stars.</p>

          <p>The qualitative data collected about the search experience has been key in shaping the final report for the project, including recommendations for moving forward, and it will be published towards the end of April.

          <p>Chaired by digital guru&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/topol/">Dr Eric Topol</a>, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://topol.hee.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Review</a> anticipated the impact of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, digital medicine and genomics on the functions and roles of the current and future healthcare workforce. &nbsp;This Spring Health Education England (HEE) brought together authors of the report to reflect on changes since 2019. Prof. Lionel Tarassenko chaired a meeting with some of the Review Board, while I led a fascinating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/digital-readiness/topol-review-2-years-on?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Orlo">roundtable discussion</a>&nbsp;with the clinical fellows who worked on the report.</p>

          <p>The Review was well supported by knowledge specialists and knowledge managers as they considered the existing evidence base, scanned the horizon and managed the work. Thanks are due to the expertise of the team at Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust led by Rachel Cooke, and our own HEE Knowledge Management service, managed by Emily Hopkins.</p>

          <p><strong>Citizens and patients at the centre: the importance of health literacy</strong></p>

          <p>The Topol Review placed the needs of patients and the public at its centre. The recommendations emphasise the importance of public health education initiatives and of working in collaboration with voluntary groups and information providers.</p>

          <p>HEE’s national knowledge and library services team has since developed a suite of health literacy resources. Have you completed the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/healthliteracy" target="_blank">e-learning programme</a>&nbsp;produced in partnership with public health colleagues within HEE and with NHS Education for Scotland? Health literacy awareness training, including a “train-the-trainer” programme, has been delivered to NHS knowledge and library staff across England and this provides a foundation for the next stage.</p>

          <p>Working with organisations which provide information and are able to support citizens develop information skills, Ruth Carlyle is leading a significant initiative to build a sustainable health literacy partnership. Over the next five years we will be working in partnership with public libraries, prison libraries, with pharmacists and with education libraries.</p>

          <p><strong>Adopting new technologies in health knowledge services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>The opportunities flagged by the Review are reflected throughout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-2026</a>,&nbsp; particularly in relation to our work on resource discovery, led by Helen Bingham.</p>

          <p><strong>Using AI to enhance access to evidence</strong></p>

          <p>AI is helping to improve the search experience and reduce the time it takes to summarise and synthesise evidence. &nbsp;Products like Yewno Discover, EBSCO’s Knowledge Graphs and 2Dsearch can help searchers to visualise and construct complex searches, navigating volumes of knowledge to retrieve information. This can make advanced and expert searching more accessible to the novice user. For knowledge specialists, these products can help to save time, act as a prompt to include additional search terms and help with communicating search strategies to end-users.</p>

          <p>AI and machine learning are also showing promise in the field of systematic review and evidence synthesis. Recent work by Jon Brassey et al<a name="_ednref1" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/#_edn1">[i]</a>&nbsp;shows that machine learning can effectively identify, assess and collate research findings to produce evidence maps, pointing to time-savings in synthesising evidence</p>

          <p>HEE is supporting a trial of&nbsp;<a href="a-glimpse-of-the-future--irisai-in-mersey-care-evi_1">Yewno Discover</a>&nbsp;with the University Hospitals Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust to explore how staff and learners might benefit from an AI-based approach to searching. Examples of other work in the field include the use of the&nbsp;<a href="a-glimpse-of-the-future--irisai-in-mersey-care-evi">RobotAnalyst</a>&nbsp;tool by NICE and the MetaVerse tool by Public Health England. A trial of the <a href="a-glimpse-of-the-future--irisai-in-mersey-care-evi_2">IRIS.AI</a>&nbsp;system by MerseyCare NHS Foundation Trust, to read all Open Access papers, added depth to the search for clinicians and researchers.</p>

          <p><strong>Integrating evidence into the clinical workflow</strong></p>

          <p>There are significant opportunities to improve the accessibility of evidence through direct integration with clinical workflows.&nbsp; HEE subscribes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/hee/">BMJ BestPractice</a>&nbsp;clinical decision support tool for all NHSW staff and learners in England.&nbsp; A recent study<a name="_ednref2" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/#_edn2">[ii]</a>&nbsp;has shown that integrating BMJ BestPractice into wider clinical decision support system can improve consistency of diagnosis and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/bmj-best-practice-linked-to-improved-patient-care-when-integrated-into-hospital-system/">reduce average stays</a>&nbsp;from 7 days to 6 days. BMJ Best Practice and HEE are collaborating to promote the integration of BMJ Best Practice into electronic health record systems to ensure that practitioners have access to the evidence at the point of need.</p>

          <p><strong>Developing as a specialist workforce</strong></p>

          <p>The Review recommended an increase in the number of knowledge specialists to meet the demands of the NHS as a knowledge-based industry.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-2026</a>&nbsp;emphasises the importance of workforce planning and development for our specialist workforce.</p>

          <p>In the light of the&nbsp;<a href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/">Topol Review</a>&nbsp;the team has put a lot of thought into how best to enable healthcare knowledge specialists, librarians – everyone in the team – to build their knowledge and enhance their skills to deliver the digital future. Dominic Gilroy leads our workstream on workforce planning and development and again, it is timely to share our progress.</p>

          <p><strong>Policy recommendations</strong></p>

          <p>HEE has approved several new policies to support the Topol recommendation, not least establishing a recommended minimum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/documents/HEE%20LKS%20Staff%20Ratio%20Policy%20January%202020.pdf">staff ratio</a>. This is a key action by HEE to enable individual organisations to identify and address the risk that they may have insufficient capacity to maximise the benefit of knowledge specialist roles to inform the spread of innovation.</p>

          <p><strong>An updated CILIP Professional Knowledge and Skills Base</strong></p>

          <p>HEE worked with CILIP to revise the Professional Knowledge and Skills Base (PKSB), and with thanks to Dominic who played a key role in the working group.&nbsp; Through discussion with Dr Andrew Cox, the author of the CILIP Technology Review – itself a response to the Topol report – we have ensured that key skills and competencies relating to digital technologies are included in the new PKSB which will be launched later in the year. There will also be new healthcare sector guidance as a companion to the main PKSB – to be launched early this summer.</p>

          <p><strong>Library Carpentry for NHS Librarians</strong></p>

          <p>To build the data and programming skills of NHS Knowledge and Library Specialists, HEE has joined&nbsp;<a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/test/">Library Carpentry</a>.&nbsp; We will be running training courses for sixty librarians through 2021/2. There will then be an opportunity for six people who have undertaken the course to be trained to deliver the course.&nbsp; Holly Case-Wyatt is leading on this partnership.</p>

          <p>Library Carpentry workshops build software and data programming skills for people working in library and information settings. This will allow participants to automate repetitive library functions and enhance evidence by adding another angle of analysis. These skills will also enable our workforce to further support the needs of students and researchers in the NHS, may of who will need to use software within their research. The Carpentries have already reported receiving enquiries from other disciplines, including Healthcare Scientists and consultants.</p>

          <p><strong>How can we keep up to date?</strong></p>

          <p>Thanks to the HEE KM team, which produces a monthly round-up&nbsp;about emerging&nbsp;technologies in libraries, we can all follow developments in the field. Sign up via:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:KnowledgeManagement@hee.nhs.uk">KnowledgeManagement@hee.nhs.uk</a></p>

          <p>We are equally grateful to the Emerging Technologies Group, co-chaired by Stephen Ayre and Hannah Wood. They scan the digital horizon and let us all know when they spot something that might impact on the information world. They have written several blogs, including:&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/tag/emerging-technologies/">enhancing wifi connections</a>&nbsp;to improve the experience of working from home, and a review of the&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/tag/emerging-technologies/page/2/">AI for Healthcare MOOC</a>&nbsp;delivered by HEE in partnership with Manchester University.&nbsp; You might also check out the webinar on&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/tag/emerging-technologies/page/2/">Virtual Reality</a>&nbsp;in health libraries.</p>

          <p><strong>Developing a Certificate in Digital Technologies</strong></p>

          <p>Recognising that knowledge and library specialists need to enhance their skills for a digital healthcare system, we believe the NHS needs people who understand more about AI, Machine Learning, robotics and other technologies. More generic digital knowledge, sometimes called “computational sense” is also required to inform handling enquiries from health professionals, and to be able to signpost and advise appropriately.&nbsp; In an exciting new initiative, we are partnering with HEE’s&nbsp;<a href="https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/">National School of Healthcare Science</a>&nbsp;and Manchester University to develop a Digital Technologies Certificate that will be for all NHS staff including knowledge and library specialists.</p>

          <p>To quote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare</a>: “Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and robotics are reshaping the ways teams create, discover, use and share information. We expect the emergence of new roles and responsibilities for knowledge and library service staff working alongside clinical teams and health informaticians.”</p>

          <p>There are significant opportunities to improve the accessibility of evidence through direct integration with clinical workflows.&nbsp; HEE subscribes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/hee/">BMJ BestPractice</a>&nbsp;clinical decision support tool for all NHSW staff and learners in England.&nbsp; A recent study<a name="_ednref2" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/#_edn2">[ii]</a>&nbsp;has shown that integrating BMJ BestPractice into wider clinical decision support system can improve consistency of diagnosis and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/bmj-best-practice-linked-to-improved-patient-care-when-integrated-into-hospital-system/">reduce average stays</a>&nbsp;from 7 days to 6 days. BMJ Best Practice and HEE are collaborating to promote the integration of BMJ Best Practice into electronic health record systems to ensure that practitioners have access to the evidence at the point of need.</p>

          <p><strong>Developing as a specialist workforce</strong></p>

          <p>The Review recommended an increase in the number of knowledge specialists to meet the demands of the NHS as a knowledge-based industry.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-2026</a>&nbsp;emphasises the importance of workforce planning and development for our specialist workforce.</p>

          <p>In the light of the&nbsp;<a href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/">Topol Review</a>&nbsp;the team has put a lot of thought into how best to enable healthcare knowledge specialists, librarians – everyone in the team – to build their knowledge and enhance their skills to deliver the digital future. Dominic Gilroy leads our workstream on workforce planning and development and again, it is timely to share our progress.</p>

          <p><strong>Policy recommendations</strong></p>

          <p>HEE has approved several new policies to support the Topol recommendation, not least establishing a recommended minimum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/sites/default/files/documents/HEE%20LKS%20Staff%20Ratio%20Policy%20January%202020.pdf">staff ratio</a>. This is a key action by HEE to enable individual organisations to identify and address the risk that they may have insufficient capacity to maximise the benefit of knowledge specialist roles to inform the spread of innovation.</p>

          <p><strong>An updated CILIP Professional Knowledge and Skills Base</strong></p>

          <p>HEE worked with CILIP to revise the Professional Knowledge and Skills Base (PKSB), and with thanks to Dominic who played a key role in the working group.&nbsp; Through discussion with Dr Andrew Cox, the author of the CILIP Technology Review – itself a response to the Topol report – we have ensured that key skills and competencies relating to digital technologies are included in the new PKSB which will be launched later in the year. There will also be new healthcare sector guidance as a companion to the main PKSB – to be launched early this summer.</p>

          <p><strong>Library Carpentry for NHS Librarians</strong></p>

          <p>To build the data and programming skills of NHS Knowledge and Library Specialists, HEE has joined&nbsp;<a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/test/">Library Carpentry</a>.&nbsp; We will be running training courses for sixty librarians through 2021/2. There will then be an opportunity for six people who have undertaken the course to be trained to deliver the course.&nbsp; Holly Case-Wyatt is leading on this partnership.</p>

          <p>Library Carpentry workshops build software and data programming skills for people working in library and information settings. This will allow participants to automate repetitive library functions and enhance evidence by adding another angle of analysis. These skills will also enable our workforce to further support the needs of students and researchers in the NHS, may of who will need to use software within their research. The Carpentries have already reported receiving enquiries from other disciplines, including Healthcare Scientists and consultants.</p>

          <p><strong>How can we keep up to date?</strong></p>

          <p>Thanks to the HEE KM team, which produces a monthly round-up&nbsp;about emerging&nbsp;technologies in libraries, we can all follow developments in the field. Sign up via:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:KnowledgeManagement@hee.nhs.uk">KnowledgeManagement@hee.nhs.uk</a></p>

          <p>We are equally grateful to the Emerging Technologies Group, co-chaired by Stephen Ayre and Hannah Wood. They scan the digital horizon and let us all know when they spot something that might impact on the information world. They have written several blogs, including:&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/tag/emerging-technologies/">enhancing wifi connections</a>&nbsp;to improve the experience of working from home, and a review of the&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/tag/emerging-technologies/page/2/">AI for Healthcare MOOC</a>&nbsp;delivered by HEE in partnership with Manchester University.&nbsp; You might also check out the webinar on&nbsp;<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/tag/emerging-technologies/page/2/">Virtual Reality</a>&nbsp;in health libraries.</p>

          <p><strong>Developing a Certificate in Digital Technologies</strong></p>

          <p>Recognising that knowledge and library specialists need to enhance their skills for a digital healthcare system, we believe the NHS needs people who understand more about AI, Machine Learning, robotics and other technologies. More generic digital knowledge, sometimes called “computational sense” is also required to inform handling enquiries from health professionals, and to be able to signpost and advise appropriately.&nbsp; In an exciting new initiative, we are partnering with HEE’s&nbsp;<a href="https://nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/">National School of Healthcare Science</a>&nbsp;and Manchester University to develop a Digital Technologies Certificate that will be for all NHS staff including knowledge and library specialists.</p>

          <p>To quote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare</a>: “Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and robotics are reshaping the ways teams create, discover, use and share information. We expect the emergence of new roles and responsibilities for knowledge and library service staff working alongside clinical teams and health informaticians.”</p>

          <p>Chaired by digital guru&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/topol/">Dr Eric Topol</a>, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://topol.hee.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Review</a> anticipated the impact of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning, digital medicine and genomics on the functions and roles of the current and future healthcare workforce. &nbsp;This Spring Health Education England (HEE) brought together authors of the report to reflect on changes since 2019. Prof. Lionel Tarassenko chaired a meeting with some of the Review Board, while I led a fascinating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/digital-readiness/topol-review-2-years-on?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Orlo">roundtable discussion</a>&nbsp;with the clinical fellows who worked on the report.</p>

          <p>The Review was well supported by knowledge specialists and knowledge managers as they considered the existing evidence base, scanned the horizon and managed the work. Thanks are due to the expertise of the team at Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust led by Rachel Cooke, and our own HEE Knowledge Management service, managed by Emily Hopkins.</p>

          <p><strong>Citizens and patients at the centre: the importance of health literacy</strong></p>

          <p>The Topol Review placed the needs of patients and the public at its centre. The recommendations emphasise the importance of public health education initiatives and of working in collaboration with voluntary groups and information providers.</p>

          <p>HEE’s national knowledge and library services team has since developed a suite of health literacy resources. Have you completed the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/healthliteracy" target="_blank">e-learning programme</a>&nbsp;produced in partnership with public health colleagues within HEE and with NHS Education for Scotland? Health literacy awareness training, including a “train-the-trainer” programme, has been delivered to NHS knowledge and library staff across England and this provides a foundation for the next stage.</p>

          <p>Working with organisations which provide information and are able to support citizens develop information skills, Ruth Carlyle is leading a significant initiative to build a sustainable health literacy partnership. Over the next five years we will be working in partnership with public libraries, prison libraries, with pharmacists and with education libraries.</p>

          <p><strong>Adopting new technologies in health knowledge services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>The opportunities flagged by the Review are reflected throughout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare 2021-2026</a>,&nbsp; particularly in relation to our work on resource discovery, led by Helen Bingham.</p>

          <p><strong>Using AI to enhance access to evidence</strong></p>

          <p>AI is helping to improve the search experience and reduce the time it takes to summarise and synthesise evidence. &nbsp;Products like Yewno Discover, EBSCO’s Knowledge Graphs and 2Dsearch can help searchers to visualise and construct complex searches, navigating volumes of knowledge to retrieve information. This can make advanced and expert searching more accessible to the novice user. For knowledge specialists, these products can help to save time, act as a prompt to include additional search terms and help with communicating search strategies to end-users.</p>

          <p>AI and machine learning are also showing promise in the field of systematic review and evidence synthesis. Recent work by Jon Brassey et al<a name="_ednref1" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/#_edn1">[i]</a>&nbsp;shows that machine learning can effectively identify, assess and collate research findings to produce evidence maps, pointing to time-savings in synthesising evidence</p>

          <p>HEE is supporting a trial of&nbsp;<a href="a-glimpse-of-the-future--irisai-in-mersey-care-evi_1">Yewno Discover</a>&nbsp;with the University Hospitals Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust to explore how staff and learners might benefit from an AI-based approach to searching. Examples of other work in the field include the use of the&nbsp;<a href="a-glimpse-of-the-future--irisai-in-mersey-care-evi">RobotAnalyst</a>&nbsp;tool by NICE and the MetaVerse tool by Public Health England. A trial of the <a href="a-glimpse-of-the-future--irisai-in-mersey-care-evi_2">IRIS.AI</a>&nbsp;system by MerseyCare NHS Foundation Trust, to read all Open Access papers, added depth to the search for clinicians and researchers.</p>

          <p><strong>Integrating evidence into the clinical workflow</strong></p>

          <p>There are significant opportunities to improve the accessibility of evidence through direct integration with clinical workflows.&nbsp; HEE subscribes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/hee/">BMJ BestPractice</a>&nbsp;clinical decision support tool for all NHSW staff and learners in England.&nbsp; A recent study<a name="_ednref2" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/#_edn2">[ii]</a>&nbsp;has shown that integrating BMJ BestPractice into wider clinical decision support system can improve consistency of diagnosis and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/bmj-best-practice-linked-to-improved-patient-care-when-integrated-into-hospital-system/">reduce average stays</a>&nbsp;from 7 days to 6 days.

          <p>The PKSB provides an excellent framework for individuals to map their existing knowledge and skills against the requirements of their current or future roles, identify gaps, and prioritise professional development.&nbsp; For service managers and organisations, the tool is indispensable, helping to identify skills and knowledge gaps within a team and thereby inform training and development plans.</p>

          <p>The revised PKSB has been extended to reflect the growing importance of skills in data handling and knowledge management, and to incorporate recommendations around digital skills identified by CILIP’s Technology Review.</p>

          <p>Developed by a cross-sectoral working group, the PKSB itself is generic, applying to library and information professionals in any sector. It can easily be adapted to many different areas of the profession.&nbsp; Health Education England, and knowledge and library specialists, have also worked with CILIP to produce Health Guidance Notes which provide practical examples of how the knowledge and skills identified in the PKSB may apply to roles in health context.</p>

          <h3>What has changed in the new PKSB?</h3>

          <p>Perhaps the most obvious change to the structure of the PKSB is two new sections about Data Management and Knowledge Management.&nbsp; These reflect the growing importance of skills in these areas for information professionals as well as a growth in CILIP membership from colleagues specialising in these fields.</p>

          <p>The relevance of Knowledge Management skills for health knowledge and library specialists is explicit in the priorities set by the Knowledge for Healthcare strategy. The need to manage information and share lessons learned have become high profile through the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A glance at the Data Management section reveals skills such as AI and Algorithmic Literacy which includes “Critically evaluating automated search….processes.”&nbsp; This is surely a familiar skill to any colleague who has helped users to understand how search engines work.</p>

          <p>This and other additions also reflect the findings of CILIP’s Technology Review, the profession’s response to the Topol Review.&nbsp; Emerging technologies are changing the delivery of knowledge services. New skills here include the intriguingly entitled “Computational Sense” which captures the unique skills of knowledge and library specialists in adapting and adopting new technologies and acting as a bridge between the needs of users and those developing technologies.</p>

          <p>Other changes include:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Moving the Core Principles to the start of the document and explicitly referencing “Professional Development” among these principles</li>
           <li>An emphasis on the importance of taking a leadership role at all levels</li>
           <li>Expanding the section on literacies and learning including digital, media, and health literacy</li>
           <li>Inclusion of new generic skills including Reflective Practice, Team Working, Consultancy and Consultancy Services.</li>
           <li>Strengthening of the document to address bias and reflect our commitment to equality, diversity, and inclusion.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Where will I find the PKSB and the Health Guidance?</strong></h3>

          <p>The PKSB is made freely available to all NHS knowledge and library staff in England through a partnership agreement between Health Education England and CILIP.</p>

          <p>The tool remains the intellectual property of CILIP and for this reason you are not permitted to share the resources.&nbsp; You should receive an email from Health Education England including details of how to access the resource but if you have any problems accessing the documents you should contact: &nbsp;<a href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk</a></p>

          <p>Following the full launch of the PKSB by CILIP in the summer all CILIP members will have access to the PKSB and associated guidance, including an online interactive version of the PKSB.</p>

          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><u>I am part way through professional registration. What does this mean for me?</u></strong></p>

          <p>To avoid any potential confusion, CILIP encourages colleagues who are currently undertaking Professional Registration (Certification, Chartership, Fellowship) to use the same version of the PKSB throughout the process.</p>

          <h3><strong>Facet Publications Discount</strong></h3>

          <p>The PKSB Healthcare Sector Guidance lists a number of Facet titles which may be of interest in developing skills against each section of the PKSB.&nbsp; Between 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;May and 31<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;August Facet is offering a 15% discount against all print titles listed in the PKSB Healthcare Sector Guidance for any colleagues who may not be CILIP members</p>

          <p><a href="pksb-promo-titles.odt">List of titles</a>&nbsp;(OpenDocument Text)</p>

          <p><a href="pksb-promo-title-isbn-list.ods">List of titles</a>&nbsp;(OpenDocument Spreadsheet)</p>

          <p>When ordering these titles please use the discount code&nbsp;<strong>PKSBHEE15</strong></p>

          <p>A reminder that&nbsp;CILIP members already receive a 35% discount&nbsp;on Facet titles at all times.</p>

          <h3><strong>Accessing the new PKSB</strong></h3>

          <p>NHS knowledge and library colleagues should receive an email from Heath Education England via their Library Manager including details of how to access the resource but if you have any problems accessing the documents you should contact: &nbsp;<a href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

          <p>At a recent workshop the statement was made that no-one understands the term knowledge mobilisation explaining that it needs to be translated to have meaning within the specific cultural context of a particular organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what words do you use to describe knowledge mobilisation for your own organisation?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Sharing&nbsp;ideas; reflecting; connecting;&nbsp;experiential learning;&nbsp;networking; using organisational knowledge; sharing&nbsp;information; learning&nbsp;lessons;&nbsp;using evidence; managing knowledge;&nbsp;translating&nbsp;knowledge; organisational&nbsp;learning;&nbsp;using know-how;&nbsp;learning before, during and after; transferring knowledge; sharing good practice and ideas; connecting people.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The&nbsp;good thing about the&nbsp;term “knowledge mobilisation” is that it encompasses all of the above&nbsp;but this also&nbsp;makes it tricky to&nbsp;define.&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking&nbsp;the term&nbsp;down may help.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;That which is explicit or documented – research, data-sets, guidelines and that which is tacit – the know-how and values held by individuals and within organisations based upon wisdom and experience&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>MOBILISATION:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Organising and preparing for action&nbsp;– considering&nbsp;how knowledge is&nbsp;to be&nbsp;used&nbsp;to achieve a particular purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge Mobilisation is about connecting and encouraging people to share explicit and tacit knowledge &nbsp;<strong>AND&nbsp;</strong> to&nbsp;<strong> USE  </strong>this knowledge to inform their decision making. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>This definition was reflected on a discussion board by participants at the recent&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="http://knowledgemobilisation.net/" target="_blank">UK Knowledge Mobilisation Forum</a>:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>“Getting the right knowledge to the right people at the right time so they can use it in a way to aid in their decisions and sometimes this right knowledge is also about getting the right people to the right people at the right time”&nbsp;</li>
           <li>“Knowledge Mobilisation is about bringing together different communities to share knowledge to catalyse change”&nbsp;</li>
           <li>“Joining up /connecting different forms of&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;(from research, from practice, from&nbsp;experience,&nbsp;etc) helping people make sense of it all and how it joins up to build a clearer picture”&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>&nbsp;<strong>An easy-read description</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Within Knowledge for Healthcare (HEE, 2021) one of the key strands of work relates to mobilising evidence and knowledge.&nbsp; In the easy-read version of the strategy (HEE, 2021) this is simply described as “Getting the right information from different places and sharing it” and this “right information” can be from reports, research , the&nbsp; internet and from the things people know but haven’t written down.&nbsp; People can then use this knowledge to help inform their decisions and actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>What about knowledge management?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Some prefer the term knowledge management but this too lacks an agreed definition (BSI, 2018) and often gets confused with information management (Payne, 2020).&nbsp; Knowledge management has been described by Nancy Dixon as evolving through three eras over the last 20 years.&nbsp; The first era relates to leveraging documented knowledge, creating a collection and connecting people to it.&nbsp; The second is concerned with leveraging experiential knowledge which is primarily concerned with connecting people to people and the third era is about leveraging collective knowledge and is primarily about creating new knowledge and innovation often from conversations (Dixon, 2018).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently there has been discussion about&nbsp;&nbsp;the evolution of a fourth era, some consider that this will reflect technological changes with increased use of artificial intelligence whereas others feel there is a further stage of collaboration emerging (Henley Forum, 2020; CILIP, 2020)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge Mobilisation incorporates all of these phases as described by Dixon and many of the processes, tools and techniques commonly associated with knowledge management are part of the knowledge specialists’&nbsp;toolkit to mobilise knowledge.&nbsp; The decision to substitute the word mobilisation for management is however very deliberate.&nbsp; Rather than control and organise knowledge our role as knowledge specialists is about enabling others to actively use knowledge to inform&nbsp;their&nbsp;decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Where does evidence fit into all of this?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Knowledge Mobilisation is also concerned with enabling the use of evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence comes in many forms and varying degrees of quality and volume depending on the topic. It is often research published in peer-reviewed journals, or&nbsp;as reports. <strong>Evidence based practice</strong> emphasises the importance of understanding and applying the evidence taking into consideration other factors including expert knowledge and values. &nbsp;Decisions&nbsp;must&nbsp;take account of the best available evidence and individual and organisational knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enabling evidence-based practice must consider the capture and mobilisation of knowledge as well as evidence.&nbsp;Knowledge specialists enable decision makers to take account of this full continuum.  &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>The valuable role of the knowledge specialist</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>The Knowledge Specialists’&nbsp;role is crucial,&nbsp;not only providing access to evidence,&nbsp;perhaps as books or&nbsp;research databases, but also gathering examples of good practice and&nbsp;connecting people to&nbsp;actively&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;and insights to be shared.&nbsp; To mobilise knowledge the knowledge specialist translates and transforms&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this knowledge so it can be easily used and applied in practice by the people working within healthcare organisations, services and systems.&nbsp; Sometimes described as a “knowledge broker” the knowledge specialist uses their expertise to&nbsp;ensure healthcare organisations, services and systems are effective in mobilising evidence and internally generated knowledge. They also&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;healthcare staff&nbsp;can:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Apply and use evidence&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Build know-how&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Continue to learn&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Drive innovation </li>
          </ul>

          <p>They do this by:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Connecting people to people&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to knowledge and&nbsp;the evidence base&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to good practice</li>
           <li>Ensuring&nbsp;&nbsp;people&nbsp;&nbsp;keep up to date&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Facilitating shared learning&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to corporate knowledge</li>
           <li>Enabling collegiate working&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Aligned to multidisciplinary teams, embedded knowledge specialists release the time of health professionals by seeking out evidence and good practice. They are often asked to synthesise and summarise information, working with clinical&nbsp;or&nbsp;management teams&nbsp;to deliver decision-ready&nbsp;evidence and knowledge.&nbsp; They promote tools and techniques so teams&nbsp;can capture, share and re-use staff know-how&nbsp;and organisational knowledge; enabling teams to learn continuously and work collegiately.&nbsp; Mobilised in this way knowledge is used&nbsp;to underpin strategy,&nbsp;operations&nbsp;and&nbsp;innovation and helps&nbsp;to&nbsp;foster a&nbsp;learning&nbsp;culture.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>But, another team does this in my organisation.</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Some of the aspects of knowledge mobilisation may be carried out by other teams within the organisation.&nbsp; Chris Collison describes it as one country bordered by many, including organisational development, research, project management, quality improvement, informatics, education and training, transformation to name but a few (Collison, 2014).&nbsp; One role for the knowledge specialist is therefore to build bridges with these other disciplines and to work in partnership with these teams to align knowledge mobilisation activities.&nbsp; Recently an example of how knowledge mobilisation activities mapped to a quality improvement cycle was shared on Twitter (Gibbons, 2021):</p>

          <h2><strong>A picture says more than a thousand words</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>If we use “knowledge mobilisation” with conviction to describe the valuable work&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;and&nbsp;library specialists do&nbsp;then there will be less of a necessity to reach for an alternative for each separate NHS organisation or system.&nbsp; You may find that a single image encapsulates all of this much more effectively.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The bottom-line is that knowledge mobilisation, when done well,&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;NHS bodies, their staff, learners, patients and the public to use the right knowledge and evidence, at the right time, in the right place, enabling high quality decision-making, learning, research and innovation to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It is often research published in peer-reviewed journals, or&nbsp;as reports. <strong>Evidence based practice</strong> emphasises the importance of understanding and applying the evidence taking into consideration other factors including expert knowledge and values. &nbsp;Decisions&nbsp;must&nbsp;take account of the best available evidence and individual and organisational knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enabling evidence-based practice must consider the capture and mobilisation of knowledge as well as evidence.&nbsp;Knowledge specialists enable decision makers to take account of this full continuum.  &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>The valuable role of the knowledge specialist</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>The Knowledge Specialists’&nbsp;role is crucial,&nbsp;not only providing access to evidence,&nbsp;perhaps as books or&nbsp;research databases, but also gathering examples of good practice and&nbsp;connecting people to&nbsp;actively&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;and insights to be shared.&nbsp; To mobilise knowledge the knowledge specialist translates and transforms&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this knowledge so it can be easily used and applied in practice by the people working within healthcare organisations, services and systems.&nbsp; Sometimes described as a “knowledge broker” the knowledge specialist uses their expertise to&nbsp;ensure healthcare organisations, services and systems are effective in mobilising evidence and internally generated knowledge. They also&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;healthcare staff&nbsp;can:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Apply and use evidence&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Build know-how&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Continue to learn&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Drive innovation </li>
          </ul>

          <p>They do this by:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Connecting people to people&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to knowledge and&nbsp;the evidence base&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to good practice</li>
           <li>Ensuring&nbsp;&nbsp;people&nbsp;&nbsp;keep up to date&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Facilitating shared learning&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to corporate knowledge</li>
           <li>Enabling collegiate working&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Aligned to multidisciplinary teams, embedded knowledge specialists release the time of health professionals by seeking out evidence and good practice. They are often asked to synthesise and summarise information, working with clinical&nbsp;or&nbsp;management teams&nbsp;to deliver decision-ready&nbsp;evidence and knowledge.&nbsp; They promote tools and techniques so teams&nbsp;can capture, share and re-use staff know-how&nbsp;and organisational knowledge; enabling teams to learn continuously and work collegiately.&nbsp; Mobilised in this way knowledge is used&nbsp;to underpin strategy,&nbsp;operations&nbsp;and&nbsp;innovation and helps&nbsp;to&nbsp;foster a&nbsp;learning&nbsp;culture.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>But, another team does this in my organisation.</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Some of the aspects of knowledge mobilisation may be carried out by other teams within the organisation.&nbsp; Chris Collison describes it as one country bordered by many, including organisational development, research, project management, quality improvement, informatics, education and training, transformation to name but a few (Collison, 2014).&nbsp; One role for the knowledge specialist is therefore to build bridges with these other disciplines and to work in partnership with these teams to align knowledge mobilisation activities.&nbsp; Recently an example of how knowledge mobilisation activities mapped to a quality improvement cycle was shared on Twitter (Gibbons, 2021):</p>

          <p>At a recent workshop the statement was made that no-one understands the term knowledge mobilisation explaining that it needs to be translated to have meaning within the specific cultural context of a particular organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;So what words do you use to describe knowledge mobilisation for your own organisation?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Sharing&nbsp;ideas; reflecting; connecting;&nbsp;experiential learning;&nbsp;networking; using organisational knowledge; sharing&nbsp;information; learning&nbsp;lessons;&nbsp;using evidence; managing knowledge;&nbsp;translating&nbsp;knowledge; organisational&nbsp;learning;&nbsp;using know-how;&nbsp;learning before, during and after; transferring knowledge; sharing good practice and ideas; connecting people.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The&nbsp;good thing about the&nbsp;term “knowledge mobilisation” is that it encompasses all of the above&nbsp;but this also&nbsp;makes it tricky to&nbsp;define.&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking&nbsp;the term&nbsp;down may help.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;That which is explicit or documented – research, data-sets, guidelines and that which is tacit – the know-how and values held by individuals and within organisations based upon wisdom and experience&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>MOBILISATION:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Organising and preparing for action&nbsp;– considering&nbsp;how knowledge is&nbsp;to be&nbsp;used&nbsp;to achieve a particular purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge Mobilisation is about connecting and encouraging people to share explicit and tacit knowledge &nbsp;<strong>AND&nbsp;</strong> to&nbsp;<strong> USE  </strong>this knowledge to inform their decision making. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>This definition was reflected on a discussion board by participants at the recent&nbsp;<a rel="noopener" href="http://knowledgemobilisation.net/" target="_blank">UK Knowledge Mobilisation Forum</a>:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>“Getting the right knowledge to the right people at the right time so they can use it in a way to aid in their decisions and sometimes this right knowledge is also about getting the right people to the right people at the right time”&nbsp;</li>
           <li>“Knowledge Mobilisation is about bringing together different communities to share knowledge to catalyse change”&nbsp;</li>
           <li>“Joining up /connecting different forms of&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;(from research, from practice, from&nbsp;experience,&nbsp;etc) helping people make sense of it all and how it joins up to build a clearer picture”&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>&nbsp;<strong>An easy-read description</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Within Knowledge for Healthcare (HEE, 2021) one of the key strands of work relates to mobilising evidence and knowledge.&nbsp; In the easy-read version of the strategy (HEE, 2021) this is simply described as “Getting the right information from different places and sharing it” and this “right information” can be from reports, research , the&nbsp; internet and from the things people know but haven’t written down.&nbsp; People can then use this knowledge to help inform their decisions and actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>What about knowledge management?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Some prefer the term knowledge management but this too lacks an agreed definition (BSI, 2018) and often gets confused with information management (Payne, 2020).&nbsp; Knowledge management has been described by Nancy Dixon as evolving through three eras over the last 20 years.&nbsp; The first era relates to leveraging documented knowledge, creating a collection and connecting people to it.&nbsp; The second is concerned with leveraging experiential knowledge which is primarily concerned with connecting people to people and the third era is about leveraging collective knowledge and is primarily about creating new knowledge and innovation often from conversations (Dixon, 2018).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently there has been discussion about&nbsp;&nbsp;the evolution of a fourth era, some consider that this will reflect technological changes with increased use of artificial intelligence whereas others feel there is a further stage of collaboration emerging (Henley Forum, 2020; CILIP, 2020)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge Mobilisation incorporates all of these phases as described by Dixon and many of the processes, tools and techniques commonly associated with knowledge management are part of the knowledge specialists’&nbsp;toolkit to mobilise knowledge.&nbsp; The decision to substitute the word mobilisation for management is however very deliberate.&nbsp; Rather than control and organise knowledge our role as knowledge specialists is about enabling others to actively use knowledge to inform&nbsp;their&nbsp;decisions and actions.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Where does evidence fit into all of this?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Knowledge Mobilisation is also concerned with enabling the use of evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence comes in many forms and varying degrees of quality and volume depending on the topic. It is often research published in peer-reviewed journals, or&nbsp;as reports. <strong>Evidence based practice</strong> emphasises the importance of understanding and applying the evidence taking into consideration other factors including expert knowledge and values. &nbsp;Decisions&nbsp;must&nbsp;take account of the best available evidence and individual and organisational knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enabling evidence-based practice must consider the capture and mobilisation of knowledge as well as evidence.&nbsp;Knowledge specialists enable decision makers to take account of this full continuum.  &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>The valuable role of the knowledge specialist</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>The Knowledge Specialists’&nbsp;role is crucial,&nbsp;not only providing access to evidence,&nbsp;perhaps as books or&nbsp;research databases, but also gathering examples of good practice and&nbsp;connecting people to&nbsp;actively&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;and insights to be shared.&nbsp; To mobilise knowledge the knowledge specialist translates and transforms&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this knowledge so it can be easily used and applied in practice by the people working within healthcare organisations, services and systems.&nbsp; Sometimes described as a “knowledge broker” the knowledge specialist uses their expertise to&nbsp;ensure healthcare organisations, services and systems are effective in mobilising evidence and internally generated knowledge. They also&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;healthcare staff&nbsp;can:&nbsp;</p>

           <li>Continue to learn&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Drive innovation </li>
          </ul>

          <p>They do this by:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Connecting people to people&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to knowledge and&nbsp;the evidence base&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to good practice</li>

          <p>We know that the decommissioning of HDAS in March 2022 represents one of the biggest changes for NHS knowledge and library services for some years. To understand how best to help colleagues move to using provider interfaces for database searches, HEE funded a six-month pilot to work with library teams to identify what training, support and technologies will help with the transition.</p>

          <p>The pilot project was coordinated on behalf of HEE by Emily Hurt and Vicky Price, who worked very closely with leaders of each pilot group.</p>

          <h2><strong>Who was involved in the pilot?</strong></h2>

          <p>A total of 32 library services from the East Midlands, East of England, Greater Manchester and Kent, Surrey and Sussex took part in the pilot. Across these services, 98 expert searchers switched from using HDAS to provider interfaces.<br />
          Pilot participants were offered:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Training on the use of provider interfaces. Platform-specific training was delivered by the providers, and also librarians from the University of Cambridge delivered sessions based on their experience of using provider interfaces.</li>
           <li>Access to reference management software, including funded access to EndNote and RefWorks as well as free-to-use products (Zotero and Mendeley).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Participants were asked to complete:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>A baseline demographic survey</li>
           <li>Pre- and post-switch search experience questionnaires</li>
           <li>Training evaluations</li>
           <li>A reference management software evaluation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Towards the end of the pilot period, all participants were invited to take part in a series of After Action Reviews and knowledge sharing sessions.</p>

          <h2>Key findings</h2>

          <p>Many pilot participants had concerns about changing their practice, learning new ways of working and the possible impact on productivity and/or the quality of search outputs. Equally, many perceived benefits, including developing new skills, using reference management software and using the additional features of provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>Most pilot participants conducted between one and three searches per week.</p>

          <p>The average pre-switch time spent completing searches using HDAS was 3 hours 9 minutes. This increased to 3 hours 18 minutes when searchers switched to the provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>The librarian-led training delivered by the University of Cambridge was very well received. We learned that provider-led training needs to be better tailored to the needs of NHS searchers.</p>

          <p>Peer support and collaborative working proved invaluable. Sharing knowledge and experience was an important element of each pilot group.</p>

          <p>Provision of a single point of contact for user support will continue to be critical, and going forwards, service support clearly needs to be extended to include provider interfaces and reference management software.</p>

          <p>Pilot participants reported unexpected variation in their experience of using provider interfaces and identified the interface developments most likely to benefit NHS searchers. Reliance on HDAS has meant these needs had not previously been identified or explored.<br />
          Reference management software can definitely help with deduplicating results and formatting search outputs, but the pilot identified some practical issues which need to be addressed.</p>

          <h2>What is HEE doing next?</h2>

          <p>Taking into account all the learning from the last six months, the following actions have been identified as priorities.</p>

          <h3><strong>Training for knowledge and library service staff</strong></h3>

          <p>Database providers are being asked to offer platform-specific training tailored to the needs of searchers in the NHS, including basic and advanced searching. This will be available from July onwards.</p>

          <p>HEE is commissioning a series of librarian-led training sessions for those who carry out complex searches. These will be delivered in August and September, and again in January and February.</p>

          <h3><strong>Peer support and sharing</strong></h3>

          <p>HEE will support the sharing of good practice through signposting, blogposts, case studies and additional resources, hosted on the new KLS website.</p>

          <p>HEE will strengthen opportunities for peer support and learning through forums, network events, training and other methods.</p>

          <h3><strong>Provision for non-librarian searchers</strong></h3>

          <p>The focus of this pilot was librarians as the primary users of HDAS. We anticipate that most search needs of many end-users will be met by the new national discovery service, to be launched in autumn 2021. However, we know some end-users will still need to carry out advanced and complex searches using the provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>HEE will work with NICE to communicate with HDAS users from September, providing information about the discontinuation of the service and signposting alternatives.</p>

          <p>HEE will work with volunteers to co-produce signposting guides for end users and resources which can be used locally to train users of provider interfaces.</p>

          <h3><strong>Technical developments</strong></h3>

          <p>To help make the switch from HDAS easier, all three database providers are being asked to prioritise the following developments:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>“Title/Abstract” search field</li>
           <li>Standard ‘HDAS-like’ output format, available in Microsoft Word, PDF, Microsoft Excel and RIS as a minimum</li>
           <li>Autosave function</li>
          </ul>

          <p>HEE will also work with providers and OpenAthens to reduce the number of accounts needed across interfaces.</p>

          <p>Full text linking in provider interfaces and reference management will be improved by the introduction of EBSCO’s Full Text Finder and Third Iron’s LibKey over the coming months.</p>

          <h3><strong>Reference management software</strong></h3>

          <p>All library staff with an NHS OpenAthens account will be provided with access to RefWorks (as a second phase, we hope it will be feasible to offer access to library service users as well).</p>

          <p>RefWorks will be configured with OpenAthens authentication and enhanced full-text linking using LibKey, and an ‘HDAS-like’ output format will be implemented.</p>

          <p>Training and support for using reference management software will be provided.</p>

          <p>HEE will seek to negotiate discount pricing for those wishing to buy EndNote locally. The desktop client version of EndNote was highly regarded by pilot participants and offers advanced functionality for those doing large volumes of searches, but unfortunately cannot be made available via a web-based national subscription.</p>

          <h3><strong>Engagement with database providers</strong></h3>

          <p>With NICE, HEE has started to engage with our database providers to include more clearly defined requirements in contract monitoring processes, and to influence interface developments based on librarian feedback.</p>

          <p>When National Core Content is next reprocured, we will investigate options for reducing the number of interfaces needed to access the required range of bibliographic databases.</p>

          <h3><strong>Service desk support</strong></h3>

          <p>HEE will work with NICE and providers to develop an integrated support desk function to cover enquiries relating to database provider interfaces and RefWorks as well as the national discovery service, link resolver and OpenAthens.</p>

          <h3><strong>Communications and engagement</strong></h3>

          <p>The pilot has underlined the importance of working together to solve problems, and of timely and effective communications, to build a shared understanding. This is a time of great change for individuals and services and we want to fully engage with teams through this and other projects.</p>

          <h3><strong>Exploring new tools and technologies</strong></h3>

          <p>Separately from the pilot, we have worked with the HEE digital team to review and refine the specification of requirements for expert searchers originally created following the discovery research undertaken by Lagom Strategy. We will continue to consider which tools and technologies could potentially help those searching multiple datasets, but the actions above are the priority.</p>

          <h2>What should library teams do next?</h2>

          <p>A key recommendation from the pilot is that knowledge and library service staff new to provider interface searching should allow time over the coming months both for training and post-training practice.</p>

          <p>Over the next few weeks, look out for information about:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Training opportunities</li>
           <li>Reference management software</li>
           <li>Co-production of training resources for end-users</li>
           <li>Case studies from those who have already switched from HDAS</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>The early adopter pilot and feedback from the After Action Reviews and knowledge sharing sessions have been invaluable in informing our thinking and planning. We are very grateful to all those who participated. Particular thanks go to the group leaders Affra Al Shamsi, Heather Gardner, Paula Elliott, Steve Glover and William Henderson, as well as Isla Kuhn, Veronica Phillips, Eleanor Barker and Jo Milton at Cambridge Medical Library.</p>

          <p>All library staff with an NHS OpenAthens account will be provided with access to RefWorks (as a second phase, we hope it will be feasible to offer access to library service users as well).</p>

          <p>RefWorks will be configured with OpenAthens authentication and enhanced full-text linking using LibKey, and an ‘HDAS-like’ output format will be implemented.</p>

          <p>Training and support for using reference management software will be provided.</p>

          <p>HEE will seek to negotiate discount pricing for those wishing to buy EndNote locally. The desktop client version of EndNote was highly regarded by pilot participants and offers advanced functionality for those doing large volumes of searches, but unfortunately cannot be made available via a web-based national subscription.</p>

          <h3><strong>Engagement with database providers</strong></h3>

          <p>With NICE, HEE has started to engage with our database providers to include more clearly defined requirements in contract monitoring processes, and to influence interface developments based on librarian feedback.</p>

          <p>When National Core Content is next reprocured, we will investigate options for reducing the number of interfaces needed to access the required range of bibliographic databases.</p>

          <h3><strong>Service desk support</strong></h3>

          <p>HEE will work with NICE and providers to develop an integrated support desk function to cover enquiries relating to database provider interfaces and RefWorks as well as the national discovery service, link resolver and OpenAthens.</p>

          <h3><strong>Communications and engagement</strong></h3>

          <p>The pilot has underlined the importance of working together to solve problems, and of timely and effective communications, to build a shared understanding. This is a time of great change for individuals and services and we want to fully engage with teams through this and other projects.</p>

          <h3><strong>Exploring new tools and technologies</strong></h3>

          <p>Separately from the pilot, we have worked with the HEE digital team to review and refine the specification of requirements for expert searchers originally created following the discovery research undertaken by Lagom Strategy. We will continue to consider which tools and technologies could potentially help those searching multiple datasets, but the actions above are the priority.</p>

          <h2>What should library teams do next?</h2>

          <p>A key recommendation from the pilot is that knowledge and library service staff new to provider interface searching should allow time over the coming months both for training and post-training practice.</p>

          <p>Over the next few weeks, look out for information about:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Training opportunities</li>
           <li>Reference management software</li>
           <li>Co-production of training resources for end-users</li>
           <li>Case studies from those who have already switched from HDAS</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>The early adopter pilot and feedback from the After Action Reviews and knowledge sharing sessions have been invaluable in informing our thinking and planning. We are very grateful to all those who participated. Particular thanks go to the group leaders Affra Al Shamsi, Heather Gardner, Paula Elliott, Steve Glover and William Henderson, as well as Isla Kuhn, Veronica Phillips, Eleanor Barker and Jo Milton at Cambridge Medical Library.</p>

        hippostd:content: |-
          <p>We know that the decommissioning of HDAS in March 2022 represents one of the biggest changes for NHS knowledge and library services for some years. To understand how best to help colleagues move to using provider interfaces for database searches, HEE funded a six-month pilot to work with library teams to identify what training, support and technologies will help with the transition.</p>

          <p>The pilot project was coordinated on behalf of HEE by Emily Hurt and Vicky Price, who worked very closely with leaders of each pilot group.</p>

          <h2><strong>Who was involved in the pilot?</strong></h2>

          <p>A total of 32 library services from the East Midlands, East of England, Greater Manchester and Kent, Surrey and Sussex took part in the pilot. Across these services, 98 expert searchers switched from using HDAS to provider interfaces.<br />
          Pilot participants were offered:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Training on the use of provider interfaces. Platform-specific training was delivered by the providers, and also librarians from the University of Cambridge delivered sessions based on their experience of using provider interfaces.</li>
           <li>Access to reference management software, including funded access to EndNote and RefWorks as well as free-to-use products (Zotero and Mendeley).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Participants were asked to complete:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>A baseline demographic survey</li>
           <li>Pre- and post-switch search experience questionnaires</li>
           <li>Training evaluations</li>
           <li>A reference management software evaluation</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Towards the end of the pilot period, all participants were invited to take part in a series of After Action Reviews and knowledge sharing sessions.</p>

          <h2>Key findings</h2>

          <p>Many pilot participants had concerns about changing their practice, learning new ways of working and the possible impact on productivity and/or the quality of search outputs. Equally, many perceived benefits, including developing new skills, using reference management software and using the additional features of provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>Most pilot participants conducted between one and three searches per week.</p>

          <p>The average pre-switch time spent completing searches using HDAS was 3 hours 9 minutes. This increased to 3 hours 18 minutes when searchers switched to the provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>The librarian-led training delivered by the University of Cambridge was very well received. We learned that provider-led training needs to be better tailored to the needs of NHS searchers.</p>

          <p>Peer support and collaborative working proved invaluable. Sharing knowledge and experience was an important element of each pilot group.</p>

          <p>Provision of a single point of contact for user support will continue to be critical, and going forwards, service support clearly needs to be extended to include provider interfaces and reference management software.</p>

          <p>Pilot participants reported unexpected variation in their experience of using provider interfaces and identified the interface developments most likely to benefit NHS searchers. Reliance on HDAS has meant these needs had not previously been identified or explored.<br />
          Reference management software can definitely help with deduplicating results and formatting search outputs, but the pilot identified some practical issues which need to be addressed.</p>

          <h2>What is HEE doing next?</h2>

          <p>Taking into account all the learning from the last six months, the following actions have been identified as priorities.</p>

          <h3><strong>Training for knowledge and library service staff</strong></h3>

          <p>Database providers are being asked to offer platform-specific training tailored to the needs of searchers in the NHS, including basic and advanced searching. This will be available from July onwards.</p>

          <p>HEE is commissioning a series of librarian-led training sessions for those who carry out complex searches. These will be delivered in August and September, and again in January and February.</p>

          <h3><strong>Peer support and sharing</strong></h3>

          <p>HEE will support the sharing of good practice through signposting, blogposts, case studies and additional resources, hosted on the new KLS website.</p>

          <p>HEE will strengthen opportunities for peer support and learning through forums, network events, training and other methods.</p>

          <h3><strong>Provision for non-librarian searchers</strong></h3>

          <p>The focus of this pilot was librarians as the primary users of HDAS. We anticipate that most search needs of many end-users will be met by the new national discovery service, to be launched in autumn 2021. However, we know some end-users will still need to carry out advanced and complex searches using the provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>HEE will work with NICE to communicate with HDAS users from September, providing information about the discontinuation of the service and signposting alternatives.</p>

          <p>HEE will work with volunteers to co-produce signposting guides for end users and resources which can be used locally to train users of provider interfaces.</p>

          <h3><strong>Technical developments</strong></h3>

          <p>To help make the switch from HDAS easier, all three database providers are being asked to prioritise the following developments:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>“Title/Abstract” search field</li>
           <li>Standard ‘HDAS-like’ output format, available in Microsoft Word, PDF, Microsoft Excel and RIS as a minimum</li>
           <li>Autosave function</li>
          </ul>

          <p>HEE will also work with providers and OpenAthens to reduce the number of accounts needed across interfaces.</p>

          <p>Full text linking in provider interfaces and reference management will be improved by the introduction of EBSCO’s Full Text Finder and Third Iron’s LibKey over the coming months.</p>

          <h3><strong>Reference management software</strong></h3>

          <p>All library staff with an NHS OpenAthens account will be provided with access to RefWorks (as a second phase, we hope it will be feasible to offer access to library service users as well).</p>

          <p>RefWorks will be configured with OpenAthens authentication and enhanced full-text linking using LibKey, and an ‘HDAS-like’ output format will be implemented.</p>

          <p>Training and support for using reference management software will be provided.</p>

          <p>HEE will seek to negotiate discount pricing for those wishing to buy EndNote locally. The desktop client version of EndNote was highly regarded by pilot participants and offers advanced functionality for those doing large volumes of searches, but unfortunately cannot be made available via a web-based national subscription.</p>

          <h3><strong>Engagement with database providers</strong></h3>

          <p>With NICE, HEE has started to engage with our database providers to include more clearly defined requirements in contract monitoring processes, and to influence interface developments based on librarian feedback.</p>

          <p>When National Core Content is next reprocured, we will investigate options for reducing the number of interfaces needed to access the required range of bibliographic databases.</p>

          <h3><strong>Service desk support</strong></h3>

          <p>HEE will work with NICE and providers to develop an integrated support desk function to cover enquiries relating to database provider interfaces and RefWorks as well as the national discovery service, link resolver and OpenAthens.</p>

          <h3><strong>Communications and engagement</strong></h3>

          <p>The pilot has underlined the importance of working together to solve problems, and of timely and effective communications, to build a shared understanding. This is a time of great change for individuals and services and we want to fully engage with teams through this and other projects.</p>

          <h3><strong>Exploring new tools and technologies</strong></h3>

          <p>Separately from the pilot, we have worked with the HEE digital team to review and refine the specification of requirements for expert searchers originally created following the discovery research undertaken by Lagom Strategy. We will continue to consider which tools and technologies could potentially help those searching multiple datasets, but the actions above are the priority.</p>

          <h2>What should library teams do next?</h2>

          <p>A key recommendation from the pilot is that knowledge and library service staff new to provider interface searching should allow time over the coming months both for training and post-training practice.</p>

          <p>Over the next few weeks, look out for information about:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Training opportunities</li>
           <li>Reference management software</li>
           <li>Co-production of training resources for end-users</li>
           <li>Case studies from those who have already switched from HDAS</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>

          <p>The early adopter pilot and feedback from the After Action Reviews and knowledge sharing sessions have been invaluable in informing our thinking and planning. We are very grateful to all those who participated. Particular thanks go to the group leaders Affra Al Shamsi, Heather Gardner, Paula Elliott, Steve Glover and William Henderson, as well as Isla Kuhn, Veronica Phillips, Eleanor Barker and Jo Milton at Cambridge Medical Library.</p>

          <p>Following on from&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="streamlining-inter-lending-and-document-supply-" target="_blank">blog post in November 2020</a>&nbsp;here’s&nbsp;an update.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In January, Health Education England&nbsp;engaged an external consultant, Ken Chad, to review&nbsp;options for streamlining&nbsp;ILDS in the NHS.&nbsp;Inter-library resource sharing in the NHS is inherently complex and we&nbsp;were keen to understand whether&nbsp;recent developments -&nbsp;the introduction of the new&nbsp;national&nbsp;discovery&nbsp;service, the planned move to regional&nbsp;library management systems (LMS)&nbsp;and emerging market solutions&nbsp;for peer-to-peer sharing&nbsp;-&nbsp;present&nbsp;opportunities to address the complexity.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ken reviewed our workflows,&nbsp;systems&nbsp;and&nbsp;networks and talked to potential commercial partners&nbsp;including the suppliers of&nbsp;RapidILL&nbsp;and Tipasa.&nbsp;&nbsp;His&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="nhs-library-resource-sharing" target="_blank">final report</a>&nbsp;includes three&nbsp;recommendations&nbsp;to HEE:&nbsp;</p>

          <ol start="1">
           <li>
           <p>To create a&nbsp;‘national holdings database’&nbsp;of journal holdings&nbsp;- effectively a single ‘union list’&nbsp;- using&nbsp;link resolver&nbsp;data&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <ol start="2">
           <li>
           <p>To&nbsp;enable interoperability between&nbsp;regional&nbsp;library management systems (LMS)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;national holdings&nbsp;database&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <ol start="3">
           <li>
           <p>To&nbsp;continue to work&nbsp;to address outstanding policy,&nbsp;technical and financial&nbsp;issues&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <p>A&nbsp;single&nbsp;national holdings database&nbsp;should make it much&nbsp;quicker&nbsp;to source potential suppliers&nbsp;of&nbsp;journal&nbsp;article&nbsp;than&nbsp;current&nbsp;arrangements allow.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;the database uses&nbsp;resolver data,&nbsp;library teams&nbsp;would no longer&nbsp;need to&nbsp;upload and maintain&nbsp;journal holdings in LMS or&nbsp;on&nbsp;separate resource-sharing platforms&nbsp;to make them&nbsp;visible to other libraries.&nbsp;The holdings database would&nbsp;ideally&nbsp;include&nbsp;some form of ‘load&nbsp;balancing’&nbsp;to ensure that requests are spread across libraries as&nbsp;fairly as&nbsp;possible.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ken's second recommendation recognises that management of ILDS requests&nbsp;typically takes place within LMS, alongside management of user records and circulation functions (though we know some NHS libraries maintain separate ILDS systems). Interoperability would streamline&nbsp;library&nbsp;workflows. Interoperability requirements are being included in the specifications for regional library management systems&nbsp;as they are procured.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ken’s&nbsp;final&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;points to the&nbsp;cost/benefit data and modelling&nbsp;needed to make a business case for investment in national ILDS streamlining.

          <p>Following on from&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="streamlining-inter-lending-and-document-supply-" target="_blank">blog post in November 2020</a>&nbsp;here’s&nbsp;an update.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In January, Health Education England&nbsp;engaged an external consultant, Ken Chad, to review&nbsp;options for streamlining&nbsp;ILDS in the NHS.&nbsp;Inter-library resource sharing in the NHS is inherently complex and we&nbsp;were keen to understand whether&nbsp;recent developments -&nbsp;the introduction of the new&nbsp;national&nbsp;discovery&nbsp;service, the planned move to regional&nbsp;library management systems (LMS)&nbsp;and emerging market solutions&nbsp;for peer-to-peer sharing&nbsp;-&nbsp;present&nbsp;opportunities to address the complexity.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ken reviewed our workflows,&nbsp;systems&nbsp;and&nbsp;networks and talked to potential commercial partners&nbsp;including the suppliers of&nbsp;RapidILL&nbsp;and Tipasa.&nbsp;&nbsp;His&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="nhs-library-resource-sharing" target="_blank">final report</a>&nbsp;includes three&nbsp;recommendations&nbsp;to HEE:&nbsp;</p>

          <ol start="1">
           <li>
           <p>To create a&nbsp;‘national holdings database’&nbsp;of journal holdings&nbsp;- effectively a single ‘union list’&nbsp;- using&nbsp;link resolver&nbsp;data&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <ol start="2">
           <li>
           <p>To&nbsp;enable interoperability between&nbsp;regional&nbsp;library management systems (LMS)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;national holdings&nbsp;database&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <ol start="3">
           <li>
           <p>To&nbsp;continue to work&nbsp;to address outstanding policy,&nbsp;technical and financial&nbsp;issues&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <p>A&nbsp;single&nbsp;national holdings database&nbsp;should make it much&nbsp;quicker&nbsp;to source potential suppliers&nbsp;of&nbsp;journal&nbsp;article&nbsp;than&nbsp;current&nbsp;arrangements allow.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;the database uses&nbsp;resolver data,&nbsp;library teams&nbsp;would no longer&nbsp;need to&nbsp;upload and maintain&nbsp;journal holdings in LMS or&nbsp;on&nbsp;separate resource-sharing platforms&nbsp;to make them&nbsp;visible to other libraries.&nbsp;The holdings database would&nbsp;ideally&nbsp;include&nbsp;some form of ‘load&nbsp;balancing’&nbsp;to ensure that requests are spread across libraries as&nbsp;fairly as&nbsp;possible.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ken's second recommendation recognises that management of ILDS requests&nbsp;typically takes place within LMS, alongside management of user records and circulation functions (though we know some NHS libraries maintain separate ILDS systems). Interoperability would streamline&nbsp;library&nbsp;workflows. Interoperability requirements are being included in the specifications for regional library management systems&nbsp;as they are procured.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ken’s&nbsp;final&nbsp;recommendation&nbsp;points to the&nbsp;cost/benefit data and modelling&nbsp;needed to make a business case for investment in national ILDS streamlining. We are very aware that the growth in open access publishing will&nbsp;change the ILDS landscape, potentially weakening the case for a&nbsp;solution&nbsp;designed to optimise&nbsp;sharing&nbsp;of resources the NHS&nbsp;has paid&nbsp;or is paying to access.

          <p>In the NHS LKS&nbsp;community&nbsp;we&nbsp;have been pondering for years,&nbsp;if not decades,&nbsp;how we might streamline inter-lending and document supply&nbsp;processes, in order to:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>make it quicker and&nbsp;easier for LKS staff to manage requests&nbsp;and&nbsp;source&nbsp;suppliers</li>
           <li>make it quicker and&nbsp;easier&nbsp;and for end users to&nbsp;place and receive&nbsp;their&nbsp;requests</li>
           <li>optimise&nbsp;use of NHS-&nbsp;purchased content&nbsp;and reduce the risk of paying&nbsp;external sources&nbsp;for articles which are in fact available within the NHS</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In recent years,&nbsp;reciprocal inter-lending and document supply&nbsp;has extended&nbsp;to cover the whole of England. The&nbsp;<a href="inter-lending-and-document-supply">INC scheme</a>&nbsp;is a great example of working collaboratively&nbsp;across the country.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;underpinning systems haven’t&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;kept&nbsp;up.&nbsp;ILL staff have developed smart ways of working, but it can&nbsp;still&nbsp;be&nbsp;unnecessarily time-consuming&nbsp;to check different catalogues,&nbsp;copy and paste&nbsp;data from one system to another,&nbsp;or&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;holdings&nbsp;data&nbsp;and library user information&nbsp;in&nbsp;more than one place.&nbsp;The need to ensure compliance with copyright and data protection legislation adds to the complexity.&nbsp;The mechanics of requesting&nbsp;items&nbsp;are&nbsp;also&nbsp;different for&nbsp;end users&nbsp;across the country.</p>

          <p>The arrival of&nbsp;the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Discovery&nbsp;Service&nbsp;and the&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;migrate&nbsp;towards fewer, regional&nbsp;library management systems&nbsp;presents an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;review&nbsp;document requesting and supply&nbsp;workflows and consider what improvements&nbsp;may&nbsp;be made.&nbsp;Library services which have implemented local discovery systems&nbsp;report&nbsp;that this can increase demand for inter-lending and document supply services. We&nbsp;need sourcing and supply processes to be as efficient as possible&nbsp;to meet the demand and extend the reach of our services.</p>

          <p>So, as the National Discovery Service and library management system work progresses, we will work with system suppliers and library staff to explore opportunities. Please look out for future requests for input from library staff willing to help us with considering workflows and test solutions. More news to follow in due course.</p>

          <p>See more information on the&nbsp;<a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/national-discovery-service">National Discovery Service</a>.</p>

The&nbsp;<a href="inter-lending-and-document-supply">INC scheme</a>&nbsp;is a great example of working collaboratively&nbsp;across the country.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;underpinning systems haven’t&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;kept&nbsp;up.&nbsp;ILL staff have developed smart ways of working, but it can&nbsp;still&nbsp;be&nbsp;unnecessarily time-consuming&nbsp;to check different catalogues,&nbsp;copy and paste&nbsp;data from one system to another,&nbsp;or&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;holdings&nbsp;data&nbsp;and library user information&nbsp;in&nbsp;more than one place.&nbsp;The need to ensure compliance with copyright and data protection legislation adds to the complexity.&nbsp;The mechanics of requesting&nbsp;items&nbsp;are&nbsp;also&nbsp;different for&nbsp;end users&nbsp;across the country.</p>

          <p>The arrival of&nbsp;the&nbsp;National&nbsp;Discovery&nbsp;Service&nbsp;and the&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;migrate&nbsp;towards fewer, regional&nbsp;library management systems&nbsp;presents an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;review&nbsp;document requesting and supply&nbsp;workflows and consider what improvements&nbsp;may&nbsp;be made.&nbsp;Library services which have implemented local discovery systems&nbsp;report&nbsp;that this can increase demand for inter-lending and document supply services. We&nbsp;need sourcing and supply processes to be as efficient as possible&nbsp;to meet the demand and extend the reach of our services.</p>

          <p>So, as the National Discovery Service and library management system work progresses, we will work with system suppliers and library staff to explore opportunities. Please look out for future requests for input from library staff willing to help us with considering workflows and test solutions. More news to follow in due course.</p>

          <p>In the NHS LKS&nbsp;community&nbsp;we&nbsp;have been pondering for years,&nbsp;if not decades,&nbsp;how we might streamline inter-lending and document supply&nbsp;processes, in order to:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>make it quicker and&nbsp;easier for LKS staff to manage requests&nbsp;and&nbsp;source&nbsp;suppliers</li>
           <li>make it quicker and&nbsp;easier&nbsp;and for end users to&nbsp;place and receive&nbsp;their&nbsp;requests</li>
           <li>optimise&nbsp;use of NHS-&nbsp;purchased content&nbsp;and reduce the risk of paying&nbsp;external sources&nbsp;for articles which are in fact available within the NHS</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You’re thinking “What? More acronyms?”</p>

          <p>Don’t worry, all is explained. The <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/planning-guid-16-17-20-21.pdf">NHS Five Year Forward View Shared Planning Guidance</a> required every local health and care system in England to create a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/futurenhs/deliver-forward-view/stp/">Sustainability and Transformation Plan</a> (STP). These will be place-based, multi-year plans built around the needs of local populations. STPs will drive transformation in health and care outcomes between 2016 and 2021.</p>

          <p>To deliver these plans, NHS providers, CCGs, Local Authorities, and other health and care services have come together to form 44 STP ‘footprints’ (<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stp-footprints-march-2016.pdf">maps</a>). The majority of STP <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/03/leaders-confirmed/">Chairs</a> have been appointed. Local Workforce Action Boards will be responsible for delivering four key pieces of work in the coming months including an action plan that proposes the necessary investment in workforce required to support delivery, and identifying sources of funds to enable its implementation.</p>

          <p>Time is of the essence. STPs are working to a deadline of 30 June for submission of their full plans but before submitting the plans will have to go through local governance approval processes e.g. a health and wellbeing board or a Trust board.&nbsp; This means the deadline for creating the plans is looking more like early June.</p>

          <p>The 10 big questions for STPs are:-</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How are you going to prevent ill health and moderate demand for healthcare?</li>
           <li>How are you engaging patients, communities and NHS staff?</li>
           <li>How will you support, invest in and improve general practice?</li>
           <li>How will you implement new care models that address local challenges?</li>
           <li>How will you achieve and maintain performance against core standards?</li>
           <li>How will you achieve our 2020 ambitions on key clinical priorities?</li>
           <li>How will you improve quality and safety?</li>
           <li>How will you deploy technology to accelerate change?</li>
           <li>How will you develop the workforce you need to deliver?</li>
           <li><a href="http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/finance-and-efficiency/mapped-the-financial-health-of-every-stp-area/7004214.article">How will you achieve and maintain financial balance</a>?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For more detail see <a href="stp-briefing.odt_1">The Big Question briefing</a>.</p>

          <p>The Big Question for Library and Knowledge Services to ask is “How can we help?”</p>

          <ul>
           <li>What evidence, best practice and data is required by the STP?</li>
           <li>Where do you need to focus to best support the health and care system?</li>
           <li>How can we work together with neighbouring library and knowledge services to provide the best support, efficiently and effectively?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Sometimes several library services serve the organisations within a footprint. Some services span more than one STP. So, it’s important to discuss how to work and collaborate more closely to make Library and Knowledge Services an essential resource for the STPs.</p>

          <p>The clock is ticking.&nbsp; For colleagues just getting started this <a href="lks-hee-stps-may-2016.pdf">presentation</a>, <a href="stp-briefing.odt">briefing</a> and <a href="stp-action-planning-grid.odt">action planning grid</a>, from a recent workshop in Cambridge is shared, simply as an introductory resource. We see that to make a difference, Library and Knowledge services need to act fast, making contact to offer and provide support to the STPs before plans are finalised.</p>

          <p>You’re thinking “What? More acronyms?”</p>

          <p>Don’t worry, all is explained. The <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/planning-guid-16-17-20-21.pdf">NHS Five Year Forward View Shared Planning Guidance</a> required every local health and care system in England to create a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/futurenhs/deliver-forward-view/stp/">Sustainability and Transformation Plan</a> (STP). These will be place-based, multi-year plans built around the needs of local populations. STPs will drive transformation in health and care outcomes between 2016 and 2021.</p>

          <p>To deliver these plans, NHS providers, CCGs, Local Authorities, and other health and care services have come together to form 44 STP ‘footprints’ (<a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/stp-footprints-march-2016.pdf">maps</a>). The majority of STP <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2016/03/leaders-confirmed/">Chairs</a> have been appointed. Local Workforce Action Boards will be responsible for delivering four key pieces of work in the coming months including an action plan that proposes the necessary investment in workforce required to support delivery, and identifying sources of funds to enable its implementation.</p>

          <p>Time is of the essence. STPs are working to a deadline of 30 June for submission of their full plans but before submitting the plans will have to go through local governance approval processes e.g. a health and wellbeing board or a Trust board.&nbsp; This means the deadline for creating the plans is looking more like early June.</p>

          <p>The 10 big questions for STPs are:-</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How are you going to prevent ill health and moderate demand for healthcare?</li>
           <li>How are you engaging patients, communities and NHS staff?</li>
           <li>How will you support, invest in and improve general practice?</li>
           <li>How will you implement new care models that address local challenges?</li>
           <li>How will you achieve and maintain performance against core standards?</li>
           <li>How will you achieve our 2020 ambitions on key clinical priorities?</li>
           <li>How will you improve quality and safety?</li>
           <li>How will you deploy technology to accelerate change?</li>
           <li>How will you develop the workforce you need to deliver?</li>
           <li><a href="http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/finance-and-efficiency/mapped-the-financial-health-of-every-stp-area/7004214.article">How will you achieve and maintain financial balance</a>?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>For more detail see <a href="stp-briefing.odt_1">The Big Question briefing</a>.</p>

          <p>The Big Question for Library and Knowledge Services to ask is “How can we help?”</p>

          <ul>
           <li>What evidence, best practice and data is required by the STP?</li>
           <li>Where do you need to focus to best support the health and care system?</li>
           <li>How can we work together with neighbouring library and knowledge services to provide the best support, efficiently and effectively?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Sometimes several library services serve the organisations within a footprint. Some services span more than one STP. So, it’s important to discuss how to work and collaborate more closely to make Library and Knowledge Services an essential resource for the STPs.</p>

          <p>The clock is ticking.&nbsp; For colleagues just getting started this <a href="lks-hee-stps-may-2016.pdf">presentation</a>, <a href="stp-briefing.odt">briefing</a> and <a href="stp-action-planning-grid.odt">action planning grid</a>, from a recent workshop in Cambridge is shared, simply as an introductory resource. We see that to make a difference, Library and Knowledge services need to act fast, making contact to offer and provide support to the STPs before plans are finalised.</p>

          <p>Having read the recent blog from Imrana Ghumra and Sue Lacey Bryant on “<a href="10-big-questions-for-stps-one-big-question-for-lks">10 big questions for STPs. One big question for LKS</a>” I decided to email my trust’s lead on the local STP.</p>

          <p>Using the key themes from the 10 big questions I outlined how I felt the library could support him and the wider team. I was keen to emphasis how the library could support the team with evidence and current awareness . I ended with a section on how NHS libraries are supporting patient and public information to tie in with the STP health and wellbeing agenda.</p>

          <p>To my surprise I got a request by return email for a meeting.</p>

          <p>My next surprise was his main interest: patient and public information. He had little interest in our other key skills and offers but focussed the whole conversation on how the library could contribute to the local preventative medicine and health and wellbeing strategies.</p>

          <p>For those of us already engaged in PPI this may be another avenue to explore. The STP may enable your service to have collaboration with the wider healthcare community, the public library health offer and also have direct input into patient and public health information at a trust and local level.</p>

          <p>Further to the PPI work I am already engaged in, I have already started a conversation with the Lead on Patient Information on how we might use patient letters for health information.</p>

          <p>My experience is not an isolated one as I discovered in a conversation with Natasha Howard. Natasha said “I seem to be having more and more conversations about provision of patient and public information, and how the library team can support this work. In the last few weeks it has come up in conversations and emails with clinicians and one of the public health teams that we are contracted to provide services to. I’m due to speak to colleagues in Procurement about how we might contribute to reducing spending on print information for service users. Our accountant has also picked up on our potential in this area. Following discussion of the role of information in prevention and improving outcomes, she suggested that we could write a good business case for funding to recruit a Patient Information Librarian.”</p>

          <p><strong>Working in partnership to support the work of the Sustainability and Transformation Partnership</strong></p>

          <p>The publication of the NHS Five Year Forward View and the subsequent arrival of Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) signalled an attempt to change relationships between NHS providers and commissioners, moving away from a competitive marketplace towards closer partnership working.</p>

          <p>In the North East of England, a group of staff from NHS Library and Knowledge Services, Commissioning and Public Health are looking to do the same. The Sustainability and Transformation Evidence Mobilisation Club (or STEM Club) is an informal group of colleagues working to support the mobilisation of evidence within the healthcare system.</p>

          <p>We are trying to achieve this aim in two ways:</p>

          <p>* By making links to work streams within the North East and Cumbria Partnership (and potentially beyond)</p>

          <p>* By providing both virtual and real (in person) opportunities to connect as a group and understand who is working on what, making effective use of our collective knowledge and insights</p>

          <p>A small group of STEM members has been meeting for over a year now and we have started to make links between work stream leads and library and knowledge staff. So far, a number of LKS staff have been involved in working on number of topics including:</p>

          <p>* Frailty</p>

          <p>* Maternal choice in perinatal care</p>

          <p>* Physical exercise in preventive healthcare</p>

          <p>We held our first full meeting of the STEM Club in March 2018. We used the name Club as the group has no formal governance arrangements as such. The event was attended by staff from LKS, Public Health, Commissioning and HE. A number of members of the group are from Yorkshire and Humber and we are happy to welcome colleagues from outside the North East. We were genuinely surprised at the level of enthusiasm in the room. There was a huge amount of interest in the work that has been done so far and a shared commitment to continuing with this approach. A few key challenges and affirmations came from the day:</p>

          <p>* STEM is a “bottom-up” movement. This is genuine partnership working between colleagues with a shared interest in evidence mobilisation.</p>

          <p>* We need to be responsive to the pace of work at a system level and be able to “share as we go”.</p>

          <p>* We also need to be open to accessing and using a range of different types of evidence and knowledge (including tacit knowledge).</p>

          <p>We are thinking about how we can share more widely regionally and nationally and we would be very interested to hear from others who have been working with their STPs locally.</p>

          <p>The librarians who have been involved in the work are happy to share their experiences with you: Kirstin Himsworth County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust Claire Masterman County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust Dor Wilson Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust</p>

          <p>You may also want to contact your Regional LKS Lead to find out more about working with STPs:</p>

          <p>Health Information Week 2018 (2<sup>nd</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> July) is coming up on the horizon. Join in using this year’s hashtag #HIW2018.</p>

          <p>There are so many ways to get involved online and/or through events and other activities. &nbsp;Now is a great time to gather initial ideas on how your service might participate in this year’s campaign.</p>

          <p>To support you, some additional resources are being developed by a project team from the 2017-2018 HEE/CILIP Leadership Programme.</p>

          <p>Why not start with this <a href="hiw-ideas-postcard-a4-x2-updates.pdf">postcard</a>&nbsp;to generate some ideas among your teams, regional colleagues or other partners?</p>

          <p>Don’t forget there are many helpful tips and resources available to you – we hope to add more resources in the next few weeks.</p>

          <p>We have also created a dedicated Twitter account @Healthinfoweek that you can follow for updates.</p>

          <p>Coming soon</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Report on learning from HIW2017 including results from a recent survey and some useful case studies</li>
           <li>Marketing templates</li>
           <li>Signposting to further resources</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition, we are exploring evaluation templates and developing partnerships with other sectors to strengthen HIW as a national campaign. So, watch this space!</p>

          <p>A reflection from David Stewart</p>

          <p>“Knowledge Management (KM), what’s that then?” A question I used to dread. That “crunch” moment in the lift when a very senior person asks you a question that really takes more than 30 seconds to answer. I had never heard of knowledge management until the later 1990s; it certainly did not feature in my librarianship course in 1981, but then neither did computers!</p>

          <p>Once I heard the term, I started to try to find out more. There was a bewildering array of theoretical articles some of which promised to supercharge our workplace; others were very dismissive; “knowledge can’t be managed” I collected them together and soon had two box files full and was none the wiser. Then someone pointed me to a local academic, Dr Jim Hughes at Salford University who was lecturing in KM. Jim ran a whole series of seminars for North West NHS librarians in the early 2000s, helping us to understand where it came from and what it might be. We also worked with Dr Chris Mimnagh, a GP and commissioner who was very enthusiastic about the potential of KM. Chris now works with The Innovation Agency in the North West.</p>

          <p>Over the next fifteen years KM appeared to come and go, sometimes being treated as a “nice to have” and not a priority in financially constrained times. Nevertheless, it became an important strand as we wrote and published <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Knowledge_for_healthcare_a_development_framework_2014.pdf" target="_blank">Knowledge for Healthcare</a> in December 2014. The Mobilising Evidence and Knowledge workstream has been our programme for bringing Knowledge Management to the centre of our offer into the healthcare system. This firmly twins our long-established role in disseminating and providing access to evidence from research and practice with a corporate responsibility to better manage and use knowledge and shared learning.</p>

          <h2>Knowledge for Healthcare</h2>

          <p>Five years on, and reviewing what we have achieved, I believe we have moved significantly on the KM front. Almost all NHS library and knowledge services (note that we now refer to <em>knowledge</em> services&nbsp; as an integral part of our function) have been able to demonstrate, via their Library Quality Assurance Framework (LQAF) returns, that they are actively involved in some aspect of KM within their trust. We have recently published a new edition of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="nhs-knowledge-mobilisation-framework" target="_blank">KM Framework</a> postcards describing learning before, during and after techniques; more and more of us can run a knowledge café and understand what the goldfish bowl technique is. More NHS organisations are using the Health Education England <a href="evidence-and-knowledge-self-assessment">self-assessment tool </a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/knowledge-management/evidence-and-knowledge-self-assessment-tool/index.html" target="_blank">t</a>o assess how well they are using evidence and organisational knowledge, working with health library and knowledge specialists to prioritise KM activities.&nbsp; We are about to initiate market research on potential demand for an e-qualification in KM for NHS staff.</p>

          <h2>KM Framework self-assessment tool</h2>

          <p>I believe we are in a very different KM space than even five years ago. Listen to my recent webinar on the background and context of <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/quality-and-improvement-framework/quality-and-improvement-outcomes-framework-videos-and-webinars">Quality and Improvement Outcome Four of the new Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework</a> where I say that KM “will become the every-day core of what we do” – delivering Knowledge and Library Services to ensure that organisational knowledge and best evidence are mobilised to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.</p>

That “crunch” moment in the lift when a very senior person asks you a question that really takes more than 30 seconds to answer. I had never heard of knowledge management until the later 1990s; it certainly did not feature in my librarianship course in 1981, but then neither did computers!</p>

          <p>Once I heard the term, I started to try to find out more. There was a bewildering array of theoretical articles some of which promised to supercharge our workplace; others were very dismissive; “knowledge can’t be managed” I collected them together and soon had two box files full and was none the wiser. Then someone pointed me to a local academic, Dr Jim Hughes at Salford University who was lecturing in KM. Jim ran a whole series of seminars for North West NHS librarians in the early 2000s, helping us to understand where it came from and what it might be. We also worked with Dr Chris Mimnagh, a GP and commissioner who was very enthusiastic about the potential of KM. Chris now works with The Innovation Agency in the North West.</p>

          <p>Over the next fifteen years KM appeared to come and go, sometimes being treated as a “nice to have” and not a priority in financially constrained times. Nevertheless, it became an important strand as we wrote and published <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Knowledge_for_healthcare_a_development_framework_2014.pdf" target="_blank">Knowledge for Healthcare</a> in December 2014. The Mobilising Evidence and Knowledge workstream has been our programme for bringing Knowledge Management to the centre of our offer into the healthcare system. This firmly twins our long-established role in disseminating and providing access to evidence from research and practice with a corporate responsibility to better manage and use knowledge and shared learning.</p>

          <h2>Knowledge for Healthcare</h2>

          <p>Five years on, and reviewing what we have achieved, I believe we have moved significantly on the KM front. Almost all NHS library and knowledge services (note that we now refer to <em>knowledge</em> services&nbsp; as an integral part of our function) have been able to demonstrate, via their Library Quality Assurance Framework (LQAF) returns, that they are actively involved in some aspect of KM within their trust. We have recently published a new edition of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="nhs-knowledge-mobilisation-framework" target="_blank">KM Framework</a> postcards describing learning before, during and after techniques; more and more of us can run a knowledge café and understand what the goldfish bowl technique is. More NHS organisations are using the Health Education England <a href="evidence-and-knowledge-self-assessment">self-assessment tool </a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/knowledge-management/evidence-and-knowledge-self-assessment-tool/index.html" target="_blank">t</a>o assess how well they are using evidence and organisational knowledge, working with health library and knowledge specialists to prioritise KM activities.&nbsp; We are about to initiate market research on potential demand for an e-qualification in KM for NHS staff.</p>

          <h2>KM Framework self-assessment tool</h2>

          <p>I believe we are in a very different KM space than even five years ago. Listen to my recent webinar on the background and context of <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/quality-and-improvement-framework/quality-and-improvement-outcomes-framework-videos-and-webinars">Quality and Improvement Outcome Four of the new Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework</a> where I say that KM “will become the every-day core of what we do” – delivering Knowledge and Library Services to ensure that organisational knowledge and best evidence are mobilised to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.</p>

          <p>On the 19<sup>th</sup> May CILIP held an online conference event exploring the role of knowledge management during a time of disruption and crisis, such as the pandemic of Covid-19 that we are currently living through.</p>

          <p>During June and July 2020, HEE’s Resource Discovery team conducted a series of 10 ‘Before Action Review’ engagement sessions with Library Managers about the new National Discovery Service. Over 70 individuals from across the country participated in the workshops. This blogpost provides a short summary of what participants told us.</p>

          <p>First, we asked what your users’ most common frustrations are when accessing trusted information. You told us that users find there are too many routes to information, compounded by a lack of time and skills required to sift through search results to find what they want. You also reported users’ frustrations with OpenAthens, particularly the multiple sign-ins users must use, along with expectations around access that fail to be met. One manger spoke for most, saying:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">“Users do not want to go to 25 places. They want something that works. They do not want to be trained how to use all this – they want to sit down and get what they need.”</p>

          <p>We asked what a National Discovery Service would look like to you, in an ideal world. What would it need to do?</p>

          <p>Unsurprisingly, you told us that it needs to overcome the frustrations of the current user experience. The service needs to be “seamless”, offering users a consistent experience as they move across different organisations: users “should not have to start all over again” when they move between one job or placement and the next. You want a system with the semantic search functionality of Google but not one reproducing Google’s “information hose” – one that provides trusted information, along with features such as learning from user preferences, tailoring searches to users’ interests and doing away with multiple sign-ins.</p>

          <p>We asked what lessons we could learn from your experience of managing or participating in successful projects elsewhere. You told us that managing the supplier relationship is crucial. Suppliers should provide timely and flexible project support and technical input. They must be held to account to ensure they deliver on their specifications. You also advised those leading the project to take steps to ensure that the beneficiaries of the project feel they are being consulted and kept informed.</p>

          <p>We asked you to imagine the failure of the National Discovery Service, to get us thinking about how to avoid such an outcome. Two themes especially came back to us, loud and clear. First, the project will fail if we don’t take account of the particularities of local IT systems. The second theme was failure to gain library staff support for the project. To do this, you told us we need to generate enthusiasm about its benefits. Above all else, you told us that we need to reassure staff that the implementation of the National Discovery Service is not about cutting library staff roles or investment in library services. We can reassure you it isn’t – it is about freeing up library staff time for customer facing work and reducing time and money spent maintaining local systems.</p>

          <p>Finally, we asked you what we needed to do next. You outlined a range of good project and communication principles we need to adopt. We need to ensure good project management support and supplier relationship management. We need transparent communications and regular updates, not just informing but engaging, and we need to make sure local teams are fully involved.</p>

          <p>This is just a summary of the issues you raised during the engagement sessions. We have compiled a list of <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/national-discovery-service">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to address the issues you raised during the sessions in more detail and will add to this as the procurement and implementation progresses. In the meantime, we still welcome any further comments or questions about National Discovery Service you still might have. Please send them through to us on:</p>

          <p>During June and July 2020, HEE’s Resource Discovery team conducted a series of 10 ‘Before Action Review’ engagement sessions with Library Managers about the new National Discovery Service. Over 70 individuals from across the country participated in the workshops. This blogpost provides a short summary of what participants told us.</p>

          <p>First, we asked what your users’ most common frustrations are when accessing trusted information. You told us that users find there are too many routes to information, compounded by a lack of time and skills required to sift through search results to find what they want. You also reported users’ frustrations with OpenAthens, particularly the multiple sign-ins users must use, along with expectations around access that fail to be met. One manger spoke for most, saying:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">“Users do not want to go to 25 places. They want something that works. They do not want to be trained how to use all this – they want to sit down and get what they need.”</p>

          <p>We asked what a National Discovery Service would look like to you, in an ideal world. What would it need to do?</p>

          <p>Unsurprisingly, you told us that it needs to overcome the frustrations of the current user experience. The service needs to be “seamless”, offering users a consistent experience as they move across different organisations: users “should not have to start all over again” when they move between one job or placement and the next. You want a system with the semantic search functionality of Google but not one reproducing Google’s “information hose” – one that provides trusted information, along with features such as learning from user preferences, tailoring searches to users’ interests and doing away with multiple sign-ins.</p>

          <p>We asked what lessons we could learn from your experience of managing or participating in successful projects elsewhere. You told us that managing the supplier relationship is crucial. Suppliers should provide timely and flexible project support and technical input. They must be held to account to ensure they deliver on their specifications. You also advised those leading the project to take steps to ensure that the beneficiaries of the project feel they are being consulted and kept informed.</p>

          <p>We asked you to imagine the failure of the National Discovery Service, to get us thinking about how to avoid such an outcome. Two themes especially came back to us, loud and clear. First, the project will fail if we don’t take account of the particularities of local IT systems. The second theme was failure to gain library staff support for the project. To do this, you told us we need to generate enthusiasm about its benefits. Above all else, you told us that we need to reassure staff that the implementation of the National Discovery Service is not about cutting library staff roles or investment in library services. We can reassure you it isn’t – it is about freeing up library staff time for customer facing work and reducing time and money spent maintaining local systems.</p>

          <p>Finally, we asked you what we needed to do next. You outlined a range of good project and communication principles we need to adopt. We need to ensure good project management support and supplier relationship management. We need transparent communications and regular updates, not just informing but engaging, and we need to make sure local teams are fully involved.</p>

          <p>This is just a summary of the issues you raised during the engagement sessions. We have compiled a list of <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/national-discovery-service">Frequently Asked Questions</a> to address the issues you raised during the sessions in more detail and will add to this as the procurement and implementation progresses. In the meantime, we still welcome any further comments or questions about National Discovery Service you still might have. Please send them through to us on:</p>

          <p>The new Level 3 <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/Apprenticeship/Standard/395">Library, Information and Archive Services Assistant</a> (LIAS) apprenticeship was approved for delivery in December 2018.</p>

          <p>The standard covers a wide range of professional skills and defines the activities of a LIAS Level 3 apprentice as:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“LIAS Assistants help users find the information and resources they need in order to resolve their specific query. They work with people from all parts of society and the workforce, providing essential digital and analogue information services – issuing and returning materials, organizing collections, answering research and information queries, improving customers’ literacy skills, – quite often at the forefront of innovation.”</em></p>

          <p>Within NHS libraries there are a couple of apprentices enrolled on the LIAS apprenticeship already and a few more are due to start soon. It is expected that there will be further LKS apprenticeships, either a level 6 or level 7 (equivalent to a Masters degree) in due course.</p>

          <p>As we know in the UK 97% of the library profession identifies as white. Being a mostly postgraduate entry profession presents significant barriers to entry. Apprenticeships are a key route to diversification of the workforce, providing another alternative route to qualification alongside <a href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/page/ProfessionalRegistrationCertification">CILIP Professional Registration Certification</a>. In addition, because of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy/apprenticeship-levy">Apprenticeship Levy</a> enrolling staff on apprenticeships is a great way to allow Trusts to recoup funding.</p>

          <p>Currently there is only one national provider for the LIAS apprenticeship, <a href="https://www.letmeplay.co.uk/alternative-education/">LMP</a>. Procurement has been completed via Health Education England so it will be straightforward for LKS Managers to procure apprenticeships locally in collaboration with their Trust’s apprenticeship leads.</p>

          <p>From our perspective in North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) Library &amp; Knowledge Service, we were thrilled to welcome our first LIAS Apprentice, Nicholas Ashton in June 2020. With previous experience in sales, Nicholas understands the importance of providing great customer service and being a team player. We are all looking forward to working with Nicholas and supporting him to complete his apprenticeship.</p>

          <p>As our main service point is still closed due to the pandemic Nicholas has mostly been working “agile” (AKA working from home) since he joined us. Members of the LKS team have taken it in turns to meet Nicholas in the Library 1-2 days a week to provide supervision and some (physically distant) face to face contact.</p>

          <p>Apprentices are required to do 20% or 1 day a week<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/831593/OTJT_Flowchart_v2_-_12092019_Final.pdf"> of-on-the-job training</a> away from their normal working duties. Off-the-job training can take many forms, the main requirement is that it supports the development of new knowledge, skills and behaviours relevant to the qualification.&nbsp; So far Nicholas’s Tutor has set him tasks to complete during his off-the-job training.&nbsp; In future I will use our contacts within the trust to provide him with opportunities to shadow colleagues in other Teams and Departments as well as setting up visits to other library and archive services.</p>

          <p>At NELFT apprenticeships are also available to staff currently in post. A previous member of the Team, Clinical Librarian Lisa Burscheidt,&nbsp; completed the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/Apprenticeship/Standard/105">Level 3 Team Leader / Supervisor</a> apprenticeship. It was sometimes challenging to release a key member of the Team 1 day a week for off-the-job training. However, in this case nature of the qualification provided an opportunity for me to delegate some of my responsibilities, including supervision of another member of the team, to make up the off-the-job training requirement. Lisa found the apprenticeship very interesting and useful. As a manager I was very aware of Lisa’s development during the programme and how this contributed positively to the functioning of the team as whole.</p>

          <p>So Nicholas is actually our third apprentice! Our first, Alice Cleaver, completed the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/Apprenticeship/Framework/490-2-1/business-and-administration-business-and-administration">Level 3 Business and Administration</a> apprenticeship last year. We were able to promote Alice to Library Assistant on completion of her qualification. You can read more about Alice’s experience at NELFT <a href="https://www.nelft.nhs.uk/nelft-talks/alice-cleaver-opens-up-about-her-apprenticeship-at-nelft-3220/">here</a>.</p>

          <p>If you would like to be persuaded to recruit a LIAS apprentice or to talk about enrolling current team members on an apprenticeship do get in touch.</p>

          <p>The new Level 3 <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/Apprenticeship/Standard/395">Library, Information and Archive Services Assistant</a> (LIAS) apprenticeship was approved for delivery in December 2018.</p>

          <p>The standard covers a wide range of professional skills and defines the activities of a LIAS Level 3 apprentice as:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“LIAS Assistants help users find the information and resources they need in order to resolve their specific query. They work with people from all parts of society and the workforce, providing essential digital and analogue information services – issuing and returning materials, organizing collections, answering research and information queries, improving customers’ literacy skills, – quite often at the forefront of innovation.”</em></p>

          <p>Within NHS libraries there are a couple of apprentices enrolled on the LIAS apprenticeship already and a few more are due to start soon. It is expected that there will be further LKS apprenticeships, either a level 6 or level 7 (equivalent to a Masters degree) in due course.</p>

          <p>As we know in the UK 97% of the library profession identifies as white. Being a mostly postgraduate entry profession presents significant barriers to entry. Apprenticeships are a key route to diversification of the workforce, providing another alternative route to qualification alongside <a href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/page/ProfessionalRegistrationCertification">CILIP Professional Registration Certification</a>. In addition, because of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apprenticeship-levy/apprenticeship-levy">Apprenticeship Levy</a> enrolling staff on apprenticeships is a great way to allow Trusts to recoup funding.</p>

          <p>Currently there is only one national provider for the LIAS apprenticeship, <a href="https://www.letmeplay.co.uk/alternative-education/">LMP</a>. Procurement has been completed via Health Education England so it will be straightforward for LKS Managers to procure apprenticeships locally in collaboration with their Trust’s apprenticeship leads.</p>

          <p>From our perspective in North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT) Library &amp; Knowledge Service, we were thrilled to welcome our first LIAS Apprentice, Nicholas Ashton in June 2020. With previous experience in sales, Nicholas understands the importance of providing great customer service and being a team player. We are all looking forward to working with Nicholas and supporting him to complete his apprenticeship.</p>

          <p>As our main service point is still closed due to the pandemic Nicholas has mostly been working “agile” (AKA working from home) since he joined us. Members of the LKS team have taken it in turns to meet Nicholas in the Library 1-2 days a week to provide supervision and some (physically distant) face to face contact.</p>

          <p>Apprentices are required to do 20% or 1 day a week<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/831593/OTJT_Flowchart_v2_-_12092019_Final.pdf"> of-on-the-job training</a> away from their normal working duties. Off-the-job training can take many forms, the main requirement is that it supports the development of new knowledge, skills and behaviours relevant to the qualification.&nbsp; So far Nicholas’s Tutor has set him tasks to complete during his off-the-job training.&nbsp; In future I will use our contacts within the trust to provide him with opportunities to shadow colleagues in other Teams and Departments as well as setting up visits to other library and archive services.</p>

          <p>At NELFT apprenticeships are also available to staff currently in post. A previous member of the Team, Clinical Librarian Lisa Burscheidt,&nbsp; completed the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/Apprenticeship/Standard/105">Level 3 Team Leader / Supervisor</a> apprenticeship. It was sometimes challenging to release a key member of the Team 1 day a week for off-the-job training. However, in this case nature of the qualification provided an opportunity for me to delegate some of my responsibilities, including supervision of another member of the team, to make up the off-the-job training requirement. Lisa found the apprenticeship very interesting and useful. As a manager I was very aware of Lisa’s development during the programme and how this contributed positively to the functioning of the team as whole.</p>

          <p>So Nicholas is actually our third apprentice! Our first, Alice Cleaver, completed the <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/Apprenticeship/Framework/490-2-1/business-and-administration-business-and-administration">Level 3 Business and Administration</a> apprenticeship last year. We were able to promote Alice to Library Assistant on completion of her qualification. You can read more about Alice’s experience at NELFT <a href="https://www.nelft.nhs.uk/nelft-talks/alice-cleaver-opens-up-about-her-apprenticeship-at-nelft-3220/">here</a>.</p>

          <p>If you would like to be persuaded to recruit a LIAS apprentice or to talk about enrolling current team members on an apprenticeship do get in touch.</p>

          <p>What do we mean by place? There is much talk across health and social care about the future being “place-based” and it is not always easy to grasp what this is all about.</p>

          <h3><strong>Here is </strong><strong>an</strong><strong> introduction to get you going:</strong></h3>

          <h3><strong>Place-based </strong></h3>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><strong>“</strong><em>A simple proposition lies at the heart of place-based care: that we blur institutional boundaries across a location to provide integrated care for individuals, families and communities. Energy, money and power shifts from institutions to citizens and communities. Devolution becomes an enabler for a reform programme that starts to deliver on the long-held promise of joining up health and social care for a population in a place, with the ultimate aim to improve the public’s health and reduce health inequalities</em>.”(1)</p>

          <p>There is added value in:</p>

          <ul>
           <li style="list-style-type:none">
           <ul>
            <li>“<em>collaborating at different levels in the system</em></li>
            <li><em>building up from places and neighbourhoods</em></li>
            <li><em>providing leadership across the system</em></li>
            <li><em>focusing on functions that are best performed at scale</em>” (2)</li>
           </ul>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The King’s Fund offer the following definitions:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>System </strong>– area covered by Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) or Integrated Care System (ICS) (<strong>size varies but they cover one to three million people</strong>)</li>
           <li><strong>Place </strong>– area covered by local authority (<strong>tend to cover populations of around 250,000 to 500,000 people</strong>)</li>
           <li><strong>Neighbourhood </strong>– smaller geography that might correspond to district council boundaries or covered by a primary care network (PCN) (<strong>tend to cover populations of around 30,000 to 50,000 people</strong>) (2)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><strong>What will this look like in practice?</strong></h2>

          <p>Groups of organisations including NHS trusts and local authorities will work together as an STP to decide on priorities for their place, and this may evolve to form an ICS and work together more formally. This will mean people with local knowledge developing the right services for their population across a whole area. It is designed to acknowledge the fact these services are not experienced in isolation by the people using them – although they are run by separate organisations, the thing they all have in common is the people from that place. It may also mean trusts agreeing that staff can work across different sites, or for some highly specialised services to be offered by one trust rather than several.</p>

          <p>National organisations such as HEE as well as NHS England and Improvement and Public Health England, have teams aligned to each STP or region. These teams will work as a link between the locally driven priorities, and nationally provided initiatives such as those to develop (in HEE’s case) the right workforce to meet the needs of each place as well as the country as a whole.</p>

          <p>As a very simple (and entirely fictitious) example, Anytown identifies that they have an aging population and rates of dementia are predicted to increase. They need staff with the right skills to meet their population’s needs, to run the right services such as specialist dementia clinics. This local intelligence can be fed into national plans by HEE to create postgraduate courses for nurses to become specialist dementia practitioners with a number of places offered to nurses from the area. The same local intelligence also identifies that many of the city’s GP workforce is rapidly approaching retirement, and they could be facing a shortage soon. An initiative could see additional placements for trainee GPs offered, to help encourage new staff to consider moving to the local area.</p>

          <p>So, it should mean greater collaboration between organisations within a particular area and ideally, seamless care for the person receiving it.</p>

          <p>What might this mean for you in your library and knowledge service as you support place-based care? ​</p>

          <p>Are there local partners who you need to work with to support and improve your offer across your STP or region?​</p>

           <li><strong>System </strong>– area covered by Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) or Integrated Care System (ICS) (<strong>size varies but they cover one to three million people</strong>)</li>
           <li><strong>Place </strong>– area covered by local authority (<strong>tend to cover populations of around 250,000 to 500,000 people</strong>)</li>
           <li><strong>Neighbourhood </strong>– smaller geography that might correspond to district council boundaries or covered by a primary care network (PCN) (<strong>tend to cover populations of around 30,000 to 50,000 people</strong>) (2)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><strong>What will this look like in practice?</strong></h2>

          <p>Groups of organisations including NHS trusts and local authorities will work together as an STP to decide on priorities for their place, and this may evolve to form an ICS and work together more formally. This will mean people with local knowledge developing the right services for their population across a whole area. It is designed to acknowledge the fact these services are not experienced in isolation by the people using them – although they are run by separate organisations, the thing they all have in common is the people from that place. It may also mean trusts agreeing that staff can work across different sites, or for some highly specialised services to be offered by one trust rather than several.</p>

          <ul>
          </ul>

          <p>National organisations such as HEE as well as NHS England and Improvement and Public Health England, have teams aligned to each STP or region. These teams will work as a link between the locally driven priorities, and nationally provided initiatives such as those to develop (in HEE’s case) the right workforce to meet the needs of each place as well as the country as a whole.</p>

          <p>As a very simple (and entirely fictitious) example, Anytown identifies that they have an aging population and rates of dementia are predicted to increase. They need staff with the right skills to meet their population’s needs, to run the right services such as specialist dementia clinics. This local intelligence can be fed into national plans by HEE to create postgraduate courses for nurses to become specialist dementia practitioners with a number of places offered to nurses from the area. The same local intelligence also identifies that many of the city’s GP workforce is rapidly approaching retirement, and they could be facing a shortage soon. An initiative could see additional placements for trainee GPs offered, to help encourage new staff to consider moving to the local area.</p>

          <p>So, it should mean greater collaboration between organisations within a particular area and ideally, seamless care for the person receiving it.</p>

          <p>What might this mean for you in your library and knowledge service as you support place-based care? ​</p>

          <p>Are there local partners who you need to work with to support and improve your offer across your STP or region?​</p>

          <p>A year on after writing our project report on ‘<a href="making-the-case-for-evidence-based-patient-information---final-report-2019.pdf">making the case for evidence-based patient information</a>’ &nbsp;the importance of evidence-based information has never been more vital. Health hasn’t been just the primary concern for health and care professionals or those individuals with health conditions, it has been the predominant topic for everybody globally.</p>

          <p>The coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has created, what has felt like, a new industry of information for us all to consume, digest and understand in order for us to go about our daily lives. From following the current guidance to implementing changes to our libraries so we can re-open safely. We also have a role in supporting others in providing accurate and updated information on various aspects of Covid-19 too, to help give trustworthy information to inform their own health decisions and even simple day to day actions such as travel and socialising</p>

          <p>The findings of our project report remain as relevant now as they did when we published it;</p>

          <p>[1] <strong>Evidence-based health information makes a positive contribution to the health care system.</strong> The last few months has been a time of uncertainty, creating a sense of fear and anxiety for many of us. It has been challenging to keep track of the various channels of communication to identify authoritative information as well as shining a light on ‘fake news’ about Covid-19. When headlines citing ways of avoiding getting Covid-19 ‘through eating garlic’ or the assumption ‘only older people are susceptible’ to this infection, it provides for a confusing and potentially dangerous information landscape. Engaging our critical appraisal skills can help give others the reassurance needed to locate the most appropriate information or evidence they can understand and feel confident in its accuracy.</p>

          <p>[2] <strong>The need for evidence-based health information is aligned with a number of high-level strategic priorities which support shared decision-making.</strong> <a href="https://healthinfoweek.wixsite.com/healthinfoweek/public-information-1">The Health information Week web site for 2020’s campaign</a> listed some useful questions to consider when looking at health information, including a number of resources that can be downloaded and adapted for local use. The new <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/public/">NHS LKS web pages</a> &nbsp;signposting members of the public to health information as well as included <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/">information and resources about Coronavirus</a>&nbsp;which are easy to understand and accessible online for patients and the public alike.</p>

          <p>[3]<strong> Library and Knowledge Services have a key role to play in influencing how health information is produced and delivered within local trusts.</strong> Since writing our report there has been a new UK-wide quality standard developed by the <a href="https://pifonline.org.uk/pif-tick/">Patient Information Forum, TICK</a> which can help us guide others in what they must do in order to provide robust and accurate patient information, one of the components being that it must be evidence based, to further make the case for this and highlight the contribution we can make.</p>

          <p>[4] <strong>Sharing learning and experience across our networks</strong> – throughout the last few months NHS Library and Knowledge Services have demonstrated the benefits of sharing resources on Covid-19. Literature searches and lists of resources have been made widely available by local services so others can tap into more tailored and topics-specific information to support health and care professionals manage the tsunami of Covid-19 related information.</p>

          <p>It would be good to hear examples of where NHS LKS have supported patients either directly or through those providing information to patients virtually during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Now that we are moving in to the next stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, your organisation may be beginning to reflect on the last three months. This period will be an important time for organisations to learn and develop based on experience and plan changes built on that new knowledge. Library and Knowledge specialists are in a unique position where we can share our expertise in capturing this knowledge for future planning and service development. Have you considered offering to support your organisation in capturing lessons learnt?</p>

          <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has seen services undertake an intense and abrupt period of change, some of these changes will now be permanent. Some alterations will be reverted, but it is likely that at least some changes will remain in place for the foreseeable future.</p>

The purpose of the guide is to help organisations make sense of the changes made in response to crisis management. Included is a grid which can help you to reflect on the changes that have occurred. What will remain in place, what needs to be reverted and which old practices have proved to be unnecessary. This is a simple and easy way to capture learning from a team and help them to see how they can plan for the future.</p>

          <p>Health Education England’s Knowledge Management Team have produced a suite of resources to support the organisation to capture their own lessons learnt.

If you are concerned about how to get different departments interested in your support consider running your own lessons learnt session or <a href="retrospective_1">retrospective review</a> with your team.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>On Friday 17<sup>th</sup> July, 76 healthcare knowledge and Library staff joined us for the Black Lives Matter in Health Libraries virtual discussion. It was led by Hong-Anh Nguyen and Natasha Howard who have previously delivered sessions on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion to the healthcare library workforce and have acted as beacons in this work.</p>

          <p>Natasha, Hong-Anh and I started to discuss ED&amp;I learning opportunities last year. We wanted to push forward open conversations and galvanise us as a workforce to take more action. It might not come as a surprise that our initial idea was to have face to face workshops across each region, but due to the pandemic we had to explore the idea of doing something virtual. Then the world watched in horror as George Floyd was murdered by the people who were supposed to protect him and the Black Lives Matter movement exploded. I, like many white people or people with privilege, was suddenly uncomfortably aware that I wasn’t doing enough. That I wasn’t being anti-racist and that I needed to take action. Fully confronting your privilege and complicity is a deeply uncomfortable but necessary process, and once you have come to accept it, it is time to get to work. Seeing how many people booked on to this session made me realise that many of us feel the same way and that taking action in our professional lives can help make the changes we so desperately want to embody.</p>

          <p>We asked the network which topics you wanted to discuss and we had some great questions. When we looked through them ahead of the event there were some clear themes emerging. These are the main questions that we worked through, although further questions and experiences were shared by participants throughout;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How can library staff, regardless of level or role, effect positive change and influence upwards where resistance is being met?</li>
           <li>What does it mean to decolonise a library in the healthcare context?</li>
           <li>How can libraries promote their EDI collections and encourage engagement with this topic through the resources they provide?</li>
           <li>What should library collections relating to EDI or BAME groups be called? What language would be most appropriate and least offensive?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>From our discussions it was clear that many of us are worried about doing or saying the wrong thing, but the clearest message I took away was to educate myself when feeling unsure. That’s why we have created a <a href="black-lives-matter_1">reading list of resources</a> for you. This covers a wide range of media (articles, books, podcasts), educational tools to work through, broad themes on the topic to more specific information on diversity in libraries. We have made the recording of the event which is available on request to members of the UK health libraries networks (email your request to the address below). Hopefully these resources will be the starting point for us in taking action in dismantling inequality in health libraries and our workforce.</p>

          <p>One of the key things I’ve learnt so far is that it is not the responsibility of our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic friends and colleagues to educate us about discrimination they may face to work, nor how our services contribute to that discrimination. Those of us with privilege can undertake that learning ourselves. I have made the commitment to being an ally through a process of lifelong learning. With that comes the understanding that I might not always get it right, but as long as we are trying then change can begin to occur. I hope you will join me.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>On Friday 17<sup>th</sup> July, 76 healthcare knowledge and Library staff joined us for the Black Lives Matter in Health Libraries virtual discussion. It was led by Hong-Anh Nguyen and Natasha Howard who have previously delivered sessions on Equality, Diversity and Inclusion to the healthcare library workforce and have acted as beacons in this work.</p>

          <p>Natasha, Hong-Anh and I started to discuss ED&amp;I learning opportunities last year. We wanted to push forward open conversations and galvanise us as a workforce to take more action. It might not come as a surprise that our initial idea was to have face to face workshops across each region, but due to the pandemic we had to explore the idea of doing something virtual. Then the world watched in horror as George Floyd was murdered by the people who were supposed to protect him and the Black Lives Matter movement exploded. I, like many white people or people with privilege, was suddenly uncomfortably aware that I wasn’t doing enough. That I wasn’t being anti-racist and that I needed to take action. Fully confronting your privilege and complicity is a deeply uncomfortable but necessary process, and once you have come to accept it, it is time to get to work. Seeing how many people booked on to this session made me realise that many of us feel the same way and that taking action in our professional lives can help make the changes we so desperately want to embody.</p>

          <p>We asked the network which topics you wanted to discuss and we had some great questions. When we looked through them ahead of the event there were some clear themes emerging. These are the main questions that we worked through, although further questions and experiences were shared by participants throughout;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How can library staff, regardless of level or role, effect positive change and influence upwards where resistance is being met?</li>
           <li>What does it mean to decolonise a library in the healthcare context?</li>
           <li>How can libraries promote their EDI collections and encourage engagement with this topic through the resources they provide?</li>
           <li>What should library collections relating to EDI or BAME groups be called? What language would be most appropriate and least offensive?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>From our discussions it was clear that many of us are worried about doing or saying the wrong thing, but the clearest message I took away was to educate myself when feeling unsure. That’s why we have created a <a href="black-lives-matter_1">reading list of resources</a> for you. This covers a wide range of media (articles, books, podcasts), educational tools to work through, broad themes on the topic to more specific information on diversity in libraries. We have made the recording of the event which is available on request to members of the UK health libraries networks (email your request to the address below). Hopefully these resources will be the starting point for us in taking action in dismantling inequality in health libraries and our workforce.</p>

          <p>One of the key things I’ve learnt so far is that it is not the responsibility of our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic friends and colleagues to educate us about discrimination they may face to work, nor how our services contribute to that discrimination. Those of us with privilege can undertake that learning ourselves. I have made the commitment to being an ally through a process of lifelong learning. With that comes the understanding that I might not always get it right, but as long as we are trying then change can begin to occur. I hope you will join me.</p>

          <p>Health Information Week 2020 (#HIW2020) finished just a month ago. It was an unusual year this year, with covid-19 having a substantial impact on what was possible during #HIW2020. Now is a good time to take stock and reflect on your local events – what went well? What would you do differently next time? How can the national team better support you? What value is there in doing #HIW2020? What impact has it had on your users and your community?</p>

          <p>Every year, the national HIW team also evaluate the week to see what could be done better next year. Your feedback is a really important part of this. For example, the new branding and website for #HIW2020 are in response to your feedback in previous years. It would be great to know what you think of the website and the branding.</p>

          <p>Based on what you’ve done locally, we also add any new ideas or advice on what’s worked well to the Ideas Bank for next year. This means that other people can benefit from sharing your ideas. We’d love to hear from you! Email your local evaluation to us as it stands.</p>

          <p>You can also email local evaluations to <a href="mailto:healthinfoweek@gmail.com">healthinfoweek@gmail.com</a></p>

          <p>We’re looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

          <p>In January 2020, in a letter to all NHS library service managers, Sue Lacey Bryant announced that Health Education England has approved an ambitious programme <em>‘to&nbsp;provide NHS staff with a single, coherent national gateway to their trusted library and knowledge service, connecting them seamlessly to quality resources, services and support tailored to their needs’.</em></p>

          <p>Sue explained that this would involve not only procuring and implementing a national discovery system. HEE is also funding an ambitious programme to deliver a more efficient and coherent infrastructure of library management systems (LMSs). The present LMS landscape in complex and costly with over 91 separate systems across England. This will be reduced to a small number of regional systems delivering improvements for library staff and end users.</p>

          <p>The transition to regional library management systems is a significant programme of work. Local LKS engagement in the selection, configuration and implementation of shared systems is critical to their success. We believe that regional LMS will deliver the optimal balance between local ownership and streamlining efficiencies.</p>

          <p>The journey has already started. HEE has been working with LKS in the South West, Thames Valley and Wessex to procure and implement a new regional LMS spanning 30 services, and with library teams in the North East to upgrade an LMS shared by 7 services. ‘After Action Review’ and ‘Retrospect’ have been used to capture lessons learned.</p>

          <p>Attention now turns to the East of England and Kent, Surrey and Sussex. These regions already benefit from HEE-funded regional LMS, but with contracts due to expire, need to prepare for re-procurement. &nbsp;‘Peer Assist’ was used to help ensure they benefit from the experience and insights of the team involved in the procurement in the South West, Thames Valley and Wessex, and Ken Chad, a very experienced library technology consultant, has been engaged to help with next steps.</p>

          <p>HEE is also supporting LKS in the West Midlands as they prepare to build on the success of locally-shared LMS to create a joined-up, scaled-up regional LMS. This is a library-led, ‘bottom up’ approach to achieving the same goals: a consolidated knowledge base of regional holdings, a consistent experience for service users across the region, and time-savings for library staff.</p>

          <p>Finally in this first phase, Senior Leadership Programme participant projects will help library teams in other parts of the country start to explore the benefits, opportunities and practicalities of shared LMS, using models of change and knowledge mobilisation tools to capture and share learning.</p>

          <p>Below Ken Chad explains a little more about the work planned with the library services in the East of England and Kent, Surrey and Sussex:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“The approach we are taking involves three pre-procurement phases: 1) communication, engagement and preparation; 2) formulating requirements 3) determining the solution to meet the requirements. </em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>We recommend communication and engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders — influencers as well as system users. Not everyone will be engaged in the same tasks, but diversity helps to bring fresh thinking and challenge assumptions. </em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Workshops with library staff will address some key questions. What are the </em><em>problems we need to solve for NHS staff and learners? What are the problems we need to solve for library staff? Why do we use LMS is the way that we do?&nbsp; Is there opportunity to standardise policies to give users a more</em> <em>consistent experience?&nbsp; Can we streamline procedures to ensure less time is spent on administration and quicker delivery times for customers?</em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>We will also be analysing the LMS market to find out the opportunities for change and what vendors can realistically offer to meet the specific needs of the NHS.”</em></p>

          <p>Happy Open Access week everybody. We’re delighted to be able to share with you the not insubstantial work that has taken place since we marked this event last year.</p>

          <h3><strong>Open Access Roundtable – partners from across the health sector come together </strong></h3>

          <p>HEE, in partnership with NIHR, hosted a very successful Open Access Roundtable on 1<sup>st</sup> October with senior stakeholders across the whole health and social care system, such as NICE, PHE, and the Local Government Association (LGA), as well as research organisations including the UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) and Health Research Authority (HRA).</p>

          <p>Initially intended to be a face to face event in London, we were delighted to still welcome 29 representatives for a rich discussion with much expertise in the virtual room. It’s clear that by working together we have a stronger negotiating position with publishers for the benefit of the NHS.</p>

          <p>Independent consultants, Information Power Ltd, helped us to plan and deliver this roundtable, gathering key quantitative and qualitative information on current publication and journal procurement practices in the NHS to share with participants to inform the discussion. This included information gleaned from two focus groups with health librarians to understand your roles and views in relation open access in addition to interviews with researchers.</p>

          <p>Open Access is a hugely complex area, but the roundtable clearly generated energy and a commitment to tackle this together; beginning with a shared strategy, and in considering an open sharing platform.</p>

          <p>We will share the full report in due course.</p>

          <h3><strong>The Open Access Community of Practice </strong></h3>

          <p>Our Open Access CoP continues to grow strong with 50 members from across the health library community in the NHS, in addition to PHE and the Kings Fund.</p>

          <p>You don’t need to a Repository Pro to join, anyone with an interest in this area is welcome to join and participate at whatever level of engagement suits them.</p>

          <p>Our Repositories Working group also launched this year, with thanks to Cate Newell, Library &amp; Knowledge Services Manager at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, for chairing this. The group is currently looking to re-run the Repositories survey so that we can update our toolkit.</p>

          <h3><strong>NHS Shared Repository Pilot with the British Library</strong></h3>

          <p>We are currently discussing an exciting project with the British Library, to pilot a shared NHS repository. To be funded by HEE, we hope to invite 5 organisations to participate in this initiative. Watch this space for more information!</p>

          <p>For more information, please contact Helene Gorring, Library &amp; Knowledge Development Manager, London, Kent, Surrey &amp; Sussex.</p>

          <p>CILIP has announced a new project to prepare the library, information and knowledge workforce for the opportunities afforded by new technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics and Process Automation. These are the technologies which are collectively shaping the ‘4th Industrial Revolution’.</p>

          <p>The aim is to undertake a landmark piece of research and deliver recommendations that will facilitate the transformation of the library and information profession into a ‘future-ready’ workforce over the next 5 years through CILIP’s Workforce Strategy.</p>

          <p>CILIP would like answers to the following question: How are machine learning, AI, robotics and process automation likely to change the roles and functions of the library, information and knowledge workforce across sectors over the next decade? Our aim is to create a report that may help answer questions like these with recommendations and issues to consider to help guide CILIP and the information and knowledge workforce.</p>

          <p>CILIP are seeking case studies to inform their research. It would be great for the Health LIS sector to be involved and represented in this endeavour.</p>

          <p>Are you, or any services you know of, currently using or working towards implementing any ‘new; and emerging technologies – such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics and Process Automation – then please share your case study using the form linked below:</p>

          <p><a href="https://fs3.formsite.com/cilip/jj46obwtwy/index.html?1598524618359">https://fs3.formsite.com/cilip/jj46obwtwy/index.html?1598524618359</a></p>

          <p>The final report will be overseen by an Editorial Group, chaired by CILIP CEO Nick Poole, and will be published in the Spring of 2021. The overall project is being Chaired by Sue Lacey Bryant, National Lead for NHS Knowledge and Library Services at Health Education England (HEE).</p>

          <p>CILIP has announced a new project to prepare the library, information and knowledge workforce for the opportunities afforded by new technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics and Process Automation. These are the technologies which are collectively shaping the ‘4th Industrial Revolution’.</p>

          <p>The aim is to undertake a landmark piece of research and deliver recommendations that will facilitate the transformation of the library and information profession into a ‘future-ready’ workforce over the next 5 years through CILIP’s Workforce Strategy.</p>

          <p>CILIP would like answers to the following question: How are machine learning, AI, robotics and process automation likely to change the roles and functions of the library, information and knowledge workforce across sectors over the next decade? Our aim is to create a report that may help answer questions like these with recommendations and issues to consider to help guide CILIP and the information and knowledge workforce.</p>

          <p>CILIP are seeking case studies to inform their research. It would be great for the Health LIS sector to be involved and represented in this endeavour.</p>

          <p>Are you, or any services you know of, currently using or working towards implementing any ‘new; and emerging technologies – such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Robotics and Process Automation – then please share your case study using the form linked below:</p>

          <p><a href="https://fs3.formsite.com/cilip/jj46obwtwy/index.html?1598524618359">https://fs3.formsite.com/cilip/jj46obwtwy/index.html?1598524618359</a></p>

          <p>The final report will be overseen by an Editorial Group, chaired by CILIP CEO Nick Poole, and will be published in the Spring of 2021. The overall project is being Chaired by Sue Lacey Bryant, National Lead for NHS Knowledge and Library Services at Health Education England (HEE).</p>

          <h3><strong>Informed, empowered and healthy digital citizens:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Health literacy, underpinned by digital literacy, for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>What is our aim?</strong></h3>

          <p>Health Education England (HEE) and the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) are working together to support citizens to develop the skills that they will need to access, assess and use health information in an increasingly digital environment.</p>

          <h3><strong>Health literacy: the issue to be addressed</strong></h3>

          <p>Health literacy is the ability to access, critically review and use health information to make informed decisions.</p>

          <p>With increasingly digital-first health services, citizens need health literacy skills underpinned by digital literacy.</p>

          <p>The levels of health literacy in England are very low. Research by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26009533/">Rowlands et al (2015)</a> shows that <strong>43% adults aged 16-65 </strong>do not understand words-based health information sufficiently well to act on it; when numbers are added, <strong>61% adults aged 16-65</strong> do not understand.</p>

          <h3><strong>How will we be working together?</strong></h3>

          <p>We are inviting key partner organisations to join us to establish a ‘sustainable, common information environment through which skilled librarians and information providers support and empower digitally and health literate citizens’.</p>

          <p>HEE is committed to a five-year initiative through which ‘health librarians will partner with a variety of information providers, supporting digital and health literacy’. We look forward to working with partners, each able to bring their expertise to the partnership and, for example, to share experience, learning and other resources.</p>

          <p>As a first step, we brought organisations together for a virtual round table on 20<sup>th</sup> August. The round table demonstrated an appetite to develop a joint programme of work, with collaboration where appropriate also on parallel activities.</p>

          <h3><strong>What will be the focus of the partnership?</strong></h3>

          <p>Information workers across sectors are ideally placed to develop the health literacy skills and underpinning digital literacy skills of citizens. Many NHS library and knowledge staff are already working locally with information workers in their local communities, such as public library staff and community pharmacists, to provide training on health literacy techniques. We will expand the sharing of tools, such as the <a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/health-literacy/">Health Literacy e-learning</a> and <a href="http://healthliteracy.geodata.uk/">geodata</a> on variation in local health literacy levels. Local partnerships will embed skills for citizens.</p>

          <p>If you have ideas for initiatives or are interested in partnership, please contact&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

Many NHS library and knowledge staff are already working locally with information workers in their local communities, such as public library staff and community pharmacists, to provide training on health literacy techniques. We will expand the sharing of tools, such as the <a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/health-literacy/">Health Literacy e-learning</a> and <a href="http://healthliteracy.geodata.uk/">geodata</a> on variation in local health literacy levels. Local partnerships will embed skills for citizens.</p>

          <p>If you have ideas for initiatives or are interested in partnership, please contact&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

          <p>As we embark on Libraries Week 2020 alongside the context of Covid-19, it is timely to reflect on how we find stability in the professionalism and expertise of our colleagues locally, regionally and nationally, and extend this to collaborating with colleagues in other sectors.</p>

          <p>Enabling the flow of quality information and evidence is not only a strategic driver underpinning all that we do (knowledge management); it is the ethos with which we take professional pride.</p>

          <h3><strong>Actualising</strong> <strong> this is our superpower!</strong></h3>

          <p>Partnership working with Somerset public libraries has allowed Somerset NHS Foundation Trust library and knowledge services to see some successes in these challenging times.</p>

          <h3>Signposting to sources of trustworthy health information for Covid-19 and beyond</h3>

          <p>Establishing a good working relationship with the Development Officer (Health and Wellbeing) for Somerset Libraries worked well this year, especially for Health Information Week in July.</p>

          <p>Previous years’ activities centered on engaging library users who physically visited the public library sites, and were promoted through a media campaign which included presence in the local press and BBC Radio Somerset. This year we had to find a different way of meeting health information needs, instead condensing activities into a coordinated social media campaign, highlighting the health information available through both services.</p>

          <p>To set the scene, we provided public library staff with the following to inform their practice:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Health Education England’s national Library and Knowledge Services team has made available the <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/">https://library.nhs.uk/</a>&nbsp;website which hosts information resources which front line staff can use to help them communicate effectively with patients, clients, and their families around Coronavirus.</li>
           <li>The resources support NHS and social care organisations fulfil their obligations under the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/accessibleinfo/">Accessible Information Standard</a> to provide information for patients, service users, carers and parents with a disability, impairment or sensory loss.</li>
           <li>HEE’s Library and Knowledge Services team identified that it is difficult to find information about COVID-19 in accessible formats and for specific patient groups. In liaison with Public Health England, NHS England/Improvement and the Patient Information Forum, they have compiled information:</li>
          </ul>

          <ul style="margin-left:40px">
           <li><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/accessible-formats-2/">Coronavirus information in Accessible Formats</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/older-people/">Coronavirus information for Older People</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/children-and-young-people/">Coronavirus information for Children and Young People</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The website includes easy read, sign language and Makaton formats as well as other communication guidance.</p>

          <p>As a result of our Health Information Week collaboration, Somerset libraries are going to build on the above by adding a section to their website giving advice for accessing health information. We are exploring the possibilities of an interactive web version of the poster or linking to our own soon to be established website.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>‘Working with the staff at Musgrove Park Hospital library has been so helpful in providing us with the expertise and knowledge to ensure we are providing the public with the best information in accessing reliable health information. In particular, their training on finding reliable health information online, has been invaluable in this period of ‘fake news’ and our staff are now better equipped in signposting the public to the best available resources.’<br />
          <strong>Alex Cunningham-Scott, Development Officer (Health and Wellbeing,) Somerset Libraries</strong></em></p>

          <h3>Training the public library staff- finding a friendly socially distanced solution</h3>

          <p>Pre-Covid-19, we delivered face-to-face workshops to public library staff at various locations across the county. It allowed us insight into the challenges they faced, and the logistics of releasing and bringing staff together for training. Nonetheless, our ability to bolster skills for supporting health information was well received. Now we are faced with an additional challenge: how best to produce a digital version of our training. Training for public library staff is increasingly moving online, making the logistics of meeting less of a challenge. Perhaps a webinar would work best? Or if we recorded it, then we’d only need to do it once. These challenges are mirrored not only when we consider delivering our training offer to service users within the Trust, but in conversations across our health libraries network regionally and nationally. Now is the time to illustrate just how adaptable we are in our profession.</p>

          <h3>Promotion of public library electronic and audio book collection</h3>

          <p>In March, just before the lockdown, we facilitated a meeting between trust staff and the public library’s development lead, outreach librarian, and (perhaps most crucially) their digital technician to discuss the practicalities of enabling access to their electronic collection for our patients and carers.</p>

          <p>We recruited trust staff with the following:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“We are currently working on a number of projects&nbsp;with our colleagues from the public library service. One of the ideas we have is around how best to utilise the public library electronic book/magazine stock and audio books for both staff and patients. These resources would promote wellbeing and also add to the patient experience while in hospital. You can find out more here:</em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="https://www.somerset.gov.uk/libraries-leisure-and-communities/libraries/library-facilities/e-books-e-magazines-and-e-audiobooks/">https://www.somerset.gov.uk/libraries-leisure-and-communities/libraries/library-facilities/e-books-e-magazines-and-e-audiobooks/</a>”</p>

          <p>Those who attended the meeting saw great potential for our patients; especially those staying with us for longer or undertaking rehabilitation and occupationally deprived.</p>

          <p>Handling personal information, age restrictions/censorship etc. were raised, but balanced with the positive outcomes of more digitally literate trust staff, and the public library service signing up at least 5 new members!</p>

          <p>As a result, a teacher in the hospital school described how <strong>“</strong>We have laminated the fliers and dotted them around the wards to advertise the service.&nbsp; We are hoping that patients will be able to use their own logins/devices to access the resources whilst patients and also when they leave us.”</p>

          <p>We are early on the journey to capturing the impact of this partnership project, but (apologies for over- egging the metaphor pudding) there is some surety to be found that when navigating the Covid-19 infodemic/misinformation storm, we can ride the tide together to lead patients and the public to quality health and wellbeing resources they can trust. The mutual benefits of the partnership are already evident.</p>

          <p>As we embark on Libraries Week 2020 alongside the context of Covid-19, it is timely to reflect on how we find stability in the professionalism and expertise of our colleagues locally, regionally and nationally, and extend this to collaborating with colleagues in other sectors.</p>

          <p>Enabling the flow of quality information and evidence is not only a strategic driver underpinning all that we do (knowledge management); it is the ethos with which we take professional pride.</p>

          <h3><strong>Actualising</strong> <strong> this is our superpower!</strong></h3>

          <p>Partnership working with Somerset public libraries has allowed Somerset NHS Foundation Trust library and knowledge services to see some successes in these challenging times.</p>

          <h3>Signposting to sources of trustworthy health information for Covid-19 and beyond</h3>

          <p>Establishing a good working relationship with the Development Officer (Health and Wellbeing) for Somerset Libraries worked well this year, especially for Health Information Week in July.</p>

          <p>Previous years’ activities centered on engaging library users who physically visited the public library sites, and were promoted through a media campaign which included presence in the local press and BBC Radio Somerset. This year we had to find a different way of meeting health information needs, instead condensing activities into a coordinated social media campaign, highlighting the health information available through both services.</p>

          <p>To set the scene, we provided public library staff with the following to inform their practice:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Health Education England’s national Library and Knowledge Services team has made available the <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/">https://library.nhs.uk/</a>&nbsp;website which hosts information resources which front line staff can use to help them communicate effectively with patients, clients, and their families around Coronavirus.</li>
           <li>The resources support NHS and social care organisations fulfil their obligations under the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/accessibleinfo/">Accessible Information Standard</a> to provide information for patients, service users, carers and parents with a disability, impairment or sensory loss.</li>
           <li>HEE’s Library and Knowledge Services team identified that it is difficult to find information about COVID-19 in accessible formats and for specific patient groups. In liaison with Public Health England, NHS England/Improvement and the Patient Information Forum, they have compiled information:</li>
          </ul>

          <ul style="margin-left:40px">
           <li><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/accessible-formats-2/">Coronavirus information in Accessible Formats</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/older-people/">Coronavirus information for Older People</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources/children-and-young-people/">Coronavirus information for Children and Young People</a>.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The website includes easy read, sign language and Makaton formats as well as other communication guidance.</p>

          <p>As a result of our Health Information Week collaboration, Somerset libraries are going to build on the above by adding a section to their website giving advice for accessing health information. We are exploring the possibilities of an interactive web version of the poster or linking to our own soon to be established website.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>‘Working with the staff at Musgrove Park Hospital library has been so helpful in providing us with the expertise and knowledge to ensure we are providing the public with the best information in accessing reliable health information. In particular, their training on finding reliable health information online, has been invaluable in this period of ‘fake news’ and our staff are now better equipped in signposting the public to the best available resources.’<br />
          <strong>Alex Cunningham-Scott, Development Officer (Health and Wellbeing,) Somerset Libraries</strong></em></p>

          <h3>Training the public library staff- finding a friendly socially distanced solution</h3>

          <p>Pre-Covid-19, we delivered face-to-face workshops to public library staff at various locations across the county. It allowed us insight into the challenges they faced, and the logistics of releasing and bringing staff together for training. Nonetheless, our ability to bolster skills for supporting health information was well received. Now we are faced with an additional challenge: how best to produce a digital version of our training. Training for public library staff is increasingly moving online, making the logistics of meeting less of a challenge. Perhaps a webinar would work best? Or if we recorded it, then we’d only need to do it once. These challenges are mirrored not only when we consider delivering our training offer to service users within the Trust, but in conversations across our health libraries network regionally and nationally. Now is the time to illustrate just how adaptable we are in our profession.</p>

          <h3>Promotion of public library electronic and audio book collection</h3>

          <p>In March, just before the lockdown, we facilitated a meeting between trust staff and the public library’s development lead, outreach librarian, and (perhaps most crucially) their digital technician to discuss the practicalities of enabling access to their electronic collection for our patients and carers.</p>

          <p>We recruited trust staff with the following:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“We are currently working on a number of projects&nbsp;with our colleagues from the public library service. One of the ideas we have is around how best to utilise the public library electronic book/magazine stock and audio books for both staff and patients. These resources would promote wellbeing and also add to the patient experience while in hospital. You can find out more here:</em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><a href="https://www.somerset.gov.uk/libraries-leisure-and-communities/libraries/library-facilities/e-books-e-magazines-and-e-audiobooks/">https://www.somerset.gov.uk/libraries-leisure-and-communities/libraries/library-facilities/e-books-e-magazines-and-e-audiobooks/</a>”</p>

          <p>Those who attended the meeting saw great potential for our patients; especially those staying with us for longer or undertaking rehabilitation and occupationally deprived.</p>

          <p>Handling personal information, age restrictions/censorship etc. were raised, but balanced with the positive outcomes of more digitally literate trust staff, and the public library service signing up at least 5 new members!</p>

          <p>As a result, a teacher in the hospital school described how <strong>“</strong>We have laminated the fliers and dotted them around the wards to advertise the service.&nbsp; We are hoping that patients will be able to use their own logins/devices to access the resources whilst patients and also when they leave us.”</p>

          <p>We are early on the journey to capturing the impact of this partnership project, but (apologies for over- egging the metaphor pudding) there is some surety to be found that when navigating the Covid-19 infodemic/misinformation storm, we can ride the tide together to lead patients and the public to quality health and wellbeing resources they can trust. The mutual benefits of the partnership are already evident.</p>

          <h3><strong>Services on offer</strong></h3>

          <p><strong>Readers’ Services</strong> – loaning of books and magazines, information /enquiry services provision</p>

          <p><strong>Outreach Services</strong> – taking reserved books to the cells of the young offenders who have constraints in visiting the library. Library Book return boxes (painted red) are located in all the Residential Blocks for prisoners to return loaned books and is emptied weekly by the library staff.</p>

          <p><strong>Readers Advisory Service</strong> – due to the fact that some of the young offenders are from various backgrounds – some with their first language not being English; others who have no formal education; some from the Travellers’ group and those from the English-speaking countries. A prison librarian needs subtle interactions aimed to inculcate reading habit and by extension promoting reading culture amongst them. As improvements are made, all are encouraged to enrol for some education courses.</p>

          <h3><strong>Activities engaged in</strong></h3>

          <p>The Prison Library liaises with various bodies for different activities as detailed below:</p>

          <p><strong>Six-Book Reading Ahead programme </strong>– organised annually by the Reading Agency to promote reading among young offenders. The completers attend Award ceremonies, where each completer has the Governor’s handshake and a 1:1 chat for 2 minutes.</p>

          <p><strong>Story Book Dads </strong>– this scheme is for young dads and those who wish to have contacts with their siblings. Stories are read from shortlisted books and recorded unto a CD for to send to their named recipients.</p>

          <p><strong>Shannon Trust</strong> – A charity aiming to support reading activity among the young offenders through supply of some guidebooks and workbooks and stationeries to work with.</p>

          <p><strong>The Bucks Association for the Care of Offenders (BACO)</strong> – which aims to bring about positive change to people serving sentences in Buckinghamshire’s prisons. They provide small funds to cover distance-learning courses (course books &amp; materials, plus art/craft materials), radios, smart clothing for interviews, to attend a Parole Board and family days amongst other things.</p>

          <p><strong>Guest Personalities and Authors’ visit </strong>– A number of ex-prisoners who have made their mark in the community visit for chats and to share their personal life experiences with the young offenders in custody. Some of these ex-prisoners are now authors of books, which they distribute free free-of-charge to the young offenders and for the library. There was a time that the World Boxing Champion, Anthony Joshua visited and had a down-to-earth talk with the young offenders on how to live outside of prison and be better persons, using himself as an example to emulate.</p>

          <p>We had finalised arrangements with the National Reading Agency to bring JaQuavis Coleman – one of the authors of the popular Urban fiction – “<em>The Cartel” Series</em> from the USA to visit our prison for a chat. Sadly, the COVID-19 lockdown has disrupted this event.</p>

          <p><strong>National Literacy Trust </strong>– has an ongoing 3-year partnership with HMYOI Aylesbury on “Working with Young Offenders<strong>”, </strong>as sponsored by the <em>Rothschild Foundation </em>– mainly to develop a discursive book club, enable mini wing libraries to ‘sell’ reading to their peers, authors’ discussion groups and workshops, amongst others. The Trust, through <em>one of its subsidiaries</em>, ‘<em>Books Unlocked’, </em>supplies books for the use Wing libraries.</p>

          <p><strong>Prison Reading Group in collaboration with Give-a-Book charity </strong>– regularly donating books to the library and sponsors the Librarian to attend their annual training day, usually held at the Roehampton University, London.</p>

          <p><strong>Going extra miles</strong> – The backsets of health-related magazines are made available to the Health Care Unit, as appropriate. This ensures regular access to those who may be more vulnerable and less able to access the main Library.</p>

          <p><strong>Health and well-being and the COVID-19 </strong>– With COVID lingering and social distancing being observed, big changes have been made in the prison. Education including Library staff are not allowed entry to the Wings for now. In addition, the labels (DO NOT SIT HERE) have been placed on some chairs to ensure that the visiting population will be about 30% of total.</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/728/article/33/made">Prison Rules 1999</a>, and <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/3371/article/26/made">Young Offender Institution Rules 2000</a><sup>,</sup> as amended, place on the Secretary of State the responsibility for ensuring that each Prison Service Establishment has a library, and that, subject to any directions of the Secretary of State, the prisoners of those establishments have facilities to use and exchange books. To complement success in education and vocation courses delivery, the Prison Library provides an accessible service. Through its collections, it supports learning, improving literacy and removing barriers to effective resettlement. It also promotes reading for pleasure and opportunities for wider cultural engagement by the prisoners.</p>

          <p>The Library as a unique facility and knowledge repository is present in any establishment or Society aiming at capacity building, research promotion and knowledge acquisition. The Prison Library at Aylesbury Prison is no different as access to materials stocked is boundless despite the prison being a locked-up facility. A comprehensive collection is provided – as books for curriculum support, well-being (on foods, nutrition, healthcare), as well as fiction, magazines and audio books including prison newspapers. Examples include Inside Times, Converse, and VOICE (newspaper for the BAME) Also, of importance is how library spaces are utilised and facilities provided.</p>

          <h3><strong>Services on offer</strong></h3>

          <p><strong>Readers’ Services</strong> – loaning of books and magazines, information /enquiry services provision</p>

          <p><strong>Outreach Services</strong> – taking reserved books to the cells of the young offenders who have constraints in visiting the library. Library Book return boxes (painted red) are located in all the Residential Blocks for prisoners to return loaned books and is emptied weekly by the library staff.</p>

          <p><strong>Readers Advisory Service</strong> – due to the fact that some of the young offenders are from various backgrounds – some with their first language not being English; others who have no formal education; some from the Travellers’ group and those from the English-speaking countries. A prison librarian needs subtle interactions aimed to inculcate reading habit and by extension promoting reading culture amongst them. As improvements are made, all are encouraged to enrol for some education courses.</p>

          <h3><strong>Activities engaged in</strong></h3>

          <p>The Prison Library liaises with various bodies for different activities as detailed below:</p>

          <p><strong>Six-Book Reading Ahead programme </strong>– organised annually by the Reading Agency to promote reading among young offenders. The completers attend Award ceremonies, where each completer has the Governor’s handshake and a 1:1 chat for 2 minutes.</p>

          <p><strong>Story Book Dads </strong>– this scheme is for young dads and those who wish to have contacts with their siblings. Stories are read from shortlisted books and recorded unto a CD for to send to their named recipients.</p>

          <p><strong>Shannon Trust</strong> – A charity aiming to support reading activity among the young offenders through supply of some guidebooks and workbooks and stationeries to work with.</p>

          <p><strong>The Bucks Association for the Care of Offenders (BACO)</strong> – which aims to bring about positive change to people serving sentences in Buckinghamshire’s prisons. They provide small funds to cover distance-learning courses (course books &amp; materials, plus art/craft materials), radios, smart clothing for interviews, to attend a Parole Board and family days amongst other things.</p>

          <p><strong>Guest Personalities and Authors’ visit </strong>– A number of ex-prisoners who have made their mark in the community visit for chats and to share their personal life experiences with the young offenders in custody. Some of these ex-prisoners are now authors of books, which they distribute free free-of-charge to the young offenders and for the library. There was a time that the World Boxing Champion, Anthony Joshua visited and had a down-to-earth talk with the young offenders on how to live outside of prison and be better persons, using himself as an example to emulate.</p>

          <p>We had finalised arrangements with the National Reading Agency to bring JaQuavis Coleman – one of the authors of the popular Urban fiction – “<em>The Cartel” Series</em> from the USA to visit our prison for a chat. Sadly, the COVID-19 lockdown has disrupted this event.</p>

          <p><strong>National Literacy Trust </strong>– has an ongoing 3-year partnership with HMYOI Aylesbury on “Working with Young Offenders<strong>”, </strong>as sponsored by the <em>Rothschild Foundation </em>– mainly to develop a discursive book club, enable mini wing libraries to ‘sell’ reading to their peers, authors’ discussion groups and workshops, amongst others. The Trust, through <em>one of its subsidiaries</em>, ‘<em>Books Unlocked’, </em>supplies books for the use Wing libraries.</p>

          <p><strong>Prison Reading Group in collaboration with Give-a-Book charity </strong>– regularly donating books to the library and sponsors the Librarian to attend their annual training day, usually held at the Roehampton University, London.</p>

          <p><strong>Going extra miles</strong> – The backsets of health-related magazines are made available to the Health Care Unit, as appropriate. This ensures regular access to those who may be more vulnerable and less able to access the main Library.</p>

          <p><strong>Health and well-being and the COVID-19 </strong>– With COVID lingering and social distancing being observed, big changes have been made in the prison. Education including Library staff are not allowed entry to the Wings for now. In addition, the labels (DO NOT SIT HERE) have been placed on some chairs to ensure that the visiting population will be about 30% of total.</p>

          <p>My transition into an apprenticeship and the start of my time in the NHS followed a long journey of higher education, part-time work and an ongoing unfulfillment with my professional progress. Initially pursuing an undergraduate degree was driven as the next logical step after my A-Levels, and my postgraduate degree seemed to temporarily fill a gap I thought needed filled. Alongside my educational career I worked in various administration roles in different sectors which made do at the time but never left me satisfied. Working in a library was always a goal of mine, but I was never quite sure how to get there. The librarian felt like a role you were born into, and the path towards it seemed almost hidden.</p>

          <p>Getting into my apprenticeship with Southmead Library was a fruitful result of a vigilant library career quest, including countless job searches and CV tweaks. When I saw the opportunity to join the LKS team as an apprentice I was immediately excited – professional and educational development? That was the dream! I was lucky enough to be picked for interview and when I received the congratulations call I was overcome with happiness and relief. My time in my role has far exceeded my expectations thanks to the brilliant team I have come into and my ever-growing understanding of what the role can encompass. A most recent example of this is getting the opportunity to look into decolonising the library collection, looking into expanding the diversity of both authors and visual content alongside compiling lists of reading materials and resources to implement. Being able to take on this project was not only relevant to me from a racial perspective, but highlighted the constant development of healthcare library collections and the potential for building more representative resources. I would never have imagined getting to undertake this kind of work so early in my role, so it has been a fruitful endeavour. In just under a year I feel I have come such a long way in my role thanks to the professional guidance of my colleagues, getting to grips with the daily operations of a healthcare library and opportunities to take on new responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Though my journey to my current role felt longer than expected I do not regret any of my experiences. Undertaking two degrees allowed me to hone my writing capabilities and the academic research has largely helped with searching for articles and navigating library classifications. Whilst administration was never my long term goal, it meant I developed a wide set of transferrable skills of working with different systems and responsibilities that are found across many office-based jobs. Doing an apprenticeship at this stage in my life has allowed me to put my goals into action and given me clear direction on how I want my career to progress. Assignments set by LMP and projects arising in the workplace equip me with both a broad and specialist insight into library provision.</p>

          <p>As a young professional, I hope my apprenticeship experience so far can help inform and encourage others looking for focused development to look into apprenticeship opportunities – it can introduce you to a whole new world of possibilities!</p>

          <p>Like many of you, when COVID hit I was expected to work from home for much of my working week. I quickly put dibs on the dining room table. I borrowed a work laptop that had recently been upgraded to Windows 10, which meant that I could easily connect to my computer files and Trust’s intranet. I purchased a computer chair after a week or so of enduring what I once thought were comfortable dining chairs and an ergonomic mouse that stopped me from getting RSI. All sorted.</p>

          <p>But there was one huge elephant in the room.</p>

          <p>Poor wifi connection – lots of coverage blackspots and our devices regularly fell off the wifi connection. We live in a weirdly shaped bungalow – it’s very long, with rooms going off at strange angles and lots of thick walls in the way. The router was located at the very back of the house in an extension the previous owners had built, and it was on a separate electrical network. This is an important point for trying to sort out connectivity issues.</p>

          <p>Ever since moving in, we’ve been trying to sort out this problem. I’ve spoken to our wifi providers – we’re on the fastest coverage possible for our area. I’ve spent a couple of evenings on the phone to them trying to tweak our set-up to get maximum oomph out of our connection, which included switching between different frequency channels depending on which ones were less well used at that particular point, and making sure there was nothing near it that could be stopping the signal etc. That didn’t make any difference.</p>

          <p>We investigated and purchased a wi-fi extender. The first one we tried was a powerline adaptor – these devices use existing electrical wiring to transmit data between them and extend the reach of the wifi. This is when we discovered that our router is on a different electrical circuit to the rest of the house, so that didn’t work. We next tried a general wireless extender, which acts as a relay to re-broadcast the signal onwards to other parts of the house. This made a small improvement, but we still had blackspots and devices dropping off wifi and needed a separate password.</p>

          <p>I investigated getting Virgin cable connected to our house. Note to self – never, ever purchase a house on a private road which can only be accessed via another private road. The Virgin technician very cheerfully told me I was a hiding to nothing there as I needed written permission from every home owner to say that they could tunnel under the roads, and did I have any inkling of the costs involved.</p>

          <p>A colleague mentioned to me that they had purchased a more expensive router which had sorted out their issues. Upon further investigation (I really recommend the free articles on the <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/wi-fi-routers-and-extenders/article/how-to-extend-your-wi-fi-aaPLn8h7oMgu">Which website</a>), I came across the idea of mesh routers. These are a network of hubs or satellites – one of them plugs into your existing modem (these days your router is often a combined router/modem) and the others are placed strategically around your house (we have our second hub in the loft). They are a more expensive solution but they have worked brilliantly for us. No more blackspots, no more dropping off wifi. I can get connectivity from any corner of the house. Most importantly, we can now watch television over the internet with zero buffering!</p>

          <p>Before purchasing anything as expensive as mesh routers, do your research. Check that the one you are planning on purchasing will be powerful enough for your size of house. Check that it really will eliminate all blackspots if this is your issue and how many devices it supports. I recommend <a href="https://www.techradar.com/">Techradar</a> as a good place to start; they also cover Black Friday deals if you fancy a bargain.</p>

          <h3><strong>Happy KNOWvember20 </strong> <strong>– will you been inspired to try something new?</strong></h3>

          <p>Library and knowledge staff across the country have been showcasing their work mobilising evidence and knowledge during the month of November.</p>

          <p>“As a result of this session I will look at how we can use learn at lunch type sessions or coffee conversations within the team and linking in with OD workstreams” Participant at KNOWvember20 Showcase</p>

          <p style="text-align:right">Participant at KNOWvember20 Showcase</p>

          <p>This year, more than any other, has highlighted the benefits of mobilising evidence and knowledge as part of the required response to the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp; A series of presentations on the 2<sup>nd</sup> November re-enforced this where we heard about the work of the NHS England and NHS Improvement Beneficial Change Network that used knowledge management activities to capture the innovations and changes that occurred in health and care delivery as a consequence of the Covid pandemic.&nbsp; Stephen Ayre shared how he had used the conversation café format at George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust to support staff wellbeing and Tracey Pratchett described how the premortem technique* had been used at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS FT to learn valuable lessons about the first wave of the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Some of us are also trying to move ahead with projects established just before Covid hit.&nbsp; We heard from Deena Maggs who described how she worked collaboratively with others in the Kings Fund to get agreement for her project to manage the corporate memory of the organisation.&nbsp; Whereas Preeti Puligari from Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust continued to run the QI poster competition to encourage the spread of good practice across her trust.&nbsp; We heard about how the library became involved and the opportunities that involvement presented for the library and knowledge service. During this session we also held a mini <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-pa-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=PwRPrv">Peer Assist</a> – using the questions from the peer assist technique to learn more from our speakers.&nbsp; Further details about the session with links to all the presentations can be found in the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://padlet.com/eekaat/sq3tqq77pqvttq0u" target="_blank">virtual delegate pack</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The 20&nbsp;November at 11am will consider how we can influence a culture of learning and knowledge sharing in our organisations.&nbsp; &nbsp;We will hear from speakers sharing the knowledge management initiatives they have been involved with, conduct the first part of an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-ai-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=agQxGi" target="_blank">appreciative inquiry</a> into what has gone well for others introducing KM, hold an <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-aar-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=V40u04" target="_blank">After Action Review</a> to discover what has worked or not worked well for two knowledge managers and hold a knowledge exchange to find out more about the NHSE/I Beneficial Change Unit.</p>

          <p>The 30November is the last of our recorded webinar sessions and we are excited to be joined by Nicola Millard, Principal Innovation Partner, BT Enterprise who will inspire us to consider the ways we live and work in a a&nbsp;future where technology is&nbsp;instrumental.&nbsp; We will follow this with a virtual&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-fishbowl-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=VUbByz" target="_blank">fishbowl conversation</a> to further explore the points made by Nicola.</p>

          <p>Starting from this week we will also be inviting library and knowledge specialists to record interviews with each other about the work they have been doing to mobilise evidence and knowledge in their organisations.&nbsp; This could be small scale holding of randomised coffee trials to full-blown implementation of knowledge management strategies.&nbsp; You can watch the first of these interviews with Sarah Lewis at Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, on the &nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d3LqU0J9pSDSozVg97qz0R2" target="_blank">KNOWvember20 YouTube Channel</a>.&nbsp; Here you will also find all the recorded talks from the sessions held throughout November plus interviews with knowledge managers working in other NHS and non-NHS sectors.</p>

          <p>Be inspired and tell us what you have been doing to mobilise evidence and knowledge.</p>

          <p>Library and Knowledge Services (LKS) at Nottinghamshire Healthcare sits within the Health Informatics (HIS) department. I’m fortunate that I am a member of the Senior HIS Management Team, which means I am strategically placed to advocate the skills and services of LKS within ICT. I realised that this had obviously worked when the Head of Digital Services (IT) asked if the LKS team would become Digital Champions for the Trust and support the role out of MS Teams across the whole Organisation during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>If you have not come across this before, Digital Champions support digital inclusion through sharing their knowledge and experience to help others develop their digital skills. You don’t have to be an IT guru to be one, but what is important is being motivated to help others at their own pace, and most importantly admitting when you don’t know the answer but will find out!</p>

          <p>As a member of the Digital Workplace Project Group, responsible for enabling our Trust to work more digitally, I knew the plan was always to roll out teams using a Digital Champion network within both clinical and non-clinical teams across our Organisation. However, COVID forced our hand. The roll out we had been planning was changed from months to days. The Teams pilot, which LKS had been part of, had to be upscaled to the whole Trust in record time. &nbsp;The LKS team would become the Digital Champions for the entire Organisation to take the additional pressure away from our IT Support Service.</p>

          <p>There was no remit of how this support should be delivered but COVID meant that we must deliver support virtually. A dedicated inbox was created to manage enquiries, although we also responded via telephone, MS Teams and email depending on the complexity of the enquiry, enquirers preference and the implied digital literacy level of the enquirer.&nbsp; We applied the same level of customer service that we use in LKS to respond quickly and answer enquiries directly to keep the business of the Organisation moving.</p>

          <p>Based on the frequently asked questions we were receiving we created an MS Teams support page hosted on our Intranet. We created short visual support materials and provided frequent updates to the ever changing functionally of Teams.&nbsp; This enabled us to signpost to key guidance and encourage independent learning across the Trust. We began hosting weekly ‘Drop in Sessions’ to cover the basics of MS Teams, giving staff the opportunity to see demonstrations and ask questions, as well as providing sessions for individual teams if requested. Due to the success and high demand we now offer daily ‘Drop in Sessions’. We write communications for the daily Chief Executive staff bulletin and weekly Line Managers update highlighting any changes or new functionality and signposting to the help section if a query has been raised several times recently. &nbsp;We created an MS Team consisting of the Digital Champions and IT Support Service to facilitate knowledge sharing and problem solving. We are now adopting a more strategic level approach to aid adoption across the Organisation by approaching Managers directly, gaining an understanding of their information needs and selling the benefits of using teams and suggesting appropriate tools they could use with their teams.</p>

          <p>At project level I have been involved in all aspects of the rollout and decision-making process, including governance and permission settings. Our Microsoft partner recognised the importance of having a Knowledge Manager involved at this level and the enhanced benefits this can bring. &nbsp;I have been able to argue for the functionality I believe the business needs, including the upgrade of Communities (Yammer), so we can pilot this tool for Communities of Practice. I am the critical friend representing the user point of view, constantly reminding that digital literacy skills vary across the Organisation, and one training style does not fit all. Personally, as a relatively new manager it has been a fantastic learning opportunity to be centrally involved in a project at such scale and to work so closely and learn from our Senior Project Manager.</p>

          <p>We made the decision from the onset that we would be transparent about who the Digital Champions were to raise the profile of the library across the Organisation. This may have been considered risky, but I wanted to showcase to our Trust what LKS can do, and we may never have this type of opportunity again. Although I haven’t got any metrics to substantiate this, I believe this has been effective. We have had some fantastic feedback, and colleagues appreciate our swift response to queries and our excellent customer service. Our “can do” attitude has built stronger relationships within not only IT but also with other services across the Trust, where I’m hoping “from little acorns mighty oaks grow”.</p>

          <p>Our involvement in Digital Champions will continue whilst the project group work to develop what the long-term support for MS Teams and wider O365 tools will look like for our Trust. In the short- term we are looking to knowledge share and offer further training to volunteers within local teams across the Trust to grow the Digital Champions Network further.</p>

          <p>At the beginning we were all apprehensive about taking on this role and moving out of our ‘library comfort zone’, but we knew we had the skills to do this, even if we were still developing the knowledge. All of us have found Digital Champions hugely rewarding as well as challenging at times! Most importantly we can see the difference we are making supporting our colleagues to change their working practices to continue to deliver services in these difficult times.</p>

          <p><strong><em>“Every politician, every system leader should be asking, ‘Where is your librarian…?’”</em></strong></p>

          <p>Patrick Mitchell, Director of Innovation and Transformation, Health Education England suggested this at the conclusion of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Libraries meeting on Mon 2 Nov 2020.</p>

          <p>A ground-breaking independent value proposition report <strong><em>Library and Knowledge Services Value Proposition: The Gift of Time </em></strong>was launched at the APPG<em>.&nbsp; </em>The report outlines the true value of NHS Library and Knowledge Services and demonstrates both a direct and indirect effect on the care patients receive. Library and Knowledge Services make a positive impact on the Service as a whole, representing an economic value of millions of pounds to the NHS.</p>

          <p>All healthcare staff are short of an invaluable resource – time.&nbsp; Time to spend caring for their patients while being confident they are using the most relevant, evidence-based information to plan and deliver that care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Health librarians and knowledge specialists make the gathering of information as easy as possible for healthcare professionals, relieving the burden of sourcing and synthesising evidence&nbsp;while enabling&nbsp;NHS organisations to meet their statutory obligation&nbsp;to use evidence from research.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/library-knowledge-services/value-proposition-gift-time"><strong>Read the report</strong></a> and look at the findings from a recently published international literature review [see p21 of Report for list of referenced materials] that showed that for every $1 of funding spent on library and knowledge services a return of $2.4&nbsp;is received.&nbsp; If applicable to the NHS it suggests that library and knowledge services are already delivering a net economic benefit of £77m per annum. Were Health Education England’s <a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/library-knowledge-services"><strong>recommended staff ratio</strong></a> for qualified librarians per member of the NHS workforce achieved, this could increase to £106m per annum.&nbsp;Moreover, this includes only the benefits of time saving and expense, not the value of improvement to patient care, safety, and operational efficiencies.</p>

          <p>Patrick Mitchell said: <em>“This report gives us some truly great insight into the value that embedded NHS Library and Knowledge Services bring to staff at all levels of the healthcare system when planning and delivering care for local people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>Librarians are probably not the first role that spring to mind when people think about the NHS. However, the part they play, and the specialist expertise they provide, give clinicians some of the most important tools they have to treat patients effectively – information, and time. All the evidence shows that the right knowledge services improve outcomes for patients."</em></p>

          <p>Sue Lacey Bryant, National Lead for NHS Library and Knowledge Services, Health Education England said: <em>“</em><em>We are passionate about the positive impact that librarians and knowledge managers have on the quality of care. Our</em><em> regional library teams will now work with NHS&nbsp;organisations and local NHS library services to help the NHS fully realise all these benefits.”</em></p>

          <p>Earlier this year <em>Knowledge for Health</em> commissioned me to develop a Research Toolkit based on a research flowchart originally developed by members of the now defunct HEALER (Health Information and Libraries for Evaluation and Research) Network. Launched in April 2020, the <a href="research-toolkit_1">Research Toolkit</a>&nbsp; provides ten simple steps as a starting point for health LKS workers wishing to undertake research.</p>

          <p>The ten steps highlights issues to consider and resources to help guide you through the research process, from turning your idea into a research question, designing your study, obtaining trust approval, collecting, collating, analysing and interpreting your data, and disseminating your findings.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Writing for publication was already recognised in Step 9 of the Research Toolkit. However, the importance of acknowledging writing in the planning process of a project and, being mindful of the end of goal of sharing findings, lead to an invitation to further develop the Research Toolkit this autumn.</p>

          <p>At first glance, writing for publication can seem like something that you only need to think about when your project is completed, though its influence can be felt throughout the research process. When designing your research, you may choose to pre-register your research plan as part the movement to improving quality and transparency of research. If you’re involving participants in any research you plan to publish, you’ll need to let them know in your consent form, assuring confidentiality, while your funders may have expectations and provide <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/">guidance on how you make your findings available</a>.&nbsp;Knowing you’re planning to publish your findings can also inform the notes you keep to ensure you can meet the <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network reporting guidelines.</a></p>

          <p>The publishing landscape is changing, and it’s increasingly common to want to publish your work open access. Open access can be more than making research available to read. As well as increasing the reach of your findings it can mean your data is similarly more widely available. Not only that but publishing open access can help improve research quality through open, transparent and reproducible research practice. And for those for whom it’s important, open access has been shown to increase the number of citations received.</p>

          <p>There are lots of useful resources outlining the range of <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/an-introduction-to-open-access">open access models</a> available (diamond open access anyone?), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQaqSe96pnc">busting the jargon on all things open access</a>,&nbsp; and <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">summarising the copyright and open access archiving policies for publishers around the world</a>.</p>

          <p>Some publishers have signed <a href="https://esac-initiative.org/">transitional agreements</a> with national bodies to facilitate ‘read and publish’ deals. This can mean that if you’re a corresponding author for a paper and affiliated with a participating institution e.g. based in an NHS trust affiliated to a university, you’re eligible to access funds to cover your article processing charge to provide open access to your work.</p>

          <p>Writing for publication shouldn’t be viewed as an add on to a research project but be recognised as an integral part of the research process. The extended Research Toolkit is now available&nbsp; and provides links to a wide variety of resources to help guide and support your writing choices.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year <em>Knowledge for Health</em> commissioned me to develop a Research Toolkit based on a research flowchart originally developed by members of the now defunct HEALER (Health Information and Libraries for Evaluation and Research) Network. Launched in April 2020, the <a href="research-toolkit_1">Research Toolkit</a>&nbsp; provides ten simple steps as a starting point for health LKS workers wishing to undertake research.</p>

          <p>The ten steps highlights issues to consider and resources to help guide you through the research process, from turning your idea into a research question, designing your study, obtaining trust approval, collecting, collating, analysing and interpreting your data, and disseminating your findings.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Writing for publication was already recognised in Step 9 of the Research Toolkit. However, the importance of acknowledging writing in the planning process of a project and, being mindful of the end of goal of sharing findings, lead to an invitation to further develop the Research Toolkit this autumn.</p>

          <p>At first glance, writing for publication can seem like something that you only need to think about when your project is completed, though its influence can be felt throughout the research process. When designing your research, you may choose to pre-register your research plan as part the movement to improving quality and transparency of research. If you’re involving participants in any research you plan to publish, you’ll need to let them know in your consent form, assuring confidentiality, while your funders may have expectations and provide <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/">guidance on how you make your findings available</a>.&nbsp;Knowing you’re planning to publish your findings can also inform the notes you keep to ensure you can meet the <a href="https://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network reporting guidelines.</a></p>

          <p>The publishing landscape is changing, and it’s increasingly common to want to publish your work open access. Open access can be more than making research available to read. As well as increasing the reach of your findings it can mean your data is similarly more widely available. Not only that but publishing open access can help improve research quality through open, transparent and reproducible research practice. And for those for whom it’s important, open access has been shown to increase the number of citations received.</p>

          <p>There are lots of useful resources outlining the range of <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/guides/an-introduction-to-open-access">open access models</a> available (diamond open access anyone?), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQaqSe96pnc">busting the jargon on all things open access</a>,&nbsp; and <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">summarising the copyright and open access archiving policies for publishers around the world</a>.</p>

          <p>Some publishers have signed <a href="https://esac-initiative.org/">transitional agreements</a> with national bodies to facilitate ‘read and publish’ deals. This can mean that if you’re a corresponding author for a paper and affiliated with a participating institution e.g. based in an NHS trust affiliated to a university, you’re eligible to access funds to cover your article processing charge to provide open access to your work.</p>

          <p>Writing for publication shouldn’t be viewed as an add on to a research project but be recognised as an integral part of the research process. The extended Research Toolkit is now available&nbsp; and provides links to a wide variety of resources to help guide and support your writing choices.</p>

          <p>Like everyone we have had to adapt in this extraordinary year and I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone involved in the workstream for their hard work, patience and above all adaptability this year.</p>

          <p>The CPD Group has&nbsp;delivered an amazing programme this year, with more to come in the Spring: “Library Carpentry”(see below) and further workshops to develop your scanning and synthesising skills.</p>

          <p>The third cohort of our senior leadership development programme had a virtual kick off in October and the eight participants are well on their way. With support from Maggie Woods at HEE,&nbsp;Tracey Pratchett has turned our former face to face programme of&nbsp; workshops into a 19 module programmes.</p>

          <p>Gil Young has been working with Jo Cornish at CILIP as part of a cross-sectoral working group setting up a Trailblazer group for a level 6/7 apprenticeship in library, information sciences and knowledge management. Gil has also been our key link into Manchester Metropolitans’ Department of Languages, Information &amp; Communications working on the next iteration of the health libraries elective module that ran last year – this needs something of a rethink to fit in with the University’s new style of teaching.</p>

          <p>Things to watch out for:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Health Education England’s Digital skills self-assessment tool which will be rolled out to the whole NHS workforce in England</li>
           <li>Library Carpentry programme – providing an opportunity for participants to deepen their skills in understanding software development and data science]</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You may know that&nbsp;I am retiring in March 2021, and already starting to focus on the things that need sorting, filing and handing on.&nbsp;We have a&nbsp;new Chair for the Workforce Planning and Development workstream as&nbsp;I have handed on the baton to Dominic Gilroy. Dominic is now taking the lead responsibility for this workstream. I wish him and all of you every success.</p>

          <p>What activities are we talking about when we describe research as an enabler of Knowledge for Healthcare? Fundamentally, there are two key dimensions: research that takes forward the ongoing development of the strategy; and resources to enable local health library and knowledge services staff to develop their research skills.</p>

          <p><strong>Knowledge for Healthcare</strong></p>

          <p>Health Education England has experience of funding specific research studies that inform understanding of the role that can be played by NHS library and knowledge services, such as a study of the <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/About/wuth-critical-care-research-report-jan-2020.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zlN1Ck">clinical librarian role</a> in the Wirral. We are building on this experience to work with a new Research Advisory Group on research developments from 2021 onwards.</p>

          <h3><strong>2020 Successes:</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>Two updates of the <a href="research-toolkit_1">Research Toolkit</a> developed originally by the former HEAlth information and Libraries for Education and Research group (HEALER), including new content on Open Access</li>
           <li>Series of online workshops on different aspects of <a href="writing-for-publication-and-the-research-toolkit_1">research and writing for publication</a></li>
           <li>Commissioning and overseeing research into the measures we can use to assess the impact of knowledge mobilisation activities by NHS library and knowledge services staff</li>
           <li>Establishing Research Advisory Group to provide expert advice on our research activity as part of <em>Knowledge for Healthcare</em></li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Things to look out for in 2021:</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>Commissioning new research study into knowledge mobilisation</li>
           <li>Further opportunities to develop your research thinking and skills</li>
          </ul>

          <p>What activities are we talking about when we describe research as an enabler of Knowledge for Healthcare? Fundamentally, there are two key dimensions: research that takes forward the ongoing development of the strategy; and resources to enable local health library and knowledge services staff to develop their research skills.</p>

          <p><strong>Knowledge for Healthcare</strong></p>

          <p>Health Education England has experience of funding specific research studies that inform understanding of the role that can be played by NHS library and knowledge services, such as a study of the <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/About/wuth-critical-care-research-report-jan-2020.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zlN1Ck">clinical librarian role</a> in the Wirral. We are building on this experience to work with a new Research Advisory Group on research developments from 2021 onwards.</p>

          <h3><strong>2020 Successes:</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>Two updates of the <a href="research-toolkit_1">Research Toolkit</a> developed originally by the former HEAlth information and Libraries for Education and Research group (HEALER), including new content on Open Access</li>
           <li>Series of online workshops on different aspects of <a href="writing-for-publication-and-the-research-toolkit_1">research and writing for publication</a></li>
           <li>Commissioning and overseeing research into the measures we can use to assess the impact of knowledge mobilisation activities by NHS library and knowledge services staff</li>
           <li>Establishing Research Advisory Group to provide expert advice on our research activity as part of <em>Knowledge for Healthcare</em></li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Things to look out for in 2021:</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>Commissioning new research study into knowledge mobilisation</li>
           <li>Further opportunities to develop your research thinking and skills</li>

          <p>As 2020 draws to a close it is a traditional time for reflection, and we could not reflect on the Mobilising Evidence and Knowledge workstream without at the same time using some of the techniques from the NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework – <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/KM-Framework-Postcards-retrospect-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=DY8yGy">The Retrospect</a></p>

          <h2><strong>What was the objective? What did or didn’t we achieve and why?</strong></h2>

          <p>Emphasising the critical role played by NHS knowledge specialists and librarians to mobilise evidence and knowledge across the NHS was a main objective. Much has been achieved in the first five years, mainly due to how well NHS library and knowledge staff across England have embraced this work, building their confidence and developing their skills to mobilise evidence and knowledge.</p>

          <h2><strong>What were the successes?</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>#AMillionDecisions</strong></h3>

          <p><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/our-work/making-a-positive-impact/">#AMillionDecisions</a> raised our profile. It calls on government and health service providers to meet their statutory obligations to ensure the million decisions made every day in healthcare are informed by evidence. It encourages healthcare staff to work with and use the expertise of librarians and knowledge specialists to get evidence into practice. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>From this work evolved a bank of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNB-ScmkQIo&amp;list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d1dpyRS2B1g_nX73fwxKPDI">impact case study vignettes</a></p>

          <h3><strong>Extending Reach</strong></h3>

          <p>Using a range of evidence and tacit knowledge to inform and respond to system level healthcare has been delivered by the “bottom-up” partnership approach of the STEMClub (Sustainability and Evidence Mobilisation) in the North East of England. Adopting models similar to STEMClub are likely to increase in 2021 with the announcement from NHS England that Integrated Care Systems (ICS) are to have more statutory functions, potentially taking on a commissioning role in 2021. See the blog post on the <a href="the-stem-club-in-the-north-east-of-england">STEM club in the North East of&nbsp;England</a></p>

          <h3><strong>Skills development – workshops and study days</strong></h3>

          <p>In February 2020 thirty library and knowledge service staff attended a two-day knowledge mobilisation course facilitated by knowledge management consultant Chris Collison. This core group of individuals work as a reference group for future mobilising evidence and knowledge work.</p>

          <h3><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>The Knowledge Management Task and Finish Group developed the <a href="knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit">Knowledge Management Toolkit</a> to share techniques and stories about how knowledge management has been used in practice.</li>
           <li>Publication of the enhanced <a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/">NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework E-learning</a> introduced the concepts of learning before, during and after and demonstrated the benefits of using 11 simple knowledge mobilisation techniques. The accompanying <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-full-set-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=XLcRXs">postcard sets</a> were expanded in 2019 to include additional techniques of Appreciative Inquiry and Fishbowl Conversations. Feedback has been positive with Dr Farzana Hussain, GP of the Year 2019 commenting on the After Action Review technique that</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">“It has changed my staff meetings and significant-event analyses, the non-judgemental approach supporting a no blame culture”.</p>

          <ul>
           <li>The <a href="self-assessment-tool">self-assessment tool</a> for organisations to consider opportunities to develop how they are using external evidence and organisational knowledge. A series of modifications were made to the tool and the current version has been used by several organisations to help plan and prioritise activities. We are currently working on developing a digitised format for this tool with the help of our knowledge champions.</li>
           <li>A space to share ideas, resources and ask questions has been developed with the <a href="knowledge-mobilisation-community-of-practice">Knowledge Management Community of Practice</a>. It is a great way to encourage learning, develop a knowledge base and build confidence to practice some techniques.</li>
           <li>The <a href="policies-procedures-and-guidelines">Policies Procedures and Guidelines Toolkit</a> was developed to capture and share good practice around supporting the production and management of these vital knowledge assets. &nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to people, people to research and raising the profile of an organisation by exploring different ways to promote locally produced research are explored in the <a href="open-access-repositories">Institutional Repository Toolkit</a> which presents an ideas bank and hints and tips for implementing a local repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Learning lessons from Covid-19</strong></h3>

          <p>Rapid learning, spread of knowledge and use of evidence was essential for the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. CILIP held a virtual conference in May 2020 exploring the role of knowledge management in a time of crisis. Perspectives were shared from knowledge specialists working in various sectors including the NHS. A series of thought-provoking questions were raised, including how we take <a href="what-is-the-use-of-knowledge-management-in-a-time-">learning from a crisis and apply to our everyday practice</a>.</p>

          <p>This topic was explored further by Holly Case Wyatt who shared tools to<a href="lesson-learnt-supporting-your-organisation-to-capt"> rapidly share learning from Covid-19</a> including a framework from Collaborate for Care.</p>

          <p>We also produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUkO026YWhI&amp;list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d2CJhsqB1Y-36h78vVB7LOu&amp;index=12">short recorded presentation</a> about the Before Action Review, After Action Review and Retrospect as a suite of tools to encourage the sharing and re-use of lessons learnt.</p>

          <h3><strong>KNOWvember</strong></h3>

          <p>KNOWvember is an annual celebration and showcase of the work by NHS library and knowledge staff to mobilise evidence and knowledge. The aim of KNOWvember events is to share practical examples of how library and knowledge service staff have used techniques to encourage more widespread use of evidence and sharing of know-how across the NHS. This in turn generates ideas for more knowledge mobilisation to take place.</p>

          <p>Four virtual events were held in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d3LqU0J9pSDSozVg97qz0R2">KNOWvember20</a> featuring work by various library and knowledge specialists coupled with opportunities to experience a variety of knowledge mobilisation techniques. We were also joined by external speakers including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvYr5H2duOs&amp;list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d3LqU0J9pSDSozVg97qz0R2&amp;index=3&amp;t=293s">CILIP Trustee Karen McFarlane</a>, who provided an overview of the BSI/ISO 30401 Knowledge Management Systems Standard and CILIP’s Knowledge Management Chartership and <a href="https://youtu.be/x1bKCO1VVg8">Dr Nicola Millard, Principal Innovation Partner at BT</a> who shared insights into the digital workplace.

          <h2><strong>What could have been even better?</strong></h2>

          <p>We know that terminology has at times proved challenging.</p>

          <p>As the ISO 30401:2018 Knowledge Management Systems Standard says there is no single accepted definition of knowledge management and our preferred term is knowledge mobilisation emphasising that knowledge needs to be used and not just managed. <a href="km-to-km--knowledge-management-to-knowledge-mobili">David Stewart’s reflection</a> considers this change in terminology and presents a long view concluding that knowledge management is no longer a “nice to have” trend but that KM will become the every-day core of what we do” – delivering Knowledge and Library Services to ensure that organisational knowledge and best evidence are mobilised to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.</p>

          <h3><strong>Marks out of 10 for the work as a whole? What would have made it a 10?</strong></h3>

          <p>The work to date deserves at least an eight as demonstrated by the range of mobilising evidence and knowledge work showcased at the recent KNOWvember20 events. It will become a 10 when even more NHS staff routinely use evidence and share knowledge to inform their decisions.</p>

          <p>A big thank you to all who have contributed to this work, and in particular to our knowledge champions. We wish you time for your own reflection over the festive break and look forward to working with you on the next chapter of this story in the new year.</p>

          <p>As 2020 draws to a close it is a traditional time for reflection, and we could not reflect on the Mobilising Evidence and Knowledge workstream without at the same time using some of the techniques from the NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework – <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/KM-Framework-Postcards-retrospect-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=DY8yGy">The Retrospect</a></p>

          <h2><strong>What was the objective? What did or didn’t we achieve and why?</strong></h2>

          <p>Emphasising the critical role played by NHS knowledge specialists and librarians to mobilise evidence and knowledge across the NHS was a main objective. Much has been achieved in the first five years, mainly due to how well NHS library and knowledge staff across England have embraced this work, building their confidence and developing their skills to mobilise evidence and knowledge.</p>

          <h2><strong>What were the successes?</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>#AMillionDecisions</strong></h3>

          <p><a href="https://library.nhs.uk/our-work/making-a-positive-impact/">#AMillionDecisions</a> raised our profile. It calls on government and health service providers to meet their statutory obligations to ensure the million decisions made every day in healthcare are informed by evidence. It encourages healthcare staff to work with and use the expertise of librarians and knowledge specialists to get evidence into practice. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3><strong>Extending Reach</strong></h3>

          <p>Using a range of evidence and tacit knowledge to inform and respond to system level healthcare has been delivered by the “bottom-up” partnership approach of the STEMClub (Sustainability and Evidence Mobilisation) in the North East of England. Adopting models similar to STEMClub are likely to increase in 2021 with the announcement from NHS England that Integrated Care Systems (ICS) are to have more statutory functions, potentially taking on a commissioning role in 2021. See the blog post on the <a href="the-stem-club-in-the-north-east-of-england">STEM club in the North East of&nbsp;England</a></p>

          <h3><strong>Skills development – workshops and study days</strong></h3>

          <p>In February 2020 thirty library and knowledge service staff attended a two-day knowledge mobilisation course facilitated by knowledge management consultant Chris Collison. This core group of individuals work as a reference group for future mobilising evidence and knowledge work.</p>

          <h3><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>The Knowledge Management Task and Finish Group developed the <a href="knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit">Knowledge Management Toolkit</a> to share techniques and stories about how knowledge management has been used in practice.</li>
           <li>Publication of the enhanced <a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/">NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework E-learning</a> introduced the concepts of learning before, during and after and demonstrated the benefits of using 11 simple knowledge mobilisation techniques. The accompanying <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-full-set-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=XLcRXs">postcard sets</a> were expanded in 2019 to include additional techniques of Appreciative Inquiry and Fishbowl Conversations. Feedback has been positive with Dr Farzana Hussain, GP of the Year 2019 commenting on the After Action Review technique that</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">“It has changed my staff meetings and significant-event analyses, the non-judgemental approach supporting a no blame culture”.</p>

          <ul>
           <li>The <a href="self-assessment-tool">self-assessment tool</a> for organisations to consider opportunities to develop how they are using external evidence and organisational knowledge. A series of modifications were made to the tool and the current version has been used by several organisations to help plan and prioritise activities. We are currently working on developing a digitised format for this tool with the help of our knowledge champions.</li>
           <li>A space to share ideas, resources and ask questions has been developed with the <a href="knowledge-mobilisation-community-of-practice">Knowledge Management Community of Practice</a>. It is a great way to encourage learning, develop a knowledge base and build confidence to practice some techniques.</li>
           <li>The <a href="policies-procedures-and-guidelines">Policies Procedures and Guidelines Toolkit</a> was developed to capture and share good practice around supporting the production and management of these vital knowledge assets. &nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to people, people to research and raising the profile of an organisation by exploring different ways to promote locally produced research are explored in the <a href="open-access-repositories">Institutional Repository Toolkit</a> which presents an ideas bank and hints and tips for implementing a local repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Learning lessons from Covid-19</strong></h3>

          <p>Rapid learning, spread of knowledge and use of evidence was essential for the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. CILIP held a virtual conference in May 2020 exploring the role of knowledge management in a time of crisis. Perspectives were shared from knowledge specialists working in various sectors including the NHS. A series of thought-provoking questions were raised, including how we take <a href="what-is-the-use-of-knowledge-management-in-a-time-">learning from a crisis and apply to our everyday practice</a>.</p>

          <p>This topic was explored further by Holly Case Wyatt who shared tools to<a href="lesson-learnt-supporting-your-organisation-to-capt"> rapidly share learning from Covid-19</a> including a framework from Collaborate for Care.</p>

          <p>We also produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUkO026YWhI&amp;list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d2CJhsqB1Y-36h78vVB7LOu&amp;index=12">short recorded presentation</a> about the Before Action Review, After Action Review and Retrospect as a suite of tools to encourage the sharing and re-use of lessons learnt.</p>

          <h3><strong>Extending Reach</strong></h3>

          <p>Using a range of evidence and tacit knowledge to inform and respond to system level healthcare has been delivered by the “bottom-up” partnership approach of the STEMClub (Sustainability and Evidence Mobilisation) in the North East of England. Adopting models similar to STEMClub are likely to increase in 2021 with the announcement from NHS England that Integrated Care Systems (ICS) are to have more statutory functions, potentially taking on a commissioning role in 2021. See the blog post on the <a href="the-stem-club-in-the-north-east-of-england">STEM club in the North East of&nbsp;England</a></p>

          <h3><strong>Skills development – workshops and study days</strong></h3>

          <p>In February 2020 thirty library and knowledge service staff attended a two-day knowledge mobilisation course facilitated by knowledge management consultant Chris Collison. This core group of individuals work as a reference group for future mobilising evidence and knowledge work.</p>

          <h3><strong>Tools and Techniques</strong></h3>

          <ul>
           <li>The Knowledge Management Task and Finish Group developed the <a href="knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit">Knowledge Management Toolkit</a> to share techniques and stories about how knowledge management has been used in practice.</li>
           <li>Publication of the enhanced <a href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/">NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework E-learning</a> introduced the concepts of learning before, during and after and demonstrated the benefits of using 11 simple knowledge mobilisation techniques. The accompanying <a href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/Knowledge%20mobilisation/km-framework-postcards-full-set-2019.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=XLcRXs">postcard sets</a> were expanded in 2019 to include additional techniques of Appreciative Inquiry and Fishbowl Conversations. Feedback has been positive with Dr Farzana Hussain, GP of the Year 2019 commenting on the After Action Review technique that</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left: 40px;">“It has changed my staff meetings and significant-event analyses, the non-judgemental approach supporting a no blame culture”.</p>

          <ul>
           <li>The <a href="self-assessment-tool">self-assessment tool</a> for organisations to consider opportunities to develop how they are using external evidence and organisational knowledge. A series of modifications were made to the tool and the current version has been used by several organisations to help plan and prioritise activities. We are currently working on developing a digitised format for this tool with the help of our knowledge champions.</li>
           <li>A space to share ideas, resources and ask questions has been developed with the <a href="knowledge-mobilisation-community-of-practice">Knowledge Management Community of Practice</a>. It is a great way to encourage learning, develop a knowledge base and build confidence to practice some techniques.</li>
           <li>The <a href="policies-procedures-and-guidelines">Policies Procedures and Guidelines Toolkit</a> was developed to capture and share good practice around supporting the production and management of these vital knowledge assets. &nbsp;</li>
           <li>Connecting people to people, people to research and raising the profile of an organisation by exploring different ways to promote locally produced research are explored in the <a href="open-access-repositories">Institutional Repository Toolkit</a> which presents an ideas bank and hints and tips for implementing a local repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><strong>Learning lessons from Covid-19</strong></h3>

          <p>Rapid learning, spread of knowledge and use of evidence was essential for the response to the Covid-19 pandemic. CILIP held a virtual conference in May 2020 exploring the role of knowledge management in a time of crisis. Perspectives were shared from knowledge specialists working in various sectors including the NHS. A series of thought-provoking questions were raised, including how we take <a href="what-is-the-use-of-knowledge-management-in-a-time-">learning from a crisis and apply to our everyday practice</a>.</p>

          <p>This topic was explored further by Holly Case Wyatt who shared tools to<a href="lesson-learnt-supporting-your-organisation-to-capt"> rapidly share learning from Covid-19</a> including a framework from Collaborate for Care.</p>

          <p>We also produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUkO026YWhI&amp;list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d2CJhsqB1Y-36h78vVB7LOu&amp;index=12">short recorded presentation</a> about the Before Action Review, After Action Review and Retrospect as a suite of tools to encourage the sharing and re-use of lessons learnt.</p>

          <h3><strong>KNOWvember</strong></h3>

          <p>KNOWvember is an annual celebration and showcase of the work by NHS library and knowledge staff to mobilise evidence and knowledge. The aim of KNOWvember events is to share practical examples of how library and knowledge service staff have used techniques to encourage more widespread use of evidence and sharing of know-how across the NHS. This in turn generates ideas for more knowledge mobilisation to take place.</p>

          <p>Four virtual events were held in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d3LqU0J9pSDSozVg97qz0R2">KNOWvember20</a> featuring work by various library and knowledge specialists coupled with opportunities to experience a variety of knowledge mobilisation techniques. We were also joined by external speakers including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvYr5H2duOs&amp;list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d3LqU0J9pSDSozVg97qz0R2&amp;index=3&amp;t=293s">CILIP Trustee Karen McFarlane</a>, who provided an overview of the BSI/ISO 30401 Knowledge Management Systems Standard and CILIP’s Knowledge Management Chartership and <a href="https://youtu.be/x1bKCO1VVg8">Dr Nicola Millard, Principal Innovation Partner at BT</a> who shared insights into the digital workplace. Presentations from these events, plus summaries of discussions and recorded conversations between knowledge specialists, can be found on the Knowledge for Healthcare <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHsnQ0dxz1d3LqU0J9pSDSozVg97qz0R2">KNOWvember20 YouTube Playlist</a>.</p>

          <h2><strong>What could have been even better?</strong></h2>

          <p>We know that terminology has at times proved challenging.</p>

          <p>As the ISO 30401:2018 Knowledge Management Systems Standard says there is no single accepted definition of knowledge management and our preferred term is knowledge mobilisation emphasising that knowledge needs to be used and not just managed. <a href="km-to-km--knowledge-management-to-knowledge-mobili">David Stewart’s reflection</a> considers this change in terminology and presents a long view concluding that knowledge management is no longer a “nice to have” trend but that KM will become the every-day core of what we do” – delivering Knowledge and Library Services to ensure that organisational knowledge and best evidence are mobilised to achieve excellent healthcare and health improvement.</p>

          <h3><strong>Marks out of 10 for the work as a whole? What would have made it a 10?</strong></h3>

          <p>The work to date deserves at least an eight as demonstrated by the range of mobilising evidence and knowledge work showcased at the recent KNOWvember20 events. It will become a 10 when even more NHS staff routinely use evidence and share knowledge to inform their decisions.</p>

          <p>A big thank you to all who have contributed to this work, and in particular to our knowledge champions. We wish you time for your own reflection over the festive break and look forward to working with you on the next chapter of this story in the new year.</p>

          <p><em>Knowledge and Library Services take the “heavy lifting” out of getting evidence into practice and give the “gift of time” to healthcare professionals. (key message 2, The Value Proposition</em></p>

          <p>As we reflect on 2020 within the Quality and Impact Group, the first thought might be that it was the year when not everything quite went to plan… However, a tremendous amount has been achieved and we have really been able to demonstrate the impact and value of our NHS knowledge and library services and specialists. In this blog we would like to highlight some of successes over the last 12 months and ongoing developments. We would also like to say a big THANK YOU to all those involved in workstream activities and for the knowledge and library staff continuing to identify and share stories of their impact and innovation.</p>

          <p>On 2<sup>nd</sup> November we launched our <em>Value Proposition; the gift of time</em> at an All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) meeting. The report explains how knowledge and library specialists in the NHS give the gift of time to busy healthcare professionals, taking the heavy lifting out of getting evidence into practice.</p>

          <p>Jacque Mallender of Economics by Design, who led the research, will be hosting two webinars to present the report in the new year. This is an opportunity to listen to the presentation provided at the APPG and to ask Jacque any questions.</p>

          <p><em>“The core value proposition is simple: The service provides healthcare professional staff with time-saving accelerated access to better quality evidence. This enables the NHS to meet its statutory obligations to utilize evidence from research. It enables healthcare professionals to use their time more effectively to drive improvements against the NHS quadruple aims” (key message 5, The Value Proposition</em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“Informed decisions improve outcomes, quality of care, patient experience, resource utilisation and operational efficiencies. This is best achieved when healthcare professionals are supported by the right knowledge services, with the right resources and with the right teams and roles” (Key message 3, The Value Proposition)</em></p>

          <p>We have continued throughout the year to receive your impact case studies, and over 100 of these have been approved. Working with our HEE communications team we have started to promote these more widely to stakeholders through <a href="https://twitter.com/NHS_HealthEdEng/status/1339118164567859200?s=20">twitter</a>, LinkedIn and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/hee-innovation-and-transformation/posts/?feedView=all">HEE Innovation and Transformation</a>. We are also now showcasing an impact case study on a monthly basis. Look out for the new format for the impact vignettes</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Case studies of high performing NHS Library and Knowledge Services demonstrate two key enablers for benefits realization: that the service has a clear strategic leadership role in knowledge management and mobilisation and is integrated with service delivery” (Key message 6, The Value Proposition)</em></p>

          <p>Although we had to change the submission dates, in the light of your work pressures during the pandemic, we are grateful to you all for completing the workforce and activity statistics this year. We are working to collate and analyse these and will be producing an infographics report of the key headlines. We are also working with our Business Intelligence team within HEE to develop a benchmarking dashboard based on a few key metrics. Again we plan to share this with you once completed.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>When supported by high-performing Library and Knowledge Services, NHS provider organisations are able to demonstrate how they are meeting their statutory obligations to use evidence to inform practice and hence improve their CQC rating (Key message 4 The Value Proposition)</em></p>

          <p>As we move into 2021, we anticipate that the baseline self-assessment of the new Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework will go ahead. We are currently reviewing the timelines and dates for submission whilst also looking at the longer-term process.</p>

          <p>Working with Amanda Stearn, we are in the process of updating <em>High Profile Health Libraries</em>, our toolkit to support advocacy. The newly updated toolkit will provide support materials, and hints and tips, to assist in positioning your service as business critical to your organisation(s).</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“Assuming findings from the international literature are applicable to the NHS, the service is potentially already generating an overall economic benefit of £132m per annum for the NHS, delivering a net economic benefit of £77m per annum. This could increase to £106m per annum were targe staff ratios for librarians achieved” (Key message 9, The Value Proposition)</em></p>

          <p>One of the outcomes for the quality and impact workstream is to promote knowledge and library service innovation and good practice. This year we were really pleased to see the outcome of our partnership working with CILIPs Library and Information Research Group (LIRG) to publish a special of the <a href="https://www.lirgjournal.org.uk/index.php/lir">LIR Journal on good practice in NHS-funded library and knowledge services</a>. Please do have a look at the good practice research and case study articles.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“There is growing and consistent body of robust international evidence to support this Value Proposition.” (Key message 7, The Value Proposition)</em></p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“Recently published research from the NHS suggests similar benefits may exist for the NHS” (Key message 8, The Value Proposition</em></p>

          <p>We have also been reflecting on the achievements of the Quality and Impact workstream over the last five years. Our case study article on the outcomes of the workstream <em>Quality Outcomes in NHS Library and Knowledge Services</em> has just been accepted by the Performance, Measurement and Metrics Journal. Please do look out for this in the new year.</p>

          <p>We would like to end by wishing you all a Merry Christmas.</p>

The report explains how knowledge and library specialists in the NHS give the gift of time to busy healthcare professionals, taking the heavy lifting out of getting evidence into practice.</p>

          <p>Jacque Mallender of Economics by Design, who led the research, will be hosting two webinars to present the report in the new year. This is an opportunity to listen to the presentation provided at the APPG and to ask Jacque any questions.</p>

          <p><em>“The core value proposition is simple: The service provides healthcare professional staff with time-saving accelerated access to better quality evidence. This enables the NHS to meet its statutory obligations to utilize evidence from research.

          <p>At the end of an extraordinary year when online resources and service delivery unexpectedly took on even more significance, this post highlights some of the developments within the Knowledge for Healthcare resource discovery workstream. None of these would have happened without the invaluable input of health library and knowledge services staff across the country.</p>

          <h3><strong>The COVID-19 Search Bank</strong></h3>

          <p>In March, librarians&nbsp;from across the regions rallied to create a <a href="coronavirus-search-bank">bank of peer-reviewed evidence searches</a> relating to coronavirus, with the shared aim of making the best use of specialist librarian skills and capacity at a crucial time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 200 searches and strategies have been shared to date. We will continue to build this resource into 2021. Learning from this will help inform future thinking about the value of sharing searches and peer review.</p>

          <h3><strong>Open Access </strong> <strong>and repositories</strong></h3>

          <p>The <a href="open-access-community-of-practice">Open Access CoP</a> thrived this year, with so many healthcare library staff involved in supporting open access and organisational repositories. HEE and NIHR jointly commissioned research into open access in the NHS and in October hosted a virtual round table on the topic for national bodies. There is clear appetite for joined-up policy and strategy. There is also interest in shared publishing platforms and repositories, so at the end of November, we were delighted to invite NHS library services to participate in a project to pilot a new shared NHS repository hosted by the British Library.</p>

          <h3><strong>Moving to using database provider interfaces</strong></h3>

          <p>Once the decision to <a href="national-systems">decommission HDAS</a> had been taken, we quickly started work on the next steps. As part of a portfolio of work, we were delighted to receive applications from eight library networks wishing to fast-track to using <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/supplier-databases">provider interfaces</a> and reference management software – and just sorry that we could only support four. The 120 staff and 33 services in these four pilot groups have gamely undertaken training and testing and provided feedback and are a pleasure to work with. Thank you!</p>

          <h3><strong>Moving to shared library management systems </strong></h3>

          <p>At the beginning of the year, HEE announced support for the plan to support the transition from over 90 local and legacy LMS to regionally shared LMS, fully funded by HEE. We all took a gulp: this makes sense in so many ways but won’t be easy. Library staff and users in the South West and North East already benefit from recently implemented shared LMS and, of course, we all know that system upgrades involved pains in order to achieve the gains.</p>

          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In September, we started engagement with library teams in the East of England and Kent, Surrey &amp; Sussex, the regions being supported to move forward next. Libraries in the Midlands, where there are already some locally shared LMS, are now considering what might work best for them. Participants in our HEE funded Senior Leadership Development Programme will be working with colleagues in the North and London to explore the benefits, opportunities and practicalities of shared LMS so that we can share the lessons learned.</p>

          <h3><strong>E-books</strong></h3>

          <p>Many library services reported an increase in demand for e-books this year. In May, HEE awarded Kortext a contract to offer <a href="content-governance">collaborative, credit-based e-book purchasing</a> for NHS library services in England. This has taken longer than hoped to mobilise. However, the HEE-funded titles chosen for each region are now accessible, and Kortext is open for business for local libraries wishing to work collaboratively to build on this collection.</p>

          <p><strong>BMJ Best Practice</strong></p>

          <p>In the second year of our national subscription to BMJ Best Practice, we’ve seen usage continue to rise. Thank you for everything you’ve done to promote the resource to your users. For example, at the outbreak of the pandemic, the team at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust promoted Best Practice as part of a carefully selected suite of knowledge resources suitable for trainees. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/info/covid-19-response-in-england-the-role-of-bmj-best-practice/">Analysis of usage in the following months showed that uptake in wave one was followed by sustained growth in use</a>. This year, we have worked closely with BMJ to create resources for inductions and to highlight the role that Best Practice patient information can play in health literacy and shared decision-making. These resources and more are available on the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/hee">BMJ/HEE landing page</a>. We’ve also worked with BMJ’s Clinical Engagement Lead and Health Informatician to integrate Best Practice into clinical workflows and organisation practices.</p>

          <h3><strong>Towards a new national website for LKS staff </strong></h3>

          <p>Lots of work has taken place behind the scenes this year to plan a new website for Library and Knowledge Services staff in England, to replace the current Knowledge for Healthcare blog, libraryservices.nhs.uk website and wiki. The national team has been busy updating and archiving existing content and making documents accessible. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the work to test the new website through alpha and beta phases.</p>

          <h3><strong>Towards a new national discovery service</strong></h3>

          <p>At the beginning of December, we announced that the contract for a <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/national-discovery-service">new national discovery service</a> for the NHS in England has been awarded to EBSCO EDS. Through the year we have developed the specification, undertaken a robust procurement and held virtual engagement sessions with library managers and staff. Our sincere thanks to everyone involved. The feedback and input you provided will be invaluable in helping to shape and develop the system to meet your needs and those of the health care workforce. Now the hard work really begins!</p>

          <p>Wishing you all the best for a happy and healthy festive season</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>At the end of an extraordinary year when online resources and service delivery unexpectedly took on even more significance, this post highlights some of the developments within the Knowledge for Healthcare resource discovery workstream. None of these would have happened without the invaluable input of health library and knowledge services staff across the country.</p>

          <h3><strong>The COVID-19 Search Bank</strong></h3>

          <p>In March, librarians&nbsp;from across the regions rallied to create a <a href="coronavirus-search-bank">bank of peer-reviewed evidence searches</a> relating to coronavirus, with the shared aim of making the best use of specialist librarian skills and capacity at a crucial time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 200 searches and strategies have been shared to date. We will continue to build this resource into 2021. Learning from this will help inform future thinking about the value of sharing searches and peer review.</p>

          <h3><strong>Open Access </strong> <strong>and repositories</strong></h3>

          <p>The <a href="open-access-community-of-practice">Open Access CoP</a> thrived this year, with so many healthcare library staff involved in supporting open access and organisational repositories. HEE and NIHR jointly commissioned research into open access in the NHS and in October hosted a virtual round table on the topic for national bodies. There is clear appetite for joined-up policy and strategy. There is also interest in shared publishing platforms and repositories, so at the end of November, we were delighted to invite NHS library services to participate in a project to pilot a new shared NHS repository hosted by the British Library.</p>

          <h3><strong>Moving to using database provider interfaces</strong></h3>

          <p>Once the decision to <a href="national-systems">decommission HDAS</a> had been taken, we quickly started work on the next steps. As part of a portfolio of work, we were delighted to receive applications from eight library networks wishing to fast-track to using <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/supplier-databases">provider interfaces</a> and reference management software – and just sorry that we could only support four. The 120 staff and 33 services in these four pilot groups have gamely undertaken training and testing and provided feedback and are a pleasure to work with. Thank you!</p>

          <h3><strong>Moving to shared library management systems </strong></h3>

          <p>At the beginning of the year, HEE announced support for the plan to support the transition from over 90 local and legacy LMS to regionally shared LMS, fully funded by HEE. We all took a gulp: this makes sense in so many ways but won’t be easy. Library staff and users in the South West and North East already benefit from recently implemented shared LMS and, of course, we all know that system upgrades involved pains in order to achieve the gains.</p>

          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In September, we started engagement with library teams in the East of England and Kent, Surrey &amp; Sussex, the regions being supported to move forward next. Libraries in the Midlands, where there are already some locally shared LMS, are now considering what might work best for them. Participants in our HEE funded Senior Leadership Development Programme will be working with colleagues in the North and London to explore the benefits, opportunities and practicalities of shared LMS so that we can share the lessons learned.</p>

          <h3><strong>E-books</strong></h3>

          <p>Many library services reported an increase in demand for e-books this year. In May, HEE awarded Kortext a contract to offer <a href="content-governance">collaborative, credit-based e-book purchasing</a> for NHS library services in England. This has taken longer than hoped to mobilise. However, the HEE-funded titles chosen for each region are now accessible, and Kortext is open for business for local libraries wishing to work collaboratively to build on this collection.</p>

          <p><strong>BMJ Best Practice</strong></p>

          <p>In the second year of our national subscription to BMJ Best Practice, we’ve seen usage continue to rise. Thank you for everything you’ve done to promote the resource to your users. For example, at the outbreak of the pandemic, the team at Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust promoted Best Practice as part of a carefully selected suite of knowledge resources suitable for trainees. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/info/covid-19-response-in-england-the-role-of-bmj-best-practice/">Analysis of usage in the following months showed that uptake in wave one was followed by sustained growth in use</a>. This year, we have worked closely with BMJ to create resources for inductions and to highlight the role that Best Practice patient information can play in health literacy and shared decision-making. These resources and more are available on the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/hee">BMJ/HEE landing page</a>. We’ve also worked with BMJ’s Clinical Engagement Lead and Health Informatician to integrate Best Practice into clinical workflows and organisation practices.</p>

          <h3><strong>Towards a new national website for LKS staff </strong></h3>

          <p>Lots of work has taken place behind the scenes this year to plan a new website for Library and Knowledge Services staff in England, to replace the current Knowledge for Healthcare blog, libraryservices.nhs.uk website and wiki. The national team has been busy updating and archiving existing content and making documents accessible. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the work to test the new website through alpha and beta phases.</p>

          <h3><strong>Towards a new national discovery service</strong></h3>

          <p>At the beginning of December, we announced that the contract for a <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/national-discovery-service">new national discovery service</a> for the NHS in England has been awarded to EBSCO EDS. Through the year we have developed the specification, undertaken a robust procurement and held virtual engagement sessions with library managers and staff. Our sincere thanks to everyone involved. The feedback and input you provided will be invaluable in helping to shape and develop the system to meet your needs and those of the health care workforce. Now the hard work really begins!</p>

          <p>Wishing you all the best for a happy and healthy festive season</p>

          <p>In the SWIMS Network we’ve recently put fining for overdue items under the spotlight. We’ve been looking into whether SWIMS Network library services charge fines or not, and their reasons, and also trends in library fining generally.</p>

          <p>Here’s why we did that, and what we found out.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In March 2020 we&nbsp;went live with&nbsp;a&nbsp;replacement&nbsp;regional&nbsp;library management system. A&nbsp;new system needs&nbsp;a lot of configuration, and with limited capacity available&nbsp;we need&nbsp;to&nbsp;decide priorities for&nbsp;the&nbsp;work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of&nbsp;the configuration&nbsp;work&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;all library staff and end users,&nbsp;and so this is&nbsp;our highest priority,&nbsp;but some libraries request local&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these&nbsp;is management of fines, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;small number of&nbsp;our&nbsp;libraries charge fines for overdue items.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>It became clear that configuring the system for fines management&nbsp;would require a fair amount of work,&nbsp;which&nbsp;prompted us to&nbsp;review library fining&nbsp;generally.&nbsp; We carried out a survey of our 29 library services.&nbsp; How many libraries&nbsp;charge&nbsp;fines?&nbsp; What are their reasons?&nbsp; Have any stopped recently, and if&nbsp;so&nbsp;have they noticed any consequences?&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;also&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;literature reviews on the subject.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A literature review carried out&nbsp;for&nbsp;the BASE Patch1&nbsp;in the West Midlands&nbsp;in 2019&nbsp;didn’t find any&nbsp;particular&nbsp;trend&nbsp;in health libraries;&nbsp;however&nbsp;it did reveal&nbsp;a trend away from charging fines in&nbsp;both public and higher education&nbsp;libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>An update to that review carried out by the Health Education&nbsp;England&nbsp;Knowledge Management team in 20202&nbsp;confirmed this&nbsp;trend away from library fining.&nbsp;The review summarised&nbsp;a number&nbsp;of&nbsp;arguments&nbsp;in the literature&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>charging fines:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>they are discriminatory from a socioeconomic&nbsp;angle;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>they are&nbsp;unnecessary membership barriers</li>
           <li>they are&nbsp;bad for reputational risk especially if seen as income generation (even if there is re-investment in resources). &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The review concluded that it is&nbsp;hard to see a case for them. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>These arguments&nbsp;were&nbsp;also reflected&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;results of&nbsp;a&nbsp;2020&nbsp;survey of libraries in the SWIMS Network.&nbsp; Reasons not to fine&nbsp;or to stop fining&nbsp;also&nbsp;included:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>These arguments &nbsp; were&nbsp; also reflected&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; results of&nbsp; a &nbsp; 2020&nbsp; survey of libraries in the SWIMS Network .&nbsp; R easons not to fine&nbsp; or to stop fining&nbsp; also&nbsp; included: &nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>they can&nbsp;jeopardise&nbsp;customer relations&nbsp;and&nbsp;staff&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel uncomfortable&nbsp;imposing them</li>
           <li>they incur administrative burden and cost including of having a&nbsp;cash register</li>
           <li>they may&nbsp;deter people accessing resources they need&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>they may&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;as&nbsp;some kind of fee&nbsp;to use the service so actually encourage&nbsp;users&nbsp;to keep items longer</li>
           <li>they&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;in line with trust guidelines&nbsp;</li>
           <li>with increasing use of cashless payments&nbsp;– especially&nbsp;in light of&nbsp;coronavirus –&nbsp;there is a barrier to collection for libraries without the necessary technology&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Reasons to fine included:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>they&nbsp;encourage people to return their books in good time so that they circulate&nbsp;</li>
           <li>they generate some income&nbsp;</li>
           <li>historical reasons&nbsp;(unspecified!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Both libraries which fine and those which don’t mentioned&nbsp;the need to consider&nbsp;alignment&nbsp;with other services in the locality,&nbsp;including higher education&nbsp;libraries. However, a further consideration with regionally-shared NHS library managements system like ours&nbsp;– which enable users to&nbsp;easily&nbsp;move between library services&nbsp;as they move between employers – is the&nbsp;administrative complexity&nbsp;involved where users with&nbsp;outstanding fines move to libraries which don’t fine.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Neither&nbsp;the literature&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;nor the survey&nbsp;provided&nbsp;any&nbsp;concrete evidence&nbsp;for the benefits of fining, either on&nbsp;stock circulation or user relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of impact on stopping fining, one comment from the SWIMS Network survey&nbsp;stands out:&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“Along with letting people eat in the library</em> long with letting people eat in the library <em>,</em><em>&nbsp;it’s one of the best thi</em>ngs<em>&nbsp;we’ve ever done</em> gs we’ve ever done.<em>”</em></p>

          <p>We would be interested to know if&nbsp;colleagues in different parts of the country have differing views on this&nbsp;question!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In the SWIMS Network we’ve recently put fining for overdue items under the spotlight. We’ve been looking into whether SWIMS Network library services charge fines or not, and their reasons, and also trends in library fining generally.</p>

          <p>Here’s why we did that, and what we found out.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In March 2020 we&nbsp;went live with&nbsp;a&nbsp;replacement&nbsp;regional&nbsp;library management system. A&nbsp;new system needs&nbsp;a lot of configuration, and with limited capacity available&nbsp;we need&nbsp;to&nbsp;decide priorities for&nbsp;the&nbsp;work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of&nbsp;the configuration&nbsp;work&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;all library staff and end users,&nbsp;and so this is&nbsp;our highest priority,&nbsp;but some libraries request local&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of these&nbsp;is management of fines, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;small number of&nbsp;our&nbsp;libraries charge fines for overdue items.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>It became clear that configuring the system for fines management&nbsp;would require a fair amount of work,&nbsp;which&nbsp;prompted us to&nbsp;review library fining&nbsp;generally.&nbsp; We carried out a survey of our 29 library services.&nbsp; How many libraries&nbsp;charge&nbsp;fines?&nbsp; What are their reasons?&nbsp; Have any stopped recently, and if&nbsp;so&nbsp;have they noticed any consequences?&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;also&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;literature reviews on the subject.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A literature review carried out&nbsp;for&nbsp;the BASE Patch1&nbsp;in the West Midlands&nbsp;in 2019&nbsp;didn’t find any&nbsp;particular&nbsp;trend&nbsp;in health libraries;&nbsp;however&nbsp;it did reveal&nbsp;a trend away from charging fines in&nbsp;both public and higher education&nbsp;libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>An update to that review carried out by the Health Education&nbsp;England&nbsp;Knowledge Management team in 20202&nbsp;confirmed this&nbsp;trend away from library fining.&nbsp;The review summarised&nbsp;a number&nbsp;of&nbsp;arguments&nbsp;in the literature&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>charging fines:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>they are discriminatory from a socioeconomic&nbsp;angle;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>they are&nbsp;unnecessary membership barriers</li>
           <li>they are&nbsp;bad for reputational risk especially if seen as income generation (even if there is re-investment in resources). &nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The review concluded that it is&nbsp;hard to see a case for them. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>These arguments&nbsp;were&nbsp;also reflected&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;results of&nbsp;a&nbsp;2020&nbsp;survey of libraries in the SWIMS Network.&nbsp; Reasons not to fine&nbsp;or to stop fining&nbsp;also&nbsp;included:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>These arguments &nbsp; were&nbsp; also reflected&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; results of&nbsp; a &nbsp; 2020&nbsp; survey of libraries in the SWIMS Network .&nbsp; R easons not to fine&nbsp; or to stop fining&nbsp; also&nbsp; included: &nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>they can&nbsp;jeopardise&nbsp;customer relations&nbsp;and&nbsp;staff&nbsp;can&nbsp;feel uncomfortable&nbsp;imposing them</li>
           <li>they incur administrative burden and cost including of having a&nbsp;cash register</li>
           <li>they may&nbsp;deter people accessing resources they need&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
           <li>they may&nbsp;be seen&nbsp;as&nbsp;some kind of fee&nbsp;to use the service so actually encourage&nbsp;users&nbsp;to keep items longer</li>
           <li>they&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;in line with trust guidelines&nbsp;</li>
           <li>with increasing use of cashless payments&nbsp;– especially&nbsp;in light of&nbsp;coronavirus –&nbsp;there is a barrier to collection for libraries without the necessary technology&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Reasons to fine included:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>they&nbsp;encourage people to return their books in good time so that they circulate&nbsp;</li>
           <li>they generate some income&nbsp;</li>
           <li>historical reasons&nbsp;(unspecified!)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Both libraries which fine and those which don’t mentioned&nbsp;the need to consider&nbsp;alignment&nbsp;with other services in the locality,&nbsp;including higher education&nbsp;libraries. However, a further consideration with regionally-shared NHS library managements system like ours&nbsp;– which enable users to&nbsp;easily&nbsp;move between library services&nbsp;as they move between employers – is the&nbsp;administrative complexity&nbsp;involved where users with&nbsp;outstanding fines move to libraries which don’t fine.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Neither&nbsp;the literature&nbsp;reviews&nbsp;nor the survey&nbsp;provided&nbsp;any&nbsp;concrete evidence&nbsp;for the benefits of fining, either on&nbsp;stock circulation or user relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of impact on stopping fining, one comment from the SWIMS Network survey&nbsp;stands out:&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px"><em>“Along with letting people eat in the library</em> long with letting people eat in the library <em>,</em><em>&nbsp;it’s one of the best thi</em>ngs<em>&nbsp;we’ve ever done</em> gs we’ve ever done.<em>”</em></p>

          <p>We would be interested to know if&nbsp;colleagues in different parts of the country have differing views on this&nbsp;question!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>2020 has been an extraordinary year. Covid-19 has presented many challenges, particularly in phase one, including redeployment of library staff and space, IT connectivity to allow working from home and the development of virtual and digital services. However, library and knowledge staff have risen to meet and overcome these challenges, demonstrating resilience and adaptability. Messaging throughout the pandemic has been that library and knowledge staff are accessible and services have remained open for business, even if the doors to some physical spaces have been closed.</p>

          <p>The role that library and knowledge specialists play in mobilising knowledge and evidence into practice has supported individual and organisational learning and Covid-19 decision making. This has raised the profile of library and knowledge services in many organisations.</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Library and knowledge service managers working for the Trusts leading the Nightingales, developed tailored service offers into the new hospitals. The national HEE library and knowledge services LKS team has worked with this group of service managers to facilitate a community of practice to support learning and sharing.</li>
           <li>Services have provided evidence support for Boards and supported the management of incidents by gold and silver command groups by delivering rapid evidence reviews.</li>
           <li>Library and knowledge staff have used knowledge management tools to facilitate discussions and share learning for example, using After-Action Reviews to capture lessons learned and running Randomised Coffee Trials to share learning and keep staff connected.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Across the networks, we have seen greater collaborative working between services, for example through the sharing of expertise and supporting colleagues where capacity has been reduced. Collaborative working has also resulted sharing examples of <a href="coronavirus-current-awareness_1">Covid current awareness sharing bulletins</a> and in the development of the <a href="search-bank_1">Covid-19 Search Bank</a>. Since the launch of the Search Bank in May, over 200 search strings and strategies have been published. Feedback from participants and users has been very positive and we are looking at what this experience can tell us about supporting expert searchers.</p>

          <p>There has been a move to making greater use of technology, strengthening delivery of virtual services, including training, demonstrating a capability for rapid and agile development. Most services are now offering some type of virtual training session, and there are examples of development of online and e-learning modules to support induction and critical appraisal. The national CPD offers to develop skills in facilitating virtual meetings have been well received by library and knowledge staff.</p>

          <p>The HEE Resource Discovery team has supported remote working by ensuring off-site access to OpenAthens administration tools. They also optimised access to the evidence-base by collating trusted evidence resources, with sources on the vaccine currently being pulled together, and signposting developments with BMJ Best Practice and access to e-books through the Kortext platform.</p>

          <p>Library and knowledge staff have continued to provide knowledge services remotely throughout the pandemic. In May, 45% of our physical library services were either closed or open but not staffed. By October 20 this had reduced to just 11%. All services have worked with their organisations to adapt both the working and learning space within the library to ensure it is safe. Many of you have shared your approach, together with pictures of the changes including:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>changes in layout for PC and study space</li>
           <li>self-issuing systems</li>
           <li>screens around library counters</li>
           <li>booking systems for workstations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some services have added to the ways in which the library is valued by NHS staff as a wellbeing resource, creating and expanding the health and wellbeing space and collections for staff.</p>

          <p>We are aware that there is pressure on library space in some organisations. Accordingly, we have prepared policy recommendations that emphasise the importance of library learning space, which will go to the HEE Executive for approval in January 2021.</p>

          <p>Over the last few weeks HEE’s library and knowledge service regional teams have been ringing everyone. It has been good to catch up with you and find out what is currently happening in your services and organisations during the second wave. We will be considering all the feedback to identify any themes where areas for further support or training have been raised. In talking to you all it has been amazing to hear that, despite the challenges faced, many of you are still seeking out the opportunities in your organisations and continuing to develop the service through innovation and adopting good practice.</p>

          <p>During the pandemic, services have captured some amazing impact stories which we are delighted to share some with you here. Working with the HEE Communications team, we have been using these to raise the profile of NHS library and knowledge services on social media. Please do continue to collect your impact case studies and share them with us.</p>

          <p>We would like to finish this blogpost with thanks to you. Your work in mobilising evidence and knowledge to support Covid-19 decision making, supporting the health and wellbeing of NHS staff, and ensuring that accessible, evidence-based health information is made available for patients and the public, has made all for the difference to many lives during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>2020 has been an extraordinary year. Covid-19 has presented many challenges, particularly in phase one, including redeployment of library staff and space, IT connectivity to allow working from home and the development of virtual and digital services. However, library and knowledge staff have risen to meet and overcome these challenges, demonstrating resilience and adaptability. Messaging throughout the pandemic has been that library and knowledge staff are accessible and services have remained open for business, even if the doors to some physical spaces have been closed.</p>

          <p>The role that library and knowledge specialists play in mobilising knowledge and evidence into practice has supported individual and organisational learning and Covid-19 decision making. This has raised the profile of library and knowledge services in many organisations.</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Library and knowledge service managers working for the Trusts leading the Nightingales, developed tailored service offers into the new hospitals. The national HEE library and knowledge services LKS team has worked with this group of service managers to facilitate a community of practice to support learning and sharing.</li>
           <li>Services have provided evidence support for Boards and supported the management of incidents by gold and silver command groups by delivering rapid evidence reviews.</li>
           <li>Library and knowledge staff have used knowledge management tools to facilitate discussions and share learning for example, using After-Action Reviews to capture lessons learned and running Randomised Coffee Trials to share learning and keep staff connected.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Across the networks, we have seen greater collaborative working between services, for example through the sharing of expertise and supporting colleagues where capacity has been reduced. Collaborative working has also resulted sharing examples of <a href="coronavirus-current-awareness_1">Covid current awareness sharing bulletins</a> and in the development of the <a href="search-bank_1">Covid-19 Search Bank</a>. Since the launch of the Search Bank in May, over 200 search strings and strategies have been published. Feedback from participants and users has been very positive and we are looking at what this experience can tell us about supporting expert searchers.</p>

          <p>There has been a move to making greater use of technology, strengthening delivery of virtual services, including training, demonstrating a capability for rapid and agile development. Most services are now offering some type of virtual training session, and there are examples of development of online and e-learning modules to support induction and critical appraisal. The national CPD offers to develop skills in facilitating virtual meetings have been well received by library and knowledge staff.</p>

          <p>The HEE Resource Discovery team has supported remote working by ensuring off-site access to OpenAthens administration tools. They also optimised access to the evidence-base by collating trusted evidence resources, with sources on the vaccine currently being pulled together, and signposting developments with BMJ Best Practice and access to e-books through the Kortext platform.</p>

          <p>Library and knowledge staff have continued to provide knowledge services remotely throughout the pandemic. In May, 45% of our physical library services were either closed or open but not staffed. By October 20 this had reduced to just 11%. All services have worked with their organisations to adapt both the working and learning space within the library to ensure it is safe. Many of you have shared your approach, together with pictures of the changes including:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>changes in layout for PC and study space</li>
           <li>self-issuing systems</li>
           <li>screens around library counters</li>
           <li>booking systems for workstations.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some services have added to the ways in which the library is valued by NHS staff as a wellbeing resource, creating and expanding the health and wellbeing space and collections for staff.</p>

          <p>We are aware that there is pressure on library space in some organisations. Accordingly, we have prepared policy recommendations that emphasise the importance of library learning space, which will go to the HEE Executive for approval in January 2021.</p>

          <p>Over the last few weeks HEE’s library and knowledge service regional teams have been ringing everyone. It has been good to catch up with you and find out what is currently happening in your services and organisations during the second wave. We will be considering all the feedback to identify any themes where areas for further support or training have been raised. In talking to you all it has been amazing to hear that, despite the challenges faced, many of you are still seeking out the opportunities in your organisations and continuing to develop the service through innovation and adopting good practice.</p>

          <p>During the pandemic, services have captured some amazing impact stories which we are delighted to share some with you here. Working with the HEE Communications team, we have been using these to raise the profile of NHS library and knowledge services on social media. Please do continue to collect your impact case studies and share them with us.</p>

          <p>We would like to finish this blogpost with thanks to you. Your work in mobilising evidence and knowledge to support Covid-19 decision making, supporting the health and wellbeing of NHS staff, and ensuring that accessible, evidence-based health information is made available for patients and the public, has made all for the difference to many lives during the pandemic.</p>

          <p><em>“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.”</em> <strong>Søren Kierkegaard</strong></p>

          <p>As we come to end of 2020 and look forward to a new year of opportunities, building on the great work already done, it is a good time to reflect on all that has been achieved in the health literacy and patient information workstream since 2016.</p>

          <p>In our first blog posting, Carol-Ann Regan and Natasha Howard described <a href="stps-and-patient-information">how approaching senior stakeholders in their Trusts had led to the development of work to support patient information</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Those initial conversations led to the development of a toolkit of ideas to help us all to make the case and understand the drivers for librarians and knowledge specialists to support patient information. Good practice was also shared in the Ideas Bank. Different ways of supporting patient information were identified, from providing evidence for patient information leaflets, signposting information accessible to all and training volunteers and healthcare professionals to find quality, evidence-based information online.</p>

          <p>Although we have a key role in supporting patient information, partnership working with other information providers, healthcare professionals and organisations is needed. In 2018/19, a group taking the Health Education England funded CILIP Leadership Development Programme formed a Health Information Team. With representatives from Trusts, NICE, Public Health England and the voluntary sector, they worked together to develop a <a href="new-resources-for-health-information-week-2018">regional initiative called Health Information Week into a national one</a>.</p>

          <p>Different health information teams have worked to support us and in 2020 our “do once and share” approach saw a new <a href="health-information-week-2020-hiw2020--have-your-sa">logo and branding, poster templates, and a social media toolkit – quick and easy ways to enable us all to participate. Health Information Week in July is now part of our yearly calendars</a>.</p>

          <p>In 2018, we began to prioritise raising awareness of the importance of Health literacy amongst the healthcare workforce, enabling them to recognise the impact that low health literacy has for patients, carers and our healthcare system. The key statistics show <strong>43% adults aged 16-65 </strong>do not understand words-based health information sufficiently well to act on it; when numbers are added, <strong>61% adults aged 16-65</strong> do not understand. Truly shocking statistics which have implications for both individuals and the health system. <a href="health-literacy-underpinned-by-digital-literacy-fo">Health literacy month in October is also a fixture in our calendar each year and exciting things are planned in the next 5 year</a>s</p>

          <p>Our lives have changed hugely since the start of 2020. Reflecting on the changes, participants in the HEE funded Senior Leadership Development programme described how <em>“</em><em>Health hasn’t been just the primary concern for health and care professionals or those individuals with health conditions, it has been the predominant topic for everybody globally.”</em> This blog encourages us all to <a href="one-year-on-a-global-pandemic-highlights-the-impor">share examples where we have supported patients and healthcare professionals during the pandemic</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Our key role to support patients and colleagues to be health literate, to make best use of health information and the health service, is even more pressing. The shortlisting of the coronavirus resources site for an HSJ award is amazing <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources">https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources</a></p>

          <p>Alongside our roles in health literacy and patient information, we have also been proactive in providing resources to support the health and wellbeing of all: an ever-growing and ever-more important resource. Look out for further news in 2021.</p>

          <p>There is a huge amount to celebrate and be proud of as we have adapted, upskilled, and collaborated. If you want to know more please contact Ruth Carlyle or Sue Robertson.</p>

          <p><em>“Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.”</em> <strong>Søren Kierkegaard</strong></p>

          <p>As we come to end of 2020 and look forward to a new year of opportunities, building on the great work already done, it is a good time to reflect on all that has been achieved in the health literacy and patient information workstream since 2016.</p>

          <p>In our first blog posting, Carol-Ann Regan and Natasha Howard described <a href="stps-and-patient-information">how approaching senior stakeholders in their Trusts had led to the development of work to support patient information</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Those initial conversations led to the development of a toolkit of ideas to help us all to make the case and understand the drivers for librarians and knowledge specialists to support patient information. Good practice was also shared in the Ideas Bank. Different ways of supporting patient information were identified, from providing evidence for patient information leaflets, signposting information accessible to all and training volunteers and healthcare professionals to find quality, evidence-based information online.</p>

          <p>Although we have a key role in supporting patient information, partnership working with other information providers, healthcare professionals and organisations is needed. In 2018/19, a group taking the Health Education England funded CILIP Leadership Development Programme formed a Health Information Team. With representatives from Trusts, NICE, Public Health England and the voluntary sector, they worked together to develop a <a href="new-resources-for-health-information-week-2018">regional initiative called Health Information Week into a national one</a>.</p>

          <p>Different health information teams have worked to support us and in 2020 our “do once and share” approach saw a new <a href="health-information-week-2020-hiw2020--have-your-sa">logo and branding, poster templates, and a social media toolkit – quick and easy ways to enable us all to participate. Health Information Week in July is now part of our yearly calendars</a>.</p>

          <p>In 2018, we began to prioritise raising awareness of the importance of Health literacy amongst the healthcare workforce, enabling them to recognise the impact that low health literacy has for patients, carers and our healthcare system. The key statistics show <strong>43% adults aged 16-65 </strong>do not understand words-based health information sufficiently well to act on it; when numbers are added, <strong>61% adults aged 16-65</strong> do not understand. Truly shocking statistics which have implications for both individuals and the health system. <a href="health-literacy-underpinned-by-digital-literacy-fo">Health literacy month in October is also a fixture in our calendar each year and exciting things are planned in the next 5 year</a>s</p>

          <p>Our lives have changed hugely since the start of 2020. Reflecting on the changes, participants in the HEE funded Senior Leadership Development programme described how <em>“</em><em>Health hasn’t been just the primary concern for health and care professionals or those individuals with health conditions, it has been the predominant topic for everybody globally.”</em> This blog encourages us all to <a href="one-year-on-a-global-pandemic-highlights-the-impor">share examples where we have supported patients and healthcare professionals during the pandemic</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Our key role to support patients and colleagues to be health literate, to make best use of health information and the health service, is even more pressing. The shortlisting of the coronavirus resources site for an HSJ award is amazing <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources">https://library.nhs.uk/coronavirus-resources</a></p>

          <p>Alongside our roles in health literacy and patient information, we have also been proactive in providing resources to support the health and wellbeing of all: an ever-growing and ever-more important resource. Look out for further news in 2021.</p>

          <p>There is a huge amount to celebrate and be proud of as we have adapted, upskilled, and collaborated. If you want to know more please contact Ruth Carlyle or Sue Robertson.</p>

          <p>In mid-September HEE began a pilot to understand how best to help LKS in England move from using HDAS to using provider interfaces (EBSCOhost, Proquest and Ovid).</p>

          <p>The Expert Search Early Adopters pilot is now nearly two months in, and the following is an update of how the project is progressing, along with some detail around what will happen over the next few months.</p>

          <p>There are four early adopter groups, which are roughly aligned to regional geographies: Greater Manchester, East Midlands, East of England, and Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 33 LKS are taking part with approximately 120 staff involved in total in the pilot. There’s a wide mix of experience across the groups, with some services frequently using provider interfaces to search and others rarely setting foot outside of HDAS.</p>

          <p>Training sessions have been delivered to pilot participants by Proquest, EBSCOhost and Ovid. Cambridge University Medical Library have also run sessions for staff as they have extensive experience of using provider interfaces for searching and wanted to share their knowledge with peers.</p>

          <p>Those services without reference management software in place were offered licences for Endnote, and a subscription to Refworks is also available to all participants. The two products use different distribution models (Endnote requires individual licences and software needs downloading onto PCs, whereas Refworks is web based) as the pilot needs to evaluate ease of access and stability as well as the functionality of reference management software. Participants are also being encouraged to use freely available reference management tools such as Zotero and Mendeley if they wish.</p>

          <p>To date there have been three different stages of data collection: an initial baseline participant survey, which collected some demographic info and asked people to think about the potential challenges and benefits of switching to provider interfaces, a phase one baseline search data collection survey (pre-switch) and a phase two search data collection survey (post-switch). It was hoped that participants in the pilot would be able to switch from using HDAS in October, but for a variety of reasons this has been moved to early November.</p>

          <p>84 participants completed the initial baseline participant survey. 69% of respondents had 5 or more years searching experience, with 52% carrying out between 1 and 3 searches a week, and 10% carrying out between 4 and 6 searches a week. Participants were asked: <em>What do you expect to be the greatest challenges of moving away from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em> Responses were analysed for themes and six were identified, in order of frequency:</p>

          <p><em>What do you expect to be the greatest challenges of moving away from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em></p>

          <ul>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to search results</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to using new products</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to helping library users</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to time</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to provider interfaces</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to using multiple interfaces</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Participants were also asked: <em>What do you foresee as the biggest potential benefits of moving from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em> For this question there were nine themes identified, listed below in order of frequency:</p>

          <p><em>What do you foresee as the biggest potential benefits of moving from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em></p>

          <ul>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to stability of the search interface</em></li>
           <li><em>No benefits</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to search results</em></li>
           <li><em>Currently unsure of benefits</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to the skills of library staff</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to library users</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to the development and improvement of interfaces</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to reference management software</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to the functionality of interfaces</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p>During the evaluation stage of the project, which will be towards the end of this year and the start of the next, participants will be asked about the training provided, reference management experiences and revisiting what they thought would be the potential challenges and benefits of switching. The information we collect about searches carried out pre and post switch will be examined to ascertain the impact on the time it takes to carry out a search, and identify any specific issues with the search process. All of the resulting data will be used to help shape the rollout of training and support for the rest of the LKS in England.</p>

          <p>In mid-September HEE began a pilot to understand how best to help LKS in England move from using HDAS to using provider interfaces (EBSCOhost, Proquest and Ovid).</p>

          <p>The Expert Search Early Adopters pilot is now nearly two months in, and the following is an update of how the project is progressing, along with some detail around what will happen over the next few months.</p>

          <p>There are four early adopter groups, which are roughly aligned to regional geographies: Greater Manchester, East Midlands, East of England, and Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 33 LKS are taking part with approximately 120 staff involved in total in the pilot. There’s a wide mix of experience across the groups, with some services frequently using provider interfaces to search and others rarely setting foot outside of HDAS.</p>

          <p>Training sessions have been delivered to pilot participants by Proquest, EBSCOhost and Ovid. Cambridge University Medical Library have also run sessions for staff as they have extensive experience of using provider interfaces for searching and wanted to share their knowledge with peers.</p>

          <p>Those services without reference management software in place were offered licences for Endnote, and a subscription to Refworks is also available to all participants. The two products use different distribution models (Endnote requires individual licences and software needs downloading onto PCs, whereas Refworks is web based) as the pilot needs to evaluate ease of access and stability as well as the functionality of reference management software. Participants are also being encouraged to use freely available reference management tools such as Zotero and Mendeley if they wish.</p>

          <p>To date there have been three different stages of data collection: an initial baseline participant survey, which collected some demographic info and asked people to think about the potential challenges and benefits of switching to provider interfaces, a phase one baseline search data collection survey (pre-switch) and a phase two search data collection survey (post-switch). It was hoped that participants in the pilot would be able to switch from using HDAS in October, but for a variety of reasons this has been moved to early November.</p>

          <p>84 participants completed the initial baseline participant survey. 69% of respondents had 5 or more years searching experience, with 52% carrying out between 1 and 3 searches a week, and 10% carrying out between 4 and 6 searches a week. Participants were asked: <em>What do you expect to be the greatest challenges of moving away from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em> Responses were analysed for themes and six were identified, in order of frequency:</p>

          <p><em>What do you expect to be the greatest challenges of moving away from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em></p>

          <ul>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to search results</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to using new products</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to helping library users</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to time</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to provider interfaces</em></li>
           <li><em>Challenges relating to using multiple interfaces</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Participants were also asked: <em>What do you foresee as the biggest potential benefits of moving from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em> For this question there were nine themes identified, listed below in order of frequency:</p>

          <p><em>What do you foresee as the biggest potential benefits of moving from HDAS to provider interfaces?</em></p>

          <ul>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to stability of the search interface</em></li>
           <li><em>No benefits</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to search results</em></li>
           <li><em>Currently unsure of benefits</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to the skills of library staff</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to library users</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to the development and improvement of interfaces</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to reference management software</em></li>
           <li><em>Benefits relating to the functionality of interfaces</em></li>
          </ul>

          <p>During the evaluation stage of the project, which will be towards the end of this year and the start of the next, participants will be asked about the training provided, reference management experiences and revisiting what they thought would be the potential challenges and benefits of switching. The information we collect about searches carried out pre and post switch will be examined to ascertain the impact on the time it takes to carry out a search, and identify any specific issues with the search process. All of the resulting data will be used to help shape the rollout of training and support for the rest of the LKS in England.</p>

          <p>In mid-September HEE began a pilot to understand how best to help LKS in England move from using HDAS to using provider interfaces (EBSCOhost, Proquest and Ovid).</p>

          <p>Phase one of data collection ended in November 2020 and we’re able to share some of the results from our survey around pre-switch searches (carried out primarily on HDAS). This was undertaken to capture ‘normal’ search behaviour, so we could do some comparing and contrasting with searches carried out on provider interfaces after the pilot groups switched. The data collected is a great snapshot of search activity and is fascinating reading if you’re interested in search behaviour.</p>

          <p>We had 68 searches recorded during this phase. We asked participants to briefly describe their search – purpose, level of complexity etc. As expected, topics were wide ranging and search requesters were from a multitude of staff groups.</p>

          <p>The most frequently used resources were HDAS Medline (76% of searches), HDAS CINAHL (63% of searches) and HDAS EMBASE (50% of searches). Results were collated using reference management for 13% of searches, and Endnote Desktop was the most frequently used reference management tool.</p>

          <p>Exactly 50% of searches were completed in a single session and the other 50% over multiple sessions. The time it took to complete a search varied wildly, with the shortest taking just 20 minutes and the longest 15 hours – this was a search to support a systematic review. There were two searches captured that fitted into the systematic review category, and as their times vastly skewed the average search time they were removed from calculations. With the remaining 66 searches the average time to complete was 2 hours 51 minutes, with most taking between 1-2 hours or 2-3 hours (44% and 29% respectively).</p>

          <p>We asked participants to tell us what had gone well with their search, what didn’t go so well, and what changes could be made to improve their search experience. Things that worked well included being able to search multiple resources without switching interfaces, being able to collate results and search history into one document for the search requester, and searches where the topic was straightforward and therefor easy to find results for. There were common issues around glitches in HDAS, de-duplicating results and the search topic either proving difficult to search for, or being outside of the scope of the databases available to the searcher. Possible improvements included increased stability (fewer interface glitches), less scrolling and a cleaner interface, and having access to reference management software to de-duplicate and collate results.</p>

          <p>Finally we asked people to rate their search experience a star rating, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent. The average rating was 3.7, with 34% rating 3 stars, 42% rating 4 stars and 21% rating 5 stars.</p>

          <p>Phase two of data collection is now well under way, and we are asking participants to fill out a similar survey for any searches they carry out on one specific day of their working week. We’ll be sharing the results from this phase over the next few months.</p>

          <p>In mid-September HEE began a pilot to understand how best to help LKS in England move from using HDAS to using provider interfaces (EBSCOhost, Proquest and Ovid).</p>

          <p>Phase one of data collection ended in November 2020 and we’re able to share some of the results from our survey around pre-switch searches (carried out primarily on HDAS). This was undertaken to capture ‘normal’ search behaviour, so we could do some comparing and contrasting with searches carried out on provider interfaces after the pilot groups switched. The data collected is a great snapshot of search activity and is fascinating reading if you’re interested in search behaviour.</p>

          <p>We had 68 searches recorded during this phase. We asked participants to briefly describe their search – purpose, level of complexity etc. As expected, topics were wide ranging and search requesters were from a multitude of staff groups.</p>

          <p>The most frequently used resources were HDAS Medline (76% of searches), HDAS CINAHL (63% of searches) and HDAS EMBASE (50% of searches). Results were collated using reference management for 13% of searches, and Endnote Desktop was the most frequently used reference management tool.</p>

          <p>Exactly 50% of searches were completed in a single session and the other 50% over multiple sessions. The time it took to complete a search varied wildly, with the shortest taking just 20 minutes and the longest 15 hours – this was a search to support a systematic review. There were two searches captured that fitted into the systematic review category, and as their times vastly skewed the average search time they were removed from calculations. With the remaining 66 searches the average time to complete was 2 hours 51 minutes, with most taking between 1-2 hours or 2-3 hours (44% and 29% respectively).</p>

          <p>We asked participants to tell us what had gone well with their search, what didn’t go so well, and what changes could be made to improve their search experience. Things that worked well included being able to search multiple resources without switching interfaces, being able to collate results and search history into one document for the search requester, and searches where the topic was straightforward and therefor easy to find results for. There were common issues around glitches in HDAS, de-duplicating results and the search topic either proving difficult to search for, or being outside of the scope of the databases available to the searcher. Possible improvements included increased stability (fewer interface glitches), less scrolling and a cleaner interface, and having access to reference management software to de-duplicate and collate results.</p>

          <p>Finally we asked people to rate their search experience a star rating, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent. The average rating was 3.7, with 34% rating 3 stars, 42% rating 4 stars and 21% rating 5 stars.</p>

          <p>Phase two of data collection is now well under way, and we are asking participants to fill out a similar survey for any searches they carry out on one specific day of their working week. We’ll be sharing the results from this phase over the next few months.</p>

          <p>In mid-September 2020, HEE began a pilot to understand how best to help LKS in England move from using HDAS to using provider interfaces (EBSCOhost, Proquest and Ovid)</p>

          <p>We’re now heading towards the end of the project and are currently analysing all of the data we’ve collected so we can pull together a report with recommendations for moving forward. Today we’re sharing some of the results from our training evaluation survey – the valuable feedback we’ve collected from pilot participants will shape the way training is rolled out to the rest of LKS in preparation for migration from HDAS to provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>Training was offered by all three interface providers (EBSCO, Proquest and Ovid). The team at University of Cambridge Medical Library also very kindly provided online training that was open to all pilot participants, regardless of geographical region. All of the training sessions were recorded and made available to those who couldn’t attend the live sessions. Of the 68 participants who completed the training evaluation survey, 93% had attended some training as part of the pilot.</p>

          <p>When asked if the training provided meant that participants felt ready to switch from using HDAS to provider interfaces for literature searching, the responses were split pretty much equally, with 51% answering yes and 49% answering no. We asked for further detail to help clarify the issues around preparedness, as this will be key to helping staff feel confident about moving from HDAS. Those who had answered ‘yes’ said that a) the training sessions were a good starting point, and that they were ready to dive in and start practicing (38%), or b) they already had some familiarity with provider interfaces and so the training acted as a refresher (34%). The responses for those who answered ‘no’ were more difficult to categorise. There was a feeling that the training on its own was not enough, that people needed time to consolidate their learning and practice. There were also comments about the need for follow up sessions so that there was an opportunity to ask questions and share experiences after the initial sessions.</p>

          <p>When asked what they would like to change about the training offered, 68% of participants said that the timing of sessions needed to be earlier. There were definitely slippages in the timing of the whole project, and we appreciate that the training schedule didn’t fit with the expectations of the pilot participants. We know from other comments that people needed time to process what they had learnt, to practice searching so they could increase their familiarity with interfaces and also to have a chance to come back to training if they need to. All of the sessions were demonstrations with time for questions, and 10% of participants would have liked hands on training, where there’s a chance to try a live search for yourself. However, there was a recognition that could be difficult in an online format.</p>

          <p>There was a marked difference in the feedback for the training delivered by provider representatives and the sessions held by the University of Cambridge Medical Library. Although satisfaction levels were not drastically different, participants commented positively on the content and structure of the Cambridge sessions. Their training focussed on taking a search from start to finish in an interface, whereas participants felt that the interface providers were demonstrating functionality and features that weren’t necessarily relevant to the search process.</p>

          <p>The next blog post for the pilot will be sharing some of the results from the data we’ve collected around ‘post-switch’ searches – those carried out in provider interfaces. Participants captured information about 296 searches, which is a fantastic resource for us to draw from.</p>

          <p>In mid-September 2020, HEE began a pilot to understand how best to help LKS in England move from using HDAS to using provider interfaces (EBSCOhost, Proquest and Ovid)</p>

          <p>We’re now heading towards the end of the project and are currently analysing all of the data we’ve collected so we can pull together a report with recommendations for moving forward. Today we’re sharing some of the results from our training evaluation survey – the valuable feedback we’ve collected from pilot participants will shape the way training is rolled out to the rest of LKS in preparation for migration from HDAS to provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>Training was offered by all three interface providers (EBSCO, Proquest and Ovid). The team at University of Cambridge Medical Library also very kindly provided online training that was open to all pilot participants, regardless of geographical region. All of the training sessions were recorded and made available to those who couldn’t attend the live sessions. Of the 68 participants who completed the training evaluation survey, 93% had attended some training as part of the pilot.</p>

          <p>When asked if the training provided meant that participants felt ready to switch from using HDAS to provider interfaces for literature searching, the responses were split pretty much equally, with 51% answering yes and 49% answering no. We asked for further detail to help clarify the issues around preparedness, as this will be key to helping staff feel confident about moving from HDAS. Those who had answered ‘yes’ said that a) the training sessions were a good starting point, and that they were ready to dive in and start practicing (38%), or b) they already had some familiarity with provider interfaces and so the training acted as a refresher (34%). The responses for those who answered ‘no’ were more difficult to categorise. There was a feeling that the training on its own was not enough, that people needed time to consolidate their learning and practice. There were also comments about the need for follow up sessions so that there was an opportunity to ask questions and share experiences after the initial sessions.</p>

          <p>When asked what they would like to change about the training offered, 68% of participants said that the timing of sessions needed to be earlier. There were definitely slippages in the timing of the whole project, and we appreciate that the training schedule didn’t fit with the expectations of the pilot participants. We know from other comments that people needed time to process what they had learnt, to practice searching so they could increase their familiarity with interfaces and also to have a chance to come back to training if they need to. All of the sessions were demonstrations with time for questions, and 10% of participants would have liked hands on training, where there’s a chance to try a live search for yourself. However, there was a recognition that could be difficult in an online format.</p>

          <p>There was a marked difference in the feedback for the training delivered by provider representatives and the sessions held by the University of Cambridge Medical Library. Although satisfaction levels were not drastically different, participants commented positively on the content and structure of the Cambridge sessions. Their training focussed on taking a search from start to finish in an interface, whereas participants felt that the interface providers were demonstrating functionality and features that weren’t necessarily relevant to the search process.</p>

          <p>The next blog post for the pilot will be sharing some of the results from the data we’ve collected around ‘post-switch’ searches – those carried out in provider interfaces. Participants captured information about 296 searches, which is a fantastic resource for us to draw from.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of single authentication</h2>

          <p>Having a single authentication system to allow our users to access all locally- and nationally-subscribed content is a real boon, but as many of you will be aware, there are some aspects of OpenAthens our users find troublesome:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>I can’t remember my password</li>
           <li>Why do I need yet another password? I already have too many</li>
           <li>I want to use the same password as I do for another system, but it won’t let me</li>
           <li>My account has expired and it won’t let me renew</li>

          <h2>Issues and their solutions</h2>

          <h3>Can’t remember my password</h3>

          <p>The password is now the same as their computer password; if they forget their password, they can reset it from their phones or phoning the IT helpdesk 24/7</p>

          <h3>Too many passwords</h3>

          <p>A separate password is no longer required</p>

          <h3>Want to use the same password</h3>

          <p>A separate password is no longer required, they use one they have already set up</p>

          <h3>My account has expired</h3>

          <p>Their accounts remain active for the entirety of the period they are employed by the trust</p>

          <h3>Setting up the account</h3>

          <p>They automatically have an account as soon as they get a computer login</p>

          <p>Hopefully you agree it’s a neat solution! It has taken six years and a lot of blood, sweat and tears to bring to fruition (it would have been five, but for the dreaded “C” word and lockdown) but we finally went live in April this year.

          <h2>Benefits of single authentication</h2>

          <p>Having a single authentication system to allow our users to access all locally- and nationally-subscribed content is a real boon, but as many of you will be aware, there are some aspects of OpenAthens our users find troublesome:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>I can’t remember my password</li>
           <li>Why do I need yet another password? I already have too many</li>
           <li>I want to use the same password as I do for another system, but it won’t let me</li>
           <li>My account has expired and it won’t let me renew</li>
           <li>I don’t have the time to sign up for yet another account</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When I joined the NHS in 2015 and started to hear this feedback, I started to investigate how we might ameliorate some of these issues for users in my trust.

          <p>Now that the report and recommendations following the <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/expert-searching-using-the-provider-interfaces--what-did-we-learn-from-the-early-adopter-pilot-and-what-happens-next" target="_blank">Expert Search Early Adopters Pilot Project</a> have been published, work is being undertaken to begin the process of supporting KLS staff to move away from using HDAS and towards provider interfaces (EBSCO, ProQuest and Ovid).</p>

          <p>The training program has now been finalised and sessions are available for any KLS staff to book on to. You can book on as many sessions as you like, and we encourage you to attend training early if possible.</p>

          <p>The Early Adopter pilot demonstrated that KLS staff need time to become confident in using the provider interfaces. By providing training well in advance we hope you’ll have the opportunity to consolidate new skills and information and then attend training again closer to March 2022 if you feel the need to.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We’ve tried to ensure there are training opportunities for everyone, regardless of their role or how frequently they use databases. There are two different sets of sessions available – <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#provider_training_dates" target="_blank">Provider Training</a> at Basic and Advanced levels, and <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#expert_search_dates" target="_blank">Expert Search Training</a> delivered by a team of KLS professionals.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#provider_training_dates" target="_blank">Provider Training</a> sessions are an hour long and are delivered by trainers from EBSCO, Ovid and ProQuest. They will be delivered regularly from now until March 2022, and dates for July and August are now available <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#provider_training_dates" target="_blank">here.</a> New dates will be added regularly every month, so if you don’t manage to book on to a session straight away then check back again for more dates.</p>

          <p>Basic sessions are suitable for staff who use databases occasionally. Participants are shown how to:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>access databases</li>
           <li>carry out a simple search</li>
           <li>find out if they have full text access to an article</li>
           <li>email a set of results.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Advanced sessions are suitable for staff who use databases regularly to carry out evidence searches.</p>

          <p>Participants are shown how to:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>carry out an advanced search</li>
           <li>use thesaurus terms</li>
           <li>combine searches</li>
           <li>apply limits</li>
           <li>save searches</li>
           <li>save results in a variety of different formats</li>
           <li>export results to reference management software</li>
          </ul>

          <p><a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#expert_search_dates" target="_blank">Expert Search Training</a> sessions are 90 minutes long and are delivered by trainers who regularly use provider interfaces to carry out evidence searches, led by the Cambridge University Medical Library. They will use real-life complex search examples, follow a search process from start to finish, provide examples of best practice as well as hints, tips and shortcuts.</p>

          <p>These sessions are aimed at KLS staff who regularly carry out literature searches. They were trialled during the early adopter pilot and were very well received by participants. They will be delivered in two phases – August and September, and then again in January and February.</p>

          <p>Sessions are available on all three interfaces, and dates for August and September are available <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#expert_search_dates" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

          <p>We recommend you work with your colleagues to map out a plan as to how you’ll begin to move away from HDAS and start using the provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>Now that the report and recommendations following the <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/expert-searching-using-the-provider-interfaces--what-did-we-learn-from-the-early-adopter-pilot-and-what-happens-next" target="_blank">Expert Search Early Adopters Pilot Project</a> have been published, work is being undertaken to begin the process of supporting KLS staff to move away from using HDAS and towards provider interfaces (EBSCO, ProQuest and Ovid).</p>

          <p>The training program has now been finalised and sessions are available for any KLS staff to book on to. You can book on as many sessions as you like, and we encourage you to attend training early if possible.</p>

          <p>The Early Adopter pilot demonstrated that KLS staff need time to become confident in using the provider interfaces. By providing training well in advance we hope you’ll have the opportunity to consolidate new skills and information and then attend training again closer to March 2022 if you feel the need to.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We’ve tried to ensure there are training opportunities for everyone, regardless of their role or how frequently they use databases. There are two different sets of sessions available – <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#provider_training_dates" target="_blank">Provider Training</a> at Basic and Advanced levels, and <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#expert_search_dates" target="_blank">Expert Search Training</a> delivered by a team of KLS professionals.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#provider_training_dates" target="_blank">Provider Training</a> sessions are an hour long and are delivered by trainers from EBSCO, Ovid and ProQuest. They will be delivered regularly from now until March 2022, and dates for July and August are now available <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#provider_training_dates" target="_blank">here.</a> New dates will be added regularly every month, so if you don’t manage to book on to a session straight away then check back again for more dates.</p>

          <p>Basic sessions are suitable for staff who use databases occasionally. Participants are shown how to:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>access databases</li>
           <li>carry out a simple search</li>
           <li>find out if they have full text access to an article</li>
           <li>email a set of results.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Advanced sessions are suitable for staff who use databases regularly to carry out evidence searches.</p>

          <p>Participants are shown how to:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>carry out an advanced search</li>
           <li>use thesaurus terms</li>
           <li>combine searches</li>
           <li>apply limits</li>
           <li>save searches</li>
           <li>save results in a variety of different formats</li>
           <li>export results to reference management software</li>
          </ul>

          <p><a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#expert_search_dates" target="_blank">Expert Search Training</a> sessions are 90 minutes long and are delivered by trainers who regularly use provider interfaces to carry out evidence searches, led by the Cambridge University Medical Library. They will use real-life complex search examples, follow a search process from start to finish, provide examples of best practice as well as hints, tips and shortcuts.</p>

          <p>These sessions are aimed at KLS staff who regularly carry out literature searches. They were trialled during the early adopter pilot and were very well received by participants. They will be delivered in two phases – August and September, and then again in January and February.</p>

          <p>Sessions are available on all three interfaces, and dates for August and September are available <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/national-systems/expert-searching#expert_search_dates" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

          <p>We recommend you work with your colleagues to map out a plan as to how you’ll begin to move away from HDAS and start using the provider interfaces.</p>

          <p>As knowledge and library specialists, we hardly need convincing of the value of professional networking and specialist skills development, and our&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;informatics colleagues see the same benefits in&nbsp;working collaboratively to develop their skills&nbsp;and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>From data analysts to IT trainers to web developers and clinical informaticians,&nbsp;digital specialists provide the infrastructure around the daily work of the NHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many knowledge and library specialists work closely with&nbsp;other&nbsp;informatics&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;day to day.&nbsp; Did you know that informaticians&nbsp;are building&nbsp;local professional networks – Informatics Skills Development Networks?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The first Informatics Skills Development Network (ISDN) was established&nbsp;almost 20&nbsp;years ago in the&nbsp;North West&nbsp;followed by Yorkshire and the Humber and London.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are part of&nbsp;the wider Skills Development Networks which include&nbsp;Finance and Procurement specialists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Education England is now supporting the development of new ISDNs in other regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;In true KM fashion, the new Networks&nbsp;are benefiting from the lessons learned&nbsp;in setting up the&nbsp;North West&nbsp;Network which have been shared in the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/isdn-toolkit/" target="_blank">ISDN in a Box Toolkit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In the&nbsp;North West, membership of the&nbsp;ISD&nbsp;Network provides&nbsp;focused&nbsp;learning and development opportunities&nbsp;from apprenticeship through to director level.&nbsp; It&nbsp;encourages collaborative working,&nbsp;sharing of good practice&nbsp;including data sharing across organisations.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Excellence in Informatics Accreditation&nbsp;Scheme&nbsp;recognises good practice in organisational workforce development.&nbsp;The Network also facilitates Special Interest Groups for sub-specialties including analytical data science,&nbsp;project management and IT training.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Christine Banks, the&nbsp;North&nbsp;West&nbsp;ISD Manager,&nbsp;is very clear&nbsp;that&nbsp;“Library&nbsp;and Knowledge Management teams are regarded as part of the wider Informatics workforce and could benefit from linking in with their regional ISD networks as well as&nbsp;their&nbsp;local Informatics teams.”&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Following on from the publication of the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Topol Review</a>&nbsp;two years ago,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/page/researchreport" target="_blank">CILIP’s&nbsp;Report on the&nbsp;impact of new&nbsp;technologies</a>&nbsp;and the refresh of the&nbsp;CILIP Professionals Knowledge and Skills Base (PKSB)&nbsp;this year, there is a&nbsp;strong&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the&nbsp;development of digital, data and software skills for&nbsp;<a href="two-years-on-from-topol-preparing-ourselves-for-the-digital-future">NHS&nbsp;knowledge and library specialists</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we build our skills for the future, we can also build on existing partnerships and look for opportunities to collaborate&nbsp;in the best interests of patients&nbsp;as well as to&nbsp;learn with our NHS colleagues in the informatics field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>ISDNs provide us&nbsp;with a&nbsp;timely&nbsp;opportunity to:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Get involved with our regional networks; develop our skills and connections.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>

          <p>As knowledge and library specialists, we hardly need convincing of the value of professional networking and specialist skills development, and our&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;informatics colleagues see the same benefits in&nbsp;working collaboratively to develop their skills&nbsp;and knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>From data analysts to IT trainers to web developers and clinical informaticians,&nbsp;digital specialists provide the infrastructure around the daily work of the NHS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many knowledge and library specialists work closely with&nbsp;other&nbsp;informatics&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;day to day.&nbsp; Did you know that informaticians&nbsp;are building&nbsp;local professional networks – Informatics Skills Development Networks?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Do you want to know about sustainability? Do you want to make your service, and help your Trust become more sustainable?</p>

          <p>You’ll have heard about environmental sustainability. &nbsp;Health and care is responsible for about 4-5% of the nation’s carbon footprint. The NHS has committed to delivering net zero emissions as part of its Greener NHS strategy.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>For emissions the NHS can control, the aim is to get to net zero by 2040.&nbsp; For those emissions it can influence, it’s 2045.</p>

          <p>Much of this will be achieved through energy efficiency, by reducing travel, decarbonising the supply chain and removing waste, for example by reducing single-use plastics.</p>

          <p>At FutureLearn, ‘the term sustainability is broadly used to indicate programs, initiatives and actions aimed at the preservation of a particular resource. However, it actually refers to four distinct areas’ <sup>2</sup>:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Human</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">This is about maintaining human capital in society.&nbsp; It’s about health and education, ensuring people have the right knowledge and skills to maintain health and economic wellbeing for all.&nbsp; This could include our work with the literacies: health literacy; digital; information</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Social</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">This focuses on improving social equality.&nbsp; It includes ‘concepts such as cohesion, reciprocity, honesty and relationships amongst people’ <sup>2&nbsp; </sup></p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Economic</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">This is about improving the standard of living. In the context of business, it refers to the efficient use of assets to maintain company profitability over time.&nbsp; In the NHS context this refers to maintaining financial stability.</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Environmental</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">About improving our impact on the environment.</p>

          <p>To this I’d add two further types: digital sustainability&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> and the sustainability of spread and adoption <sup>4</sup>.&nbsp; NHS Digital defines digital collaboration as the greater use of online services, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.</p>

          <p>Sustaining spread and adoption is about making sure innovations and changes stick in an organisation and are adopted by others.&nbsp; It’s about ‘holding the gains’ and ‘evolving as required.’</p>

          <p>Improving working practices to contribute to a low-carbon society has been added to the Knowledge for Healthcare strategy as a guiding principle.</p>

          <p>Do you want to know about sustainability? Do you want to make your service, and help your Trust become more sustainable?</p>

          <p>You’ll have heard about environmental sustainability. &nbsp;Health and care is responsible for about 4-5% of the nation’s carbon footprint. The NHS has committed to delivering net zero emissions as part of its Greener NHS strategy.<sup>1</sup></p>

          <p>For emissions the NHS can control, the aim is to get to net zero by 2040.&nbsp; For those emissions it can influence, it’s 2045.</p>

          <p>Much of this will be achieved through energy efficiency, by reducing travel, decarbonising the supply chain and removing waste, for example by reducing single-use plastics.</p>

          <p>At FutureLearn, ‘the term sustainability is broadly used to indicate programs, initiatives and actions aimed at the preservation of a particular resource. However, it actually refers to four distinct areas’ <sup>2</sup>:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Human</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">This is about maintaining human capital in society.&nbsp; It’s about health and education, ensuring people have the right knowledge and skills to maintain health and economic wellbeing for all.&nbsp; This could include our work with the literacies: health literacy; digital; information</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Social</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">This focuses on improving social equality.&nbsp; It includes ‘concepts such as cohesion, reciprocity, honesty and relationships amongst people’ <sup>2&nbsp; </sup></p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Economic</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">This is about improving the standard of living. In the context of business, it refers to the efficient use of assets to maintain company profitability over time.&nbsp; In the NHS context this refers to maintaining financial stability.</p>

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Environmental</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:38px">About improving our impact on the environment.</p>

          <p>To this I’d add two further types: digital sustainability&nbsp;<sup>3</sup> and the sustainability of spread and adoption <sup>4</sup>.&nbsp; NHS Digital defines digital collaboration as the greater use of online services, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.</p>

          <p>Sustaining spread and adoption is about making sure innovations and changes stick in an organisation and are adopted by others.&nbsp; It’s about ‘holding the gains’ and ‘evolving as required.’</p>

          <p>Improving working practices to contribute to a low-carbon society has been added to the Knowledge for Healthcare strategy as a guiding principle.</p>

          <p>‘Knowledge specialists have a dual role in contributing to the sustainability agenda, within the knowledge service itself and by providing the evidence to underpin policy, commissioning, operational practice and training.’</p>

          <p>Some examples from KLS include, buying eco-friendly materials, developing services which are digital b default, working in partnership to reduce duplication and building sustainability into strategies and policy.</p>

          <p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been contributing to the NHS net zero goals by working from home, reducing travel to and from work, and by holding meetings virtually.&nbsp; We have seen an increasing emphasis on digital resources and improving the knowledge and skills of the workforce.</p>

          <p>Thinking about the different types of sustainability, what are you doing about sustainability locally?&nbsp; We’d love to hear about how you’re contributing or any ideas you may have to make KLS even more sustainable.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If you’re involved and interested in sustainability, we’d like to form a community of practice to share ideas and inspire change.</p>

          <p>In the early part of this year I had the privilege of supporting the delivery of a Health Librarianship module to Library and Information Studies students at University College London (UCL).</p>

          <p>Over ten weeks we delivered a weekly session on a variety of topics integral to the work we do as health librarians and to give the students a broad look at the structure of NHS Knowledge and Library Services.</p>

          <p>Many people took the time to support the delivery of the sessions or mentor the students, so a big thank you to everyone who contributed. We had five students who took the module, and two who were being marked for the course.</p>

          <p>As part of their assignments we asked the students to write two reflective pieces looking at a topic they had enjoyed from the course. Here we have the first two pieces for you to read.</p>

          <p>I hope you enjoy their reflections as much as I did.</p>

          <h2><strong>Marshalling Evidence Through Advocacy</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Andrew Lacey</strong></h3>

          <p>The first weeks of the Health Librarianship module have been enlightening. It has been interesting to learn where the long-term plans of the NHS and Library and Knowledge Services (LKS) intersect.</p>

          <p>What struck me was the push within Health Education England (HEE) policies (Reid and Mitchell, 2019) to directly input into patient care by focusing on the roles of embedded librarianship.</p>

          <p>Embedded LKS roles require taking greater responsibility for delivering evidence into patient care and trust services. This is pivotal to HEEs drive for NHS LKS to be regarded as business critical.</p>

          <p>Many libraries only reach a fraction of their potential user group, and health libraries are no different. In fact, this is more pronounced due to the extreme time constraints placed on medical staff. Additionally, the ability to reach all users within the Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) model is challenging.</p>

          <p>A study of nursing staff’s involvement with Clinical Librarians (McTavish, 2017), demonstrated time pressures as being the main barrier to engagement with Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).</p>

          <p>By utilising Clinical Librarians as a tool of instructional outreach and advocacy, the nurse’s application of EBM became simpler and less time constrained. This reinforces HEEs value proposition: the ‘gift of time’ (Health Education England, 2020).</p>

          <p>Central to this temporal gift is Clinical Librarians’ ability to find the best evidence; and fostering a clinical environment that encourages the asking of questions and thus the evolution of clinical practice.</p>

          <p>Embedded librarians become a tool of advocacy by demonstrating the tangible role that LKS can play in improved patient outcomes and cost saving possibilities. What remains challenging is how to effectively demonstrate value to individual trusts?</p>

          <p>These roles mean engaging at all levels in multifaceted ways. From working with clinicians; to imputing into research, clinical governance, and service improvement. Take-up of embedded librarianship across different trusts has been stymied by an ongoing challenge of communicating value to the right people, to secure funding.</p>

          <p>The application of which felt frustratingly inconsistent, especially when coupled with the statutory requirement of the NHS to use evidence to inform practice. However, case study promotional material was effective, and work was ongoing to develop LKS professionals with the soft skills to influence at a higher organisational level.</p>

          <p>A recent study articulated the value of embedded librarians, not only to qualified medical staff, but also medical students (Gibbons and Werner, 2019). Students experience a culture shock when transitioning from academic learning to practice, and the skills of embedded librarians are currently an underutilised area of learning support.</p>

          <p>A way of communicating value to trusts could be a greater alignment with medical students on placement; a user group who potentially engage more with EBM compared to qualified clinicians.</p>

          <p>Ensuring EBM is structurally incorporated and that practitioners possess the skills to facilitate it consistently, emerged as the two main barriers to evidence mobilisation. Yet, embedded librarianship can inject energy into EBM application, by articulating the increased need in the cross disciplinary working involved in Integrated Care Systems (ICSs).</p>

          <p>With the expected release of a Governmental white paper setting out overhauls to the NHS England model, demonstrating service value will remain challenging. However, a proposed greater emphasis on service integration could benefit LKS going forward (Blackall, 2021).</p>

          <p>It has been brilliant to discover the tangible differences that LKS make to service improvement and patient outcomes, and the rigor with which HEE are amplifying the work of LKS staff. Demonstrating their important value to UK health services.</p>

          <h2><strong>School libraries could learn a lesson or two from health library advocacy strategies</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Penny Williams</strong></h3>

          <p>When a new Health Librarianship module with Health Education England was offered to students on the Library and Information Studies course at UCL this year, I was instantly intrigued.</p>

          <p>I had heard within the library community that health librarianship is a growing field, at a time when so many other library sectors are facing threats. The truth was though, I only knew a snapshot of what health librarians do, and it turned out I was not alone.</p>

          <p>As I learnt more about the integral role health librarians play within the health services, I was seriously impressed and found myself waxing lyrical to curious colleagues. It became clear why advocacy is so essential.</p>

          <p>The lack of awareness <em>within</em> the field came as more of a surprise. I was reminded of similar issues in my school library role and saw areas where schools could model health advocacy strategies.</p>

          <p>Advocacy has been described as vital for health librarians in their daily interactions with colleagues in all sectors of the NHS. Librarians are walking adverts for all that the service has to offer. Be visible, be approachable, do an excellent job, prove your value.</p>

          <p>As a school librarian, such approaches have become all-too familiar. Funding cuts and library closures have necessitated the #GreatSchoolLibraries campaign, launched in 2018, which could well have been inspired by #AMillionDecisions with its evidence-based approach and use of case studies.</p>

          <p>It sought to ‘encourage Ofsted to recognise libraries and librarians in their school inspection framework’ (Great School Libraries, n.d.). This perception of the library as ‘other’ and being treated differently to teaching departments has been echoed to some extent by health librarians in their experiences with clinical departments.</p>

          <p>However, greater strides seem to have been made by #AMillionDecisions in raising the profile of the service within the NHS<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>, and schools could benefit from considering why this might be.</p>

          <p>Whilst the value of NHS Library and Knowledge services are calculated in economic terms, and the potential net economic benefit believed to be £77m per annum, ‘further high-quality NHS based research will help to quantify the ‘gift of time’ for healthcare professionals and the associated quality improvement benefits for patients.’<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> In school terms, the practise of ‘Save the time of the user’<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> could also be better applied and efforts made to quantify the value-added school experience offered to students.</p>

          <p>As part of #GreatSchoolLibraries, a CILIP Briefing Note was written for librarians to present to school leadership, explicitly outlining the value of investing in school libraries and professional library staff (n.d.). This letter demonstrated that there was no longer an inherent understanding of the role of the school librarian, forever altered with the arrival of the digital age and new ways of accessing information.</p>

          <p>It seems, health librarians too have faced this need to reappraise others about their role and to demonstrate that their skills and working practices have moved apace with digital developments, ensuring they are a huge asset in today’s healthcare organisations.</p>

          <p>Developing and showcasing these skills is fundamental to advocacy but, sadly, school librarians are not offered the same opportunities for CPD as their health counterparts. In 2019 only 44% of school librarians completing a national survey had experienced some form of CPD during the previous year.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p>

          <p>In comparison, ‘over 1,600 LKS staff attended over 90 different events in 2019-20.’<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> It has been refreshing to encounter an unwavering belief from health librarians in the ‘gift of time’ service they are offering, backed by training and support<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>.</p>

          <p>With minimal CPD for school library staff, many lack the confidence to effectively advocate for themselves, preventing future CPD funding and exacerbating the problem. The generous training offering from the NHS is testament to the future of the service and schools could look at the possible impact of a similar approach on the value-added student experience school leadership teams are seeking.</p>

          <p>In the early part of this year I had the privilege of supporting the delivery of a Health Librarianship module to Library and Information Studies students at University College London (UCL).</p>

          <p>Over ten weeks we delivered a weekly session on a variety of topics integral to the work we do as health librarians and to give the students a broad look at the structure of NHS Knowledge and Library Services.</p>

          <p>Many people took the time to support the delivery of the sessions or mentor the students, so a big thank you to everyone who contributed. We had five students who took the module, and two who were being marked for the course.</p>

          <p>As part of their assignments we asked the students to write two reflective pieces looking at a topic they had enjoyed from the course. Here we have the first two pieces for you to read.</p>

          <p>I hope you enjoy their reflections as much as I did.</p>

          <h2><strong>Marshalling Evidence Through Advocacy</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Andrew Lacey</strong></h3>

          <p>The first weeks of the Health Librarianship module have been enlightening. It has been interesting to learn where the long-term plans of the NHS and Library and Knowledge Services (LKS) intersect.</p>

          <p>What struck me was the push within Health Education England (HEE) policies (Reid and Mitchell, 2019) to directly input into patient care by focusing on the roles of embedded librarianship.</p>

          <p>Embedded LKS roles require taking greater responsibility for delivering evidence into patient care and trust services. This is pivotal to HEEs drive for NHS LKS to be regarded as business critical.</p>

          <p>Many libraries only reach a fraction of their potential user group, and health libraries are no different. In fact, this is more pronounced due to the extreme time constraints placed on medical staff. Additionally, the ability to reach all users within the Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) model is challenging.</p>

          <p>A study of nursing staff’s involvement with Clinical Librarians (McTavish, 2017), demonstrated time pressures as being the main barrier to engagement with Evidence Based Medicine (EBM).</p>

          <p>By utilising Clinical Librarians as a tool of instructional outreach and advocacy, the nurse’s application of EBM became simpler and less time constrained. This reinforces HEEs value proposition: the ‘gift of time’ (Health Education England, 2020).</p>

          <p>Central to this temporal gift is Clinical Librarians’ ability to find the best evidence; and fostering a clinical environment that encourages the asking of questions and thus the evolution of clinical practice.</p>

          <p>Embedded librarians become a tool of advocacy by demonstrating the tangible role that LKS can play in improved patient outcomes and cost saving possibilities. What remains challenging is how to effectively demonstrate value to individual trusts?</p>

          <p>These roles mean engaging at all levels in multifaceted ways. From working with clinicians; to imputing into research, clinical governance, and service improvement. Take-up of embedded librarianship across different trusts has been stymied by an ongoing challenge of communicating value to the right people, to secure funding.</p>

          <p>The application of which felt frustratingly inconsistent, especially when coupled with the statutory requirement of the NHS to use evidence to inform practice. However, case study promotional material was effective, and work was ongoing to develop LKS professionals with the soft skills to influence at a higher organisational level.</p>

          <p>A recent study articulated the value of embedded librarians, not only to qualified medical staff, but also medical students (Gibbons and Werner, 2019). Students experience a culture shock when transitioning from academic learning to practice, and the skills of embedded librarians are currently an underutilised area of learning support.</p>

          <p>A way of communicating value to trusts could be a greater alignment with medical students on placement; a user group who potentially engage more with EBM compared to qualified clinicians.</p>

          <p>Ensuring EBM is structurally incorporated and that practitioners possess the skills to facilitate it consistently, emerged as the two main barriers to evidence mobilisation. Yet, embedded librarianship can inject energy into EBM application, by articulating the increased need in the cross disciplinary working involved in Integrated Care Systems (ICSs).</p>

          <p>With the expected release of a Governmental white paper setting out overhauls to the NHS England model, demonstrating service value will remain challenging. However, a proposed greater emphasis on service integration could benefit LKS going forward (Blackall, 2021).</p>

          <p>It has been brilliant to discover the tangible differences that LKS make to service improvement and patient outcomes, and the rigor with which HEE are amplifying the work of LKS staff. Demonstrating their important value to UK health services.</p>

          <h2><strong>School libraries could learn a lesson or two from health library advocacy strategies</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Penny Williams</strong></h3>

          <p>When a new Health Librarianship module with Health Education England was offered to students on the Library and Information Studies course at UCL this year, I was instantly intrigued.</p>

          <p>I had heard within the library community that health librarianship is a growing field, at a time when so many other library sectors are facing threats. The truth was though, I only knew a snapshot of what health librarians do, and it turned out I was not alone.</p>

          <p>As I learnt more about the integral role health librarians play within the health services, I was seriously impressed and found myself waxing lyrical to curious colleagues. It became clear why advocacy is so essential.</p>

          <p>The lack of awareness <em>within</em> the field came as more of a surprise. I was reminded of similar issues in my school library role and saw areas where schools could model health advocacy strategies.</p>

          <p>Advocacy has been described as vital for health librarians in their daily interactions with colleagues in all sectors of the NHS. Librarians are walking adverts for all that the service has to offer. Be visible, be approachable, do an excellent job, prove your value.</p>

          <p>As a school librarian, such approaches have become all-too familiar. Funding cuts and library closures have necessitated the #GreatSchoolLibraries campaign, launched in 2018, which could well have been inspired by #AMillionDecisions with its evidence-based approach and use of case studies.</p>

          <p>It sought to ‘encourage Ofsted to recognise libraries and librarians in their school inspection framework’ (Great School Libraries, n.d.). This perception of the library as ‘other’ and being treated differently to teaching departments has been echoed to some extent by health librarians in their experiences with clinical departments.</p>

          <p>However, greater strides seem to have been made by #AMillionDecisions in raising the profile of the service within the NHS<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>, and schools could benefit from considering why this might be.</p>

          <p>Whilst the value of NHS Library and Knowledge services are calculated in economic terms, and the potential net economic benefit believed to be £77m per annum, ‘further high-quality NHS based research will help to quantify the ‘gift of time’ for healthcare professionals and the associated quality improvement benefits for patients.’<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> In school terms, the practise of ‘Save the time of the user’<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> could also be better applied and efforts made to quantify the value-added school experience offered to students.</p>

          <p>As part of #GreatSchoolLibraries, a CILIP Briefing Note was written for librarians to present to school leadership, explicitly outlining the value of investing in school libraries and professional library staff (n.d.). This letter demonstrated that there was no longer an inherent understanding of the role of the school librarian, forever altered with the arrival of the digital age and new ways of accessing information.</p>

          <p>It seems, health librarians too have faced this need to reappraise others about their role and to demonstrate that their skills and working practices have moved apace with digital developments, ensuring they are a huge asset in today’s healthcare organisations.</p>

          <p>Developing and showcasing these skills is fundamental to advocacy but, sadly, school librarians are not offered the same opportunities for CPD as their health counterparts. In 2019 only 44% of school librarians completing a national survey had experienced some form of CPD during the previous year.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p>

          <p>In comparison, ‘over 1,600 LKS staff attended over 90 different events in 2019-20.’<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> It has been refreshing to encounter an unwavering belief from health librarians in the ‘gift of time’ service they are offering, backed by training and support<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>.</p>

          <p>With minimal CPD for school library staff, many lack the confidence to effectively advocate for themselves, preventing future CPD funding and exacerbating the problem. The generous training offering from the NHS is testament to the future of the service and schools could look at the possible impact of a similar approach on the value-added student experience school leadership teams are seeking.</p>

          <p>As a school librarian, such approaches have become all-too familiar. Funding cuts and library closures have necessitated the #GreatSchoolLibraries campaign, launched in 2018, which could well have been inspired by #AMillionDecisions with its evidence-based approach and use of case studies.</p>

          <p>It sought to ‘encourage Ofsted to recognise libraries and librarians in their school inspection framework’ (Great School Libraries, n.d.). This perception of the library as ‘other’ and being treated differently to teaching departments has been echoed to some extent by health librarians in their experiences with clinical departments.</p>

          <p>However, greater strides seem to have been made by #AMillionDecisions in raising the profile of the service within the NHS<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>, and schools could benefit from considering why this might be.</p>

          <p>Whilst the value of NHS Library and Knowledge services are calculated in economic terms, and the potential net economic benefit believed to be £77m per annum, ‘further high-quality NHS based research will help to quantify the ‘gift of time’ for healthcare professionals and the associated quality improvement benefits for patients.’<a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a> In school terms, the practise of ‘Save the time of the user’<a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a> could also be better applied and efforts made to quantify the value-added school experience offered to students.</p>

          <p>As part of #GreatSchoolLibraries, a CILIP Briefing Note was written for librarians to present to school leadership, explicitly outlining the value of investing in school libraries and professional library staff (n.d.). This letter demonstrated that there was no longer an inherent understanding of the role of the school librarian, forever altered with the arrival of the digital age and new ways of accessing information.</p>

          <p>It seems, health librarians too have faced this need to reappraise others about their role and to demonstrate that their skills and working practices have moved apace with digital developments, ensuring they are a huge asset in today’s healthcare organisations.</p>

          <p>Developing and showcasing these skills is fundamental to advocacy but, sadly, school librarians are not offered the same opportunities for CPD as their health counterparts. In 2019 only 44% of school librarians completing a national survey had experienced some form of CPD during the previous year.<a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a></p>

          <p>In comparison, ‘over 1,600 LKS staff attended over 90 different events in 2019-20.’<a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a> It has been refreshing to encounter an unwavering belief from health librarians in the ‘gift of time’ service they are offering, backed by training and support<a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>.</p>

          <p>With minimal CPD for school library staff, many lack the confidence to effectively advocate for themselves, preventing future CPD funding and exacerbating the problem. The generous training offering from the NHS is testament to the future of the service and schools could look at the possible impact of a similar approach on the value-added student experience school leadership teams are seeking.</p>

          <p>Following on from my previous blog post, this is part two of sharing the reflections of the learning of the students who completed the UCL Health Module earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Both Penny and Andy chose to write about health literacy. Penny explores how school librarians can support the growth of health literate children, which is timely considering the publishing of our Health Literacy Schools Toolkit developed for 16+ year olds <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/HLschools/home">https://southlks.libguides.com/HLschools/home</a> .</p>

          <p>Andy looks at the barriers that having poor mental health can have on accessing health information, something that many of us will be acutely aware of. Both students’ reflections show how important health literacy skills and having high-quality health information is for our communities.</p>

          <h2><strong>Empowering health literate children: a school librarian’s perspective </strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Penny Williams</strong></h3>

          <p>In the 2021 Knowledge for Healthcare strategy, ‘empowering health literate citizens’ is a focus of activity to ensure that ‘patients, carers and members of the public who access, understand, appraise and use health information have better health-related outcomes’<a name="_ftnref1" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>

          <p>Many of the factors which underpin health literacy issues in those aged 16-65, such as information and digital literacy, also impact secondary school children, combined with additional difficulties in training school staff, lack of time in the curriculum and poor engagement.</p>

          <p>I will explore these factors from my perspective as a school librarian of an inner-city school along with feedback from the Head of PSHE and the school nurse.</p>

          <p>It has been encouraging to see the Department for Education (DfE) focusing on health education by making PSHE and RSE programmes statutory in UK schools from September 2020<a name="_ftnref2" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>, albeit with a delayed implementation as a result of COVID-19<a name="_ftnref3" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>.</p>

          <p>In many schools, such as mine, the PSHE programme has continued regardless but with no change seen in the content or delivery. School librarians are given a backseat in delivering health education, with their involvement confined to providing resources to support students who wish to actively seek out this information.</p>

          <p>Time constraints mean PSHE is often shoe-horned into form time, where it is allocated between 20 minutes to one hour per week. These sessions are delivered by form tutors who mostly have no health background and little time or funding for training. With health information delivered in this way, teachers have observed that students attach less value to the content<a name="_ftnref4" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>.</p>

          <p>Whilst some teenagers are engaging more with exercise and healthy eating, physical health in a more medical sense is not a hot topic. Invincibility theory in teenagers plays out with many showing little engagement. When it comes to mental health, however, students display a much keener interest.</p>

          <p>In 2018, students at my school completed a voice exercise about information they wanted to cover in PSHE lessons and the overwhelming response was ‘mental health’. However, teachers found that the term ‘mental health’ itself could be reactive and that ‘delivering content through lesson components such as ‘wellbeing’ and ‘confidence’ were more effective ways of promoting engagement’<a name="_ftnref5" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>.</p>

          <p>Counteracting the barrage of Fake Health News young people are facing as well as poor health behaviours experienced in the family home is problematic. This has been compounded during the past year with school closures.</p>

          <p>My school has focused on running sessions to educate parents such as ‘The Teenage Brain’ but uptake is patchy and often the families who these sessions target are less likely to attend.</p>

          <p>For students with English as an Additional Language (EAL) the barriers to health literacy can be more pronounced. Students new to the UK face huge upheaval but lack the emotional vocabulary to describe mental health issues, which can mean they are less able to access health services. EAL students are also twice as likely to be Young Carers<a name="_ftnref6" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>but school staff are often not immediately able to communicate their needs to school staff.</p>

          <p>It is promising to learn about the pilot Health Literacy project in Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust in collaboration with the School Library Association and I look forward to hearing their findings.</p>

          <p>Perhaps with a more developed and persistent approach to teaching health in an engaging and accessible way whether that be in the classroom or with more involvement from school librarians, we could see a marked improvement in health literacy in young people that would continue into their adult years. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Barriers to Health Literacy</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Andy Lacey</strong></h3>

          <p>Health literacy describes an individual’s ability to comprehend and act upon health information, covering a large set of overlapping difficulties. These include literacy, numeracy, and socioeconomic realities.</p>

          <p>To address skills barriers, the use of e-learning resources provides clinicians and organisations with the tools to present health information in accessible ways <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">https://www.e</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">lfh.org.uk/</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">)</a>.</p>

          <p>Strategies include the ‘teach back’ and ‘chunk and check’ methods, which have become important tool’s for imparting health information. Library and Knowledge Services (LKS) have been vital at imputing evidence into patient information, with some trusts employing Patient Librarians to assist in decoding health information.</p>

          <p>South West , Thames Valley, and Wessex LKS have been especially adept at providing health literacy awareness training for trust staff, building collaborative organisational links; helping to embed health literacy within their respective trusts <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">)</a>.</p>

          <p>In tackling physical access barriers, Health Librarians partnerships with Prison Librarians, was timely. As prisoners often suffer from the cumulative effects of social disadvantage, poor literacy/numeracy skills, and limited access.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The Terrence Higgins Trust has&nbsp;undertaken research to understand how different demographics access health information (Terrence Higgins Trust, 2020) and how they can adjust the delivery of their health information provision to meet different information seeking behaviours.</p>

          <p>Beyond skills and access barriers, there are those caused by stigma. Stigmatisation due to health conditions is a barrier to help seeking behaviour. As Jorm (2012) highlights, due to successful public health campaigns, many people are aware of common signs of serious physical conditions e.g. heart attack or stroke. What is less known is how to identify and tackle mental health conditions.</p>

          <p>People are unprepared to address the signs of mental health conditions, such as depression or schizophrenia; with some stating that sufferers “should spend time in the sun” or “just get on with it” (Jorm, 2012). This demonstrates a reluctance to seek professional help, or knowledge about available support services. The creation of more widespread mental health literacy would help suffers and their families, identify a mental health crisis and seek help.</p>

          <p>Having grown up with a family member who suffers from schizophrenia, useful literacy interventions would have been invaluable. These include, self-help strategies, mental health first aid skills, support for carers, and prevention strategies; through a combination of education, web, and community-based interventions (Jorm, 2012).</p>

          <p>Subsequently, NHS England and Health Education England, launched MindEd e-learning program; which helps people identify, understand and support those with mental health conditions <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">https://www.minded.org.uk/</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">)</a>. This presents a welcome tool for demystifying mental illness for sufferers and their families/carers.</p>

          <p>Mental health services have been subjected to low funding because they do not enjoy the same level of public understanding as other conditions. The COVID pandemic has shone a light on mental health and increased awareness. As a result, spending on mental health services has increased during the pandemic (albeit after years of decline).</p>

          <p>A mental health focus is pertinent to the NHS workforce. After the pandemic subsides, there will be members of staff who need mental health support. So too will increasing members of the public. LKS will be well placed to act as information hubs for the promotion of mental health literacy within their respective trusts and will be invaluable at inputting evidence.</p>

          <p>Signalling their support for colleagues at this critical time also represents cost avoidance for trusts and may help with staff retention post pandemic.</p>

          <p>Following on from my previous blog post, this is part two of sharing the reflections of the learning of the students who completed the UCL Health Module earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Both Penny and Andy chose to write about health literacy. Penny explores how school librarians can support the growth of health literate children, which is timely considering the publishing of our Health Literacy Schools Toolkit developed for 16+ year olds <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/HLschools/home">https://southlks.libguides.com/HLschools/home</a> .</p>

          <p>Andy looks at the barriers that having poor mental health can have on accessing health information, something that many of us will be acutely aware of. Both students’ reflections show how important health literacy skills and having high-quality health information is for our communities.</p>

          <h2><strong>Empowering health literate children: a school librarian’s perspective </strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Penny Williams</strong></h3>

          <p>In the 2021 Knowledge for Healthcare strategy, ‘empowering health literate citizens’ is a focus of activity to ensure that ‘patients, carers and members of the public who access, understand, appraise and use health information have better health-related outcomes’<a name="_ftnref1" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn1" title="">[1]</a>.</p>

          <p>Many of the factors which underpin health literacy issues in those aged 16-65, such as information and digital literacy, also impact secondary school children, combined with additional difficulties in training school staff, lack of time in the curriculum and poor engagement.</p>

          <p>I will explore these factors from my perspective as a school librarian of an inner-city school along with feedback from the Head of PSHE and the school nurse.</p>

          <p>It has been encouraging to see the Department for Education (DfE) focusing on health education by making PSHE and RSE programmes statutory in UK schools from September 2020<a name="_ftnref2" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn2" title="">[2]</a>, albeit with a delayed implementation as a result of COVID-19<a name="_ftnref3" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn3" title="">[3]</a>.</p>

          <p>In many schools, such as mine, the PSHE programme has continued regardless but with no change seen in the content or delivery. School librarians are given a backseat in delivering health education, with their involvement confined to providing resources to support students who wish to actively seek out this information.</p>

          <p>Time constraints mean PSHE is often shoe-horned into form time, where it is allocated between 20 minutes to one hour per week. These sessions are delivered by form tutors who mostly have no health background and little time or funding for training. With health information delivered in this way, teachers have observed that students attach less value to the content<a name="_ftnref4" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn4" title="">[4]</a>.</p>

          <p>Whilst some teenagers are engaging more with exercise and healthy eating, physical health in a more medical sense is not a hot topic. Invincibility theory in teenagers plays out with many showing little engagement. When it comes to mental health, however, students display a much keener interest.</p>

          <p>In 2018, students at my school completed a voice exercise about information they wanted to cover in PSHE lessons and the overwhelming response was ‘mental health’. However, teachers found that the term ‘mental health’ itself could be reactive and that ‘delivering content through lesson components such as ‘wellbeing’ and ‘confidence’ were more effective ways of promoting engagement’<a name="_ftnref5" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>.</p>

          <p>Counteracting the barrage of Fake Health News young people are facing as well as poor health behaviours experienced in the family home is problematic. This has been compounded during the past year with school closures.</p>

          <p>My school has focused on running sessions to educate parents such as ‘The Teenage Brain’ but uptake is patchy and often the families who these sessions target are less likely to attend.</p>

          <p>For students with English as an Additional Language (EAL) the barriers to health literacy can be more pronounced. Students new to the UK face huge upheaval but lack the emotional vocabulary to describe mental health issues, which can mean they are less able to access health services. EAL students are also twice as likely to be Young Carers<a name="_ftnref6" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>but school staff are often not immediately able to communicate their needs to school staff.</p>

          <p>It is promising to learn about the pilot Health Literacy project in Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust in collaboration with the School Library Association and I look forward to hearing their findings.</p>

          <p>Perhaps with a more developed and persistent approach to teaching health in an engaging and accessible way whether that be in the classroom or with more involvement from school librarians, we could see a marked improvement in health literacy in young people that would continue into their adult years. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Barriers to Health Literacy</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Andy Lacey</strong></h3>

          <p>Health literacy describes an individual’s ability to comprehend and act upon health information, covering a large set of overlapping difficulties. These include literacy, numeracy, and socioeconomic realities.</p>

          <p>To address skills barriers, the use of e-learning resources provides clinicians and organisations with the tools to present health information in accessible ways <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">https://www.e</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">lfh.org.uk/</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">)</a>.</p>

          <p>Strategies include the ‘teach back’ and ‘chunk and check’ methods, which have become important tool’s for imparting health information. Library and Knowledge Services (LKS) have been vital at imputing evidence into patient information, with some trusts employing Patient Librarians to assist in decoding health information.</p>

          <p>South West , Thames Valley, and Wessex LKS have been especially adept at providing health literacy awareness training for trust staff, building collaborative organisational links; helping to embed health literacy within their respective trusts <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">)</a>.</p>

          <p>In tackling physical access barriers, Health Librarians partnerships with Prison Librarians, was timely. As prisoners often suffer from the cumulative effects of social disadvantage, poor literacy/numeracy skills, and limited access.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The Terrence Higgins Trust has&nbsp;undertaken research to understand how different demographics access health information (Terrence Higgins Trust, 2020) and how they can adjust the delivery of their health information provision to meet different information seeking behaviours.</p>

          <p>Beyond skills and access barriers, there are those caused by stigma. Stigmatisation due to health conditions is a barrier to help seeking behaviour. As Jorm (2012) highlights, due to successful public health campaigns, many people are aware of common signs of serious physical conditions e.g. heart attack or stroke. What is less known is how to identify and tackle mental health conditions.</p>

          <p>People are unprepared to address the signs of mental health conditions, such as depression or schizophrenia; with some stating that sufferers “should spend time in the sun” or “just get on with it” (Jorm, 2012). This demonstrates a reluctance to seek professional help, or knowledge about available support services. The creation of more widespread mental health literacy would help suffers and their families, identify a mental health crisis and seek help.</p>

          <p>Having grown up with a family member who suffers from schizophrenia, useful literacy interventions would have been invaluable. These include, self-help strategies, mental health first aid skills, support for carers, and prevention strategies; through a combination of education, web, and community-based interventions (Jorm, 2012).</p>

          <p>Subsequently, NHS England and Health Education England, launched MindEd e-learning program; which helps people identify, understand and support those with mental health conditions <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">https://www.minded.org.uk/</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">)</a>. This presents a welcome tool for demystifying mental illness for sufferers and their families/carers.</p>

          <p>Mental health services have been subjected to low funding because they do not enjoy the same level of public understanding as other conditions. The COVID pandemic has shone a light on mental health and increased awareness. As a result, spending on mental health services has increased during the pandemic (albeit after years of decline).</p>

          <p>A mental health focus is pertinent to the NHS workforce. After the pandemic subsides, there will be members of staff who need mental health support. So too will increasing members of the public. LKS will be well placed to act as information hubs for the promotion of mental health literacy within their respective trusts and will be invaluable at inputting evidence.</p>

          <p>Signalling their support for colleagues at this critical time also represents cost avoidance for trusts and may help with staff retention post pandemic.</p>

          <p>Whilst some teenagers are engaging more with exercise and healthy eating, physical health in a more medical sense is not a hot topic. Invincibility theory in teenagers plays out with many showing little engagement. When it comes to mental health, however, students display a much keener interest.</p>

          <p>In 2018, students at my school completed a voice exercise about information they wanted to cover in PSHE lessons and the overwhelming response was ‘mental health’. However, teachers found that the term ‘mental health’ itself could be reactive and that ‘delivering content through lesson components such as ‘wellbeing’ and ‘confidence’ were more effective ways of promoting engagement’<a name="_ftnref5" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn5" title="">[5]</a>.</p>

          <p>Counteracting the barrage of Fake Health News young people are facing as well as poor health behaviours experienced in the family home is problematic. This has been compounded during the past year with school closures.</p>

          <p>My school has focused on running sessions to educate parents such as ‘The Teenage Brain’ but uptake is patchy and often the families who these sessions target are less likely to attend.</p>

          <p>For students with English as an Additional Language (EAL) the barriers to health literacy can be more pronounced. Students new to the UK face huge upheaval but lack the emotional vocabulary to describe mental health issues, which can mean they are less able to access health services. EAL students are also twice as likely to be Young Carers<a name="_ftnref6" style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="#_ftn6" title="">[6]</a>but school staff are often not immediately able to communicate their needs to school staff.</p>

          <p>It is promising to learn about the pilot Health Literacy project in Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation Trust in collaboration with the School Library Association and I look forward to hearing their findings.</p>

          <p>Perhaps with a more developed and persistent approach to teaching health in an engaging and accessible way whether that be in the classroom or with more involvement from school librarians, we could see a marked improvement in health literacy in young people that would continue into their adult years. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Barriers to Health Literacy</strong></h2>

          <h3><strong>Andy Lacey</strong></h3>

          <p>Health literacy describes an individual’s ability to comprehend and act upon health information, covering a large set of overlapping difficulties. These include literacy, numeracy, and socioeconomic realities.</p>

          <p>To address skills barriers, the use of e-learning resources provides clinicians and organisations with the tools to present health information in accessible ways <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">https://www.e</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">lfh.org.uk/</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/">)</a>.</p>

          <p>Strategies include the ‘teach back’ and ‘chunk and check’ methods, which have become important tool’s for imparting health information. Library and Knowledge Services (LKS) have been vital at imputing evidence into patient information, with some trusts employing Patient Librarians to assist in decoding health information.</p>

          <p>South West , Thames Valley, and Wessex LKS have been especially adept at providing health literacy awareness training for trust staff, building collaborative organisational links; helping to embed health literacy within their respective trusts <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://southlks.libguides.com/healthliteracy/home">)</a>.</p>

          <p>In tackling physical access barriers, Health Librarians partnerships with Prison Librarians, was timely. As prisoners often suffer from the cumulative effects of social disadvantage, poor literacy/numeracy skills, and limited access.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The Terrence Higgins Trust has&nbsp;undertaken research to understand how different demographics access health information (Terrence Higgins Trust, 2020) and how they can adjust the delivery of their health information provision to meet different information seeking behaviours.</p>

          <p>Beyond skills and access barriers, there are those caused by stigma. Stigmatisation due to health conditions is a barrier to help seeking behaviour. As Jorm (2012) highlights, due to successful public health campaigns, many people are aware of common signs of serious physical conditions e.g. heart attack or stroke. What is less known is how to identify and tackle mental health conditions.</p>

          <p>People are unprepared to address the signs of mental health conditions, such as depression or schizophrenia; with some stating that sufferers “should spend time in the sun” or “just get on with it” (Jorm, 2012). This demonstrates a reluctance to seek professional help, or knowledge about available support services. The creation of more widespread mental health literacy would help suffers and their families, identify a mental health crisis and seek help.</p>

          <p>Having grown up with a family member who suffers from schizophrenia, useful literacy interventions would have been invaluable. These include, self-help strategies, mental health first aid skills, support for carers, and prevention strategies; through a combination of education, web, and community-based interventions (Jorm, 2012).</p>

          <p>Subsequently, NHS England and Health Education England, launched MindEd e-learning program; which helps people identify, understand and support those with mental health conditions <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">(</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">https://www.minded.org.uk/</a><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.minded.org.uk/">)</a>. This presents a welcome tool for demystifying mental illness for sufferers and their families/carers.</p>

          <p>Mental health services have been subjected to low funding because they do not enjoy the same level of public understanding as other conditions. The COVID pandemic has shone a light on mental health and increased awareness. As a result, spending on mental health services has increased during the pandemic (albeit after years of decline).</p>

          <p>A mental health focus is pertinent to the NHS workforce. After the pandemic subsides, there will be members of staff who need mental health support. So too will increasing members of the public. LKS will be well placed to act as information hubs for the promotion of mental health literacy within their respective trusts and will be invaluable at inputting evidence.</p>

          <p>Signalling their support for colleagues at this critical time also represents cost avoidance for trusts and may help with staff retention post pandemic.</p>

          <p>The draft guidance indicated the need for patient decision-making aids, but did not explicitly include patient information materials as resources to support decisions.</p>

          <p>The final guidance states that a decision aid, including information, ‘should only be used if is quality assured and reflects evidence-based best practice’ (1.3.2). This provides an opportunity for conversations about the role that knowledge and library services can play in providing evidence to underpin patient information.

          <p>The guidance states that the core health literacy techniques of ‘Teach Back’ and ‘Chunk and Check’ should be used in discussions when options are being considered (1.2.11). The ‘Teach Back’ and ‘Chunk and Check’ techniques are included in our training on health literacy and are also covered in the health literacy toolkit.</p>

          <p>The new NICE <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/about/what-we-do/our-programmes/nice-guidance/nice-guidelines/shared-decision-making" target="_blank">shared decision making guidance</a> provides an opportunity to promote both the importance of health literacy and the need for evidence-based information for patients and the public.</p>

          <p>The HEE national knowledge and library services team responded on behalf of Health Education England to the draft guidance from NICE, requesting the inclusion of:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Evidence-based patient information to support decisions</li>
           <li>Health literacy</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The draft guidance indicated the need for patient decision-making aids, but did not explicitly include patient information materials as resources to support decisions.</p>

          <p>The final guidance states that a decision aid, including information, ‘should only be used if is quality assured and reflects evidence-based best practice’ (1.3.2). This provides an opportunity for conversations about the role that knowledge and library services can play in providing evidence to underpin patient information. You may wish to use the <a href="making-the-case">Making the Case</a> resources developed by participants in our senior leadership development programme.</p>

          <p>The guidance states that the core health literacy techniques of ‘Teach Back’ and ‘Chunk and Check’ should be used in discussions when options are being considered (1.2.11). The ‘Teach Back’ and ‘Chunk and Check’ techniques are included in our training on health literacy and are also covered in the health literacy toolkit.</p>

          <p>NICE’s shared decision making guidance includes a link to Health Education England’s <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/health-literacy/" target="_blank">health literacy e-learning</a>. We are particularly keen to encourage usage of the health literacy e-learning in parts of the country where there are <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="http://healthliteracy.geodata.uk/" target="_blank">lower levels of health literacy</a>.</p>

          <p>We are working on resources to be used alongside the new NICE guidance. In the meantime, do use the guidance as an opportunity to promote the importance of evidence-based information for patients and health literacy.&nbsp; Find updated resources for <a href="working-with-patients">health literacy and patient information</a>.</p>

          <p>I recently compiled a&nbsp;synopsis of <a href="policy_1">policy recommendations</a>&nbsp;by Health Education England&nbsp;on&nbsp;NHS funded&nbsp;knowledge and library services.</p>

          <p>This was prepared to&nbsp;support ongoing discussions with one of the regulators about the vital contribution that you and your teams make in underpinning decision-making, quality and performance. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>With two iterations of&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/knowledge-for-healthcare" target="_blank">Knowledge for Healthcare</a> and four&nbsp;<a href="policy">policy&nbsp;statements </a>published over the past 7 years, plus input into the new&nbsp;Education contract, we have covered a lot of ground.</p>

          <p>We are making headway in shaping new&nbsp;levers which we can, together, use&nbsp;to&nbsp;help to build the case to expand the reach of NHS knowledge services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The&nbsp;<a href="value-proposition">Gift of Time</a>&nbsp;makes a powerful case in its own right, articulating the value proposition for investment in health libraries. We aim to build on this work with further research in the years ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Schedule 1 of the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract" target="_blank">Education contract 2021-2024</a> requires that&nbsp;Placement Providers ensure that the clinical decision support tool<em>,</em>&nbsp;funded and provided nationally by HEE for all learners and NHS staff, is actively promoted to underpin clinical decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Publication of&nbsp; <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/digitise-connect-transform/what-good-looks-like/" target="_blank">What Good Looks Like</a>,&nbsp;the framework for digital transformation from NHS X, is another new development. It sets as a success measure&nbsp;that each ICS will&nbsp;“ensure that organisations across your ICS employ decision support and other tools to help clinicians follow best practice and eliminate quality variation across the entire pathway”.</p>

          <p>This is another helpful lever for promoting uptake of&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.bmj.com/company/hee/" target="_blank">BMJ Best Practice</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I’m really interested to hear how you are using these various statements, and whether there are other themes it would be useful for us to address if we can? Let me know. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>In the wider policy context, the draft&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0140/210140.pdf" target="_blank">Health and Care Bill</a>&nbsp;confers a duty in respect of research. Each integrated care board must, in the exercise of its functions, promote the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research.</p>

          <p>Following several discussions with DHSC, it is reassuring that we will be able to cite the Bill as part of our continuing&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/marketing-and-campaigns">#AMillionDecisions</a>&nbsp;campaign. This is a joint Health Education England - CILIP Health Libraries Group initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The establishment of the ICS creates a new landscape, new opportunities. We are currently drawing up a modular outline business case. This will provide a ‘template’ that you can use, adapt and improve to support your local plans to deliver knowledge and library services across the ICS footprint. It will be coming out to you in a matter of weeks. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>Schedule 1 of the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract" target="_blank">Education contract 2021-2024</a> requires that&nbsp;Placement Providers ensure that the clinical decision support tool<em>,</em>&nbsp;funded and provided nationally by HEE for all learners and NHS staff, is actively promoted to underpin clinical decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Publication of&nbsp; <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/digitise-connect-transform/what-good-looks-like/" target="_blank">What Good Looks Like</a>,&nbsp;the framework for digital transformation from NHS X, is another new development. It sets as a success measure&nbsp;that each ICS will&nbsp;“ensure that organisations across your ICS employ decision support and other tools to help clinicians follow best practice and eliminate quality variation across the entire pathway”.</p>

          <p>This is another helpful lever for promoting uptake of&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.bmj.com/company/hee/" target="_blank">BMJ Best Practice</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I’m really interested to hear how you are using these various statements, and whether there are other themes it would be useful for us to address if we can? Let me know. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>In the wider policy context, the draft&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/58-02/0140/210140.pdf" target="_blank">Health and Care Bill</a>&nbsp;confers a duty in respect of research. Each integrated care board must, in the exercise of its functions, promote the use in the health service of evidence obtained from research.</p>

          <p>Following several discussions with DHSC, it is reassuring that we will be able to cite the Bill as part of our continuing&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/marketing-and-campaigns">#AMillionDecisions</a>&nbsp;campaign. This is a joint Health Education England - CILIP Health Libraries Group initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The establishment of the ICS creates a new landscape, new opportunities. We are currently drawing up a modular outline business case. This will provide a ‘template’ that you can use, adapt and improve to support your local plans to deliver knowledge and library services across the ICS footprint. It will be coming out to you in a matter of weeks. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>You may&nbsp;also link to <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="levers-for-change">levers for change</a> which we can all use to promote the difference that your knowledge and library services make to healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Research is firmly embedded in the NHS Mandate 2017 – 2018 (see Objective 8 “To support research, innovation and growth”).</p>

          <p>It probably didn’t need a directive to point out the importance of research to patients and patient care. Research is also core business for NHS libraries.</p>

          <p>This is a reflection on how we can make research a distinctive part of our service offering. It’s based on personal experience and best practice using the tried and tested ‘n things’ model.</p>

          <ol>
           <li><strong>Go to the Research Committee</strong> It’s a safe bet that no one ends their career wishing they had gone to more meetings. However, in something as diverse as research in a large organisation the Research Committee can be the best place to get an overview of current and new research activity. If you are not on the committee as a member, you could ask to be an observer or to be circulated the minutes.</li>
           <li><strong>Collaborate with your Research Department </strong>If you can make friends with your nearby Research Department team there are opportunities to collaborate on events or projects to make life a little easier (and fun?) for your organisation’s researchers. Mid Cheshire are planning a <a href="http://www.mcht.nhs.uk/research/jetlibrary/expo/">Research Expo</a> for June and Wirral are coordinating a Randomsied Chocolate Trial to celebrate this year’s International Clinical Trials Day (May 19).</li>
           <li><strong>Host your organization’s publications database</strong> Creating a database exists at on a continuum starting with a quick and dirty solution using freemium reference software (<a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/nwas_electronic_research_database_nerd">Zotero</a> / Mendeley) and ends with <a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/knowledge-management/knowledge-management-story/institutional-repository/index.html">Institutional Repository</a>. The library is the natural home for this project. It also contributes to Knowledge Management objective viz, c<em>onnecting with corporate knowledge, mapping knowledge assets; collating and enabling shared access to directories; policies, guidance and protocols. </em>Knowledge about the usefulness of a database or Institutional Repository will vary so it may just be a case of <em>carpe diem </em>or getting on with it.</li>
           <li><strong>Be the source of information about the research landscape</strong> Make the library the centre for information about research methods, academic writing, training courses, support for research, regional and national organisations, newsletters, research information on social media. You could add this into your social media, current awareness mix or set up a separate space for researchers. (See NWAS LKS <a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/knowledge-management/knowledge-management-story/yammer-at-nwas/index.html">Case Study on using Yammer</a>).</li>
           <li><strong>Be the publications expert for your trust</strong> Publication isn’t as easy as it was. There are choices and decisions to be made. Choosing Open Access (Green/Gold), avoiding predatory publishers, fulfilling funding requirements, funding Article Publication Fees (APCs), navigating journal rankings, choosing appropriate journals, copyright, promoting your research and more. Being the expert and the place to go for information for help adds real value, especially for early career researchers.</li>
           <li><strong>Offer researchers a bespoke service</strong> Clearly all our users are at heart researchers from the humble diploma to post doctoral students. Even if it doesn’t change the service you offer badging part of your service as for researchers can make promoting the library to the research community easier and give you a seat at the research table. This also fits with LQAF <em>5.3i Library/knowledge service staff support the research activities of the organisation[s] served.</em></li>
           <li><strong>Develop your research skills </strong>Nothing helps you to understand the viewpoint of a researcher better than being one yourself. Opportunities for librarians to get involved in research are out there, and may vary from co-authoring a systematic review to getting to grips with qualitative research methodology (<a href="https://kfh.libraryservices.nhs.uk/clinical-librarians-really-make-a-difference-2/index.html">as did a bunch of clinical librarians from the NW not long ago</a>).</li>
          </ol>

          <p>It’s <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23HealthLiteracyMonth&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">#HealthLiteracyMonth</a> – a worldwide event which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.</p>

          <p>Knowledge and Library Services (KLS) in the healthcare sector know how crucial good Health Literacy skills are for underpinning patient decision-making and co-creation of care. These skills enable the public (inclusive of all gender, cultural and intellectual backgrounds and abilities) to access and process information in a way which allows them to take ownership of their long-term health and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>Previous Health Literacy communities of practice in the north and south successfully allowed for the sharing of knowledge and abilities amongst KLS colleagues to support skills training for staff and students, and subsequently outwards to the public and health information colleagues in other sectors.</p>

          <p>Today we are building on this by launching one national cohesive community of practice. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>Meet the Chair and Vicechairs, discover the value of the group for them, what they bring to it, and what they hope we will achieve together:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Siobhan Linsey – Chair</p>

          <p>Health Literacy is a professional passion of mine. I have been actively involved in this work-stream from 2018 by designing and delivering training to students, volunteers, public library colleagues, and healthcare staff groups at all levels, plus sharing learning at conferences.</p>

          <p>Supporting skills in this area is a rewarding aspect of my job, and collaborating with and learning from others is key to maximising successes and achieving the widespread impact that this work will have. I look forward to learning what has worked well across the country - even small successes can be inspiring and give me confidence to try things out. There’s great value in sharing innovations and exploring ideas, so I’m hoping many of you will come on board and encourage others to do likewise.</p>

          <p>Lorna Dawson – Vicechair North</p>

          <p>I’ve delivered Health Literacy Awareness training virtually on a monthly basis for a year so am bringing that experience to the group. I feel like I can share almost every way Teams will try to foil your training session so you know what to expect in advance! I’ve been very lucky to be able to test-run my slides within my own team but not everyone has that luxury so I’m also bringing the offer of a friendly first audience and critical friend to anyone who needs it.</p>

          <p>My vision for the group is that it will be a safe space that helps people’s confidence to grow, and that it will be a hub of ideas for delivering health literacy training. Personally, I’m hoping to benefit from people’s experience delivering the training ‘in the real world’ as I’ve not done that yet!</p>

          <p>Lynsey Southern – Vicechair South</p>

          <p>Southern – Vicechair South When I started looking at health literacy back in 2019 it felt big, and at times overwhelming, so many questions ran through my mind when I first began looking to implement sessions into my setting, amongst them how to get the message heard, but more importantly actioned and embedded.</p>

          <p>This is why I became a part of the new national Health Literacy community of practice (COP) – I want to be a part of a national community where everyone is included, enabled, confident and empowered. To find our collective voices, armed with evidence and facts to improve outcomes for patients. But to know that we are there to support one another and that when you speak about the importance of health literacy, there is a whole community behind you.</p>

          <p>Health Literacy activism can take many forms, from sharing social media posts to standing up and sharing the impacts of poor health literacy with senior stakeholders. All have impact. All are valid forms of educating our teams, delivering within our means and capabilities.</p>

          <p>There is incredible work already taking place across the country, and through our national COP I want us to acknowledge, celebrate and share existing best practice, share our successes and give those of us that are starting out on the Health Literacy journey the tools, skills and knowledge to confidently step forward and start that conversation.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Network with others in your profession and support this key information life skill for patient and public long-term health and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>Join us: First virtual meeting 9th November 2021 – booking link will be emailed out nationally.</p>

          <p>Share your thoughts: How do you feel about delivering health literacy or promoting it?

          <p>Thank you to all who completed the 2021&nbsp;Local&nbsp;eResources&nbsp;and Systems Audit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The audit recorded purchases in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have analysed the 133 returns received&nbsp;and also&nbsp;compared the data with the 2019 audit.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This data influences national spend on&nbsp;eresources.&nbsp; For example, we used the data from the 2019 audit to successfully make the case for national procurement of BMJ Best Practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have also used it to negotiate deals for electronic resources to which a high number of KLS subscribe based on our preferred FTE pricing model.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This model aims to reduce variations in pricing&nbsp;for similar sized Trusts&nbsp;and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;make costs more equitable and transparent across KLS.&nbsp; The model bases pricing of&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;FTE staff numbers&nbsp;of the workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Recent examples&nbsp;include&nbsp;the Wiley Medicine and Nursing Collection, the pricing for which is tiered based on FTEs of the medical and nursing workforce, the Royal Marsden Manual of Clinical Nursing Procedures and the Mark Allen Group’s&nbsp;ejournal&nbsp;collections.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Highlights from the 2021 audit&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>To enable like-for-like comparisons, we have used the data only from those KLS which completed returns for both the 2019 and 2021 audits.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Not all KLS submitted cost data, so total spend will be higher&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>We received 25 fewer returns than in 2019, a 15.8% drop.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Total&nbsp;spend was £8,839,112 a 15.2% increase on 2019 in KLS completing both audits.&nbsp; This is most likely due to one-off additional money related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>FTE analysis&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>We have also analysed the data by FTEs and Cost/FTE using national workforce data from NHS Digital.&nbsp; This is to show any variations in pricing.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Where costs were declared, the cost has been divided by total workforce FTEs for the organisation for which the resource was purchased.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The minimum to maximum cost/FTE has been shown for small, medium, large and super-sized Trusts.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The differences between the minimum and maximum cost/FTE&nbsp;is&nbsp;largest in point of care tools and smallest in databases.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>HEE will continue to talk to suppliers about reducing variations is pricing and to adopt our preferred pricing model of FTEs of the relevant workforce.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>An anonymised version of the data is available on the HEE SharePoint site.&nbsp; This values only spreadsheet does not show individual Trust or KLS data.&nbsp; It is for use by KLS staff only.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Thank you to all who completed the 2021&nbsp;Local&nbsp;eResources&nbsp;and Systems Audit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The audit recorded purchases in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have analysed the 133 returns received&nbsp;and also&nbsp;compared the data with the 2019 audit.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This data influences national spend on&nbsp;eresources.&nbsp; For example, we used the data from the 2019 audit to successfully make the case for national procurement of BMJ Best Practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have also used it to negotiate deals for electronic resources to which a high number of KLS subscribe based on our preferred FTE pricing model.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This model aims to reduce variations in pricing&nbsp;for similar sized Trusts&nbsp;and&nbsp;therefore&nbsp;make costs more equitable and transparent across KLS.&nbsp; The model bases pricing of&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;FTE staff numbers&nbsp;of the workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Recent examples&nbsp;include&nbsp;the Wiley Medicine and Nursing Collection, the pricing for which is tiered based on FTEs of the medical and nursing workforce, the Royal Marsden Manual of Clinical Nursing Procedures and the Mark Allen Group’s&nbsp;ejournal&nbsp;collections.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Highlights from the 2021 audit&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>To enable like-for-like comparisons, we have used the data only from those KLS which completed returns for both the 2019 and 2021 audits.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Not all KLS submitted cost data, so total spend will be higher&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>We received 25 fewer returns than in 2019, a 15.8% drop.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Total&nbsp;spend was £8,839,112 a 15.2% increase on 2019 in KLS completing both audits.&nbsp; This is most likely due to one-off additional money related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Spend and organisational access&nbsp;of selected&nbsp;eresource&nbsp;types&nbsp;</h3>

           </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Consortial&nbsp;spend&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>There was also an&nbsp;102% increase in spend where&nbsp;eresources&nbsp;were bought as part of consortia to £1,013,699.&nbsp;&nbsp;313&nbsp;organisations have access to resources bought through consortial arrangements.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>HEE negotiated&nbsp;deals&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>There have been increases&nbsp;in the number of&nbsp;organisations with access to the&nbsp;resources where HEE has negotiated national deals:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Royal Marsden Manual (+12)&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>MAH Complete (+24)&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Wiley Medical and Nursing Collection (+12)&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>KnowledgeShare&nbsp;(+23)&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Numbers show increases in the number of organisations with access where KLS have completed both the 2019 and 2021 audits.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Mental Health and Community Care&nbsp;</h3>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Total reported spend in KLS serving mental health and community care was £1,176,305&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Spend in KLS serving mental health alone was £350,144&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Spend in KLS serving community care alone was £72,325&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Suppliers&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>The five biggest suppliers remain Wolters Kluwer, EBSCO, Wiley, Elsevier and Mark Allen.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>FTE analysis&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>We have also analysed the data by FTEs and Cost/FTE using national workforce data from NHS Digital.&nbsp; This is to show any variations in pricing.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Where costs were declared, the cost has been divided by total workforce FTEs for the organisation for which the resource was purchased.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The minimum to maximum cost/FTE has been shown for small, medium, large and super-sized Trusts.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The differences between the minimum and maximum cost/FTE&nbsp;is&nbsp;largest in point of care tools and smallest in databases.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>HEE will continue to talk to suppliers about reducing variations is pricing and to adopt our preferred pricing model of FTEs of the relevant workforce.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>An anonymised version of the data is available on the HEE SharePoint site.&nbsp; This values only spreadsheet does not show individual Trust or KLS data.&nbsp; It is for use by KLS staff only.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If you would like to access the analysis, contact kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk.</p>

          <h2><strong>Pilot&nbsp;NHS Shared Repository&nbsp;now&nbsp;live!&nbsp;</strong></h2>

          <p>Funded by HEE&nbsp;and hosted by the British Library,&nbsp;a&nbsp;beta version of&nbsp;NHS Shared Repository is now live at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nhs.iro.bl.uk./" target="_blank">https://nhs.iro.bl.uk.</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The&nbsp;12-month project&nbsp;to develop and evaluate&nbsp;the repository&nbsp;commenced&nbsp;in June&nbsp;2021&nbsp;and involves&nbsp;six sites: Barts Health&nbsp;NHS Trust, Birmingham &amp; Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, a consortium of Black Country libraries, Gloucestershire Hospitals&nbsp;NHS Foundation Trust, Somerset NHS&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;Trust, and the Norfolk &amp;&nbsp;Waveney&nbsp;Integrated Care System.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Tim&nbsp;Jacobs,&nbsp;Online Resources&nbsp;Librarian&nbsp;at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, has been seconded to the role of&nbsp;NHS Repository Co-ordinator&nbsp;and is working with the pilot sites and the British Library to develop&nbsp;and populate&nbsp;the repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The repository uses the&nbsp;Open Source&nbsp;software,&nbsp;Samvera&nbsp;Hyku, which is jointly provided through a contract with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/fHWoCPzAms3jKgPhz73fp?domain=gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com" target="_blank">CoSector</a> and&nbsp;Notch8.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A key aim&nbsp;of the pilot is to&nbsp;capture&nbsp;‘near research’&nbsp;and ‘grey literature’&nbsp;which&nbsp;contains valuable learning from practice but&nbsp;is&nbsp;typically&nbsp;less readily discoverable&nbsp;than formally published research.&nbsp;&nbsp;As colleagues know, repositories&nbsp;can be integrated&nbsp;into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub:&nbsp;the ambulance research&nbsp;repository,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amber.openrepository.com/" target="_blank">amber,</a>&nbsp;has already been&nbsp;included,&nbsp;so this could be a future option for this repository.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The repository&nbsp;now includes&nbsp;over 1,000 records.&nbsp;Whilst still very much in development,&nbsp;we would&nbsp;value your&nbsp;thoughts:&nbsp;please&nbsp;take a look&nbsp;and let us know!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Open Access work with NIHR&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Earlier&nbsp;this year, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) published its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/" target="_blank">policy</a>&nbsp;on open access publishing of UKRI-funded research.&nbsp;We expect the NHS&nbsp;National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to publish&nbsp;their own updated,&nbsp;aligned policy&nbsp;relating to NIHR-funded research&nbsp;very soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Thanks largely&nbsp;to the work of Jisc, the academic community in the&nbsp;UK increasingly benefit from transformative&nbsp;(‘read and publish’)&nbsp;agreements with&nbsp;journal&nbsp;publishers. Currently these do not extend to&nbsp;NIHR-funded researchers&nbsp;from&nbsp;outside the academic community, and as we know, NHS researchers&nbsp;and potential researchers&nbsp;may struggle to&nbsp;obtain NIHR funding&nbsp;or indeed any&nbsp;means to pay to publish in open access journals, so continue to publish in subscription journals&nbsp;for which&nbsp;the NHS must pay to&nbsp;enable access.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Collectively, we have some&nbsp;way to go to ‘building structural equity’ in the NHS!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>As a first step, the NIHR is working with Jisc to&nbsp;explore how their transformative agreements might be extended to all NIHR-funded authors.&nbsp;HEE is contributing to&nbsp;this work.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Open access publishing continues to be of much interest to library leaders&nbsp;in health and social care sector, and on 16 November, HEE&nbsp;is hosting&nbsp;a&nbsp;roundtable&nbsp;discussion with representatives of the newly formed&nbsp;Health &amp; Social Care Forum* and speakers from NIHR and Jisc to continue the debate.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Feedback? Questions?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Please e-mail&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:helene.gorring@hee.nhs.uk" target="_blank">helene.gorring@hee.nhs.uk</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Funded by HEE&nbsp;and hosted by the British Library,&nbsp;a&nbsp;beta version of&nbsp;NHS Shared Repository is now live at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nhs.iro.bl.uk./" target="_blank">https://nhs.iro.bl.uk.</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The&nbsp;12-month project&nbsp;to develop and evaluate&nbsp;the repository&nbsp;commenced&nbsp;in June&nbsp;2021&nbsp;and involves&nbsp;six sites: Barts Health&nbsp;NHS Trust, Birmingham &amp; Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, a consortium of Black Country libraries, Gloucestershire Hospitals&nbsp;NHS Foundation Trust, Somerset NHS&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;Trust, and the Norfolk &amp;&nbsp;Waveney&nbsp;Integrated Care System.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Tim&nbsp;Jacobs,&nbsp;Online Resources&nbsp;Librarian&nbsp;at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust, has been seconded to the role of&nbsp;NHS Repository Co-ordinator&nbsp;and is working with the pilot sites and the British Library to develop&nbsp;and populate&nbsp;the repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The repository uses the&nbsp;Open Source&nbsp;software,&nbsp;Samvera&nbsp;Hyku, which is jointly provided through a contract with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/fHWoCPzAms3jKgPhz73fp?domain=gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com" target="_blank">CoSector</a> and&nbsp;Notch8.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A key aim&nbsp;of the pilot is to&nbsp;capture&nbsp;‘near research’&nbsp;and ‘grey literature’&nbsp;which&nbsp;contains valuable learning from practice but&nbsp;is&nbsp;typically&nbsp;less readily discoverable&nbsp;than formally published research.&nbsp;&nbsp;As colleagues know, repositories&nbsp;can be integrated&nbsp;into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub:&nbsp;the ambulance research&nbsp;repository,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amber.openrepository.com/" target="_blank">amber,</a>&nbsp;has already been&nbsp;included,&nbsp;so this could be a future option for this repository.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The repository&nbsp;now includes&nbsp;over 1,000 records.&nbsp;Whilst still very much in development,&nbsp;we would&nbsp;value your&nbsp;thoughts:&nbsp;please&nbsp;take a look&nbsp;and let us know!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Open Access work with NIHR&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Earlier&nbsp;this year, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) published its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukri.org/publications/ukri-open-access-policy/" target="_blank">policy</a>&nbsp;on open access publishing of UKRI-funded research.&nbsp;We expect the NHS&nbsp;National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) to publish&nbsp;their own updated,&nbsp;aligned policy&nbsp;relating to NIHR-funded research&nbsp;very soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Thanks largely&nbsp;to the work of Jisc, the academic community in the&nbsp;UK increasingly benefit from transformative&nbsp;(‘read and publish’)&nbsp;agreements with&nbsp;journal&nbsp;publishers. Currently these do not extend to&nbsp;NIHR-funded researchers&nbsp;from&nbsp;outside the academic community, and as we know, NHS researchers&nbsp;and potential researchers&nbsp;may struggle to&nbsp;obtain NIHR funding&nbsp;or indeed any&nbsp;means to pay to publish in open access journals, so continue to publish in subscription journals&nbsp;for which&nbsp;the NHS must pay to&nbsp;enable access.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Collectively, we have some&nbsp;way to go to ‘building structural equity’ in the NHS!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>As a first step, the NIHR is working with Jisc to&nbsp;explore how their transformative agreements might be extended to all NIHR-funded authors.&nbsp;HEE is contributing to&nbsp;this work.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Open access publishing continues to be of much interest to library leaders&nbsp;in health and social care sector, and on 16 November, HEE&nbsp;is hosting&nbsp;a&nbsp;roundtable&nbsp;discussion with representatives of the newly formed&nbsp;Health &amp; Social Care Forum* and speakers from NIHR and Jisc to continue the debate.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

        hippostd:content: <p>It is about ensuring healthcare organisations, services
          and systems are effectively connected to use evidence, learning, knowledge
          and ‘know-how’ to enable evidence-based policy and practice.&nbsp; Evidence
          comes in many different forms – evidence from published peer-reviewed research
          papers, grey literature, data sets, statistics and organisational knowledge
          in the form of policies, manuals, procedures.&nbsp; Healthcare workers need
          to be connected to these sources of evidence and knowledge plus connected
          to other people who hold expert knowledge, ‘know-how’ and values.&nbsp;
          The knowledge specialist role is therefore that of connector – saving healthcare
          staff time by connecting them to the right knowledge and evidence, at the
          right time and in the right place enabling effective use of a full range
          of knowledge and evidence to inform decisions for better care.</p>

          <h2>How to be a good connector?&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>If you go back to first principles of librarianship as outlined by Ranganathan’s Five Laws of Library Sciencei&nbsp;librarians and knowledge specialists have the perfect skill set to act as connectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ranganathan’s first law is fundamental “Books are for use” and the most critical aspect of knowledge mobilisation is the&nbsp;use&nbsp;of evidence and knowledge.&nbsp; Sharing, gathering, compiling and curating knowledge are all important steps but connecting people to knowledge and encouraging the re-use of knowledge is what will make the difference to decision making ensuring that good practice is replicated, expanded and pitfalls avoided.&nbsp; In 2019 B. Shadrach adapted these laws to suit the knowledge-based societyii.&nbsp; He highlights that knowledge is for use in all forms and continues by explaining that “every human being is a knowledge resource&nbsp;today”(Shadrach, 2019 p 36).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Therefore, connecting people to people is as important as connecting people to evidence resources.&nbsp; To help make good use of these connections there are a range of tools and techniques that you can use and some of these are described in the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/" target="_blank">NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework e-learning and postcards</a>.&nbsp; For example, the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/KM-Framework-Postcards-AAR-2019.pdf" target="_blank">After Action Review</a>&nbsp;technique provides structure to connect people together for a facilitated conversation to discover lessons learned throughout a piece of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The fourth law is about saving the time of all knowledge seekers.&nbsp; As connectors the knowledge specialist role is about presenting knowledge at the right time and in a format that makes it “easily accessible, digestible and actionable” (Shadrach, 2019 p 36).&nbsp; Within health we produce summaries of evidence and gather actionable insights from knowledge sharing activities taking the ‘heavy lifting’ out of getting evidence and knowledge into practice and giving the gift of timeiii&nbsp;to our healthcare colleagues.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To regard the knowledge and library service as a growing organism, the fifth of Ranganthan’s laws, knowledge mobilisation should be seen as dynamic – ever shifting to meet the needs of not just individuals but also organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Building your own connections&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Why not use this November as the chance to build your own connections?&nbsp; Networking is a key skill which we all need to develop but this needs regular practice. There is no magic formula to networking, it is about being curious about what other people do, talking to others and sharing experiences and ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Having a wide range of connections gives you the opportunity to have a vast array of knowledge at your fingertips. If you think about 6 degrees of separation, the idea that all people are six or fewer social connections away from each otheriv,&nbsp;networking is a great way to build connections that in turn can help to provide a different viewpoint or solution to a challenge we are facing.&nbsp; We are living in a very connected world, and it is now easier than ever to follow someone on Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn - you may not ever have a conversation with them, but you can connect to see what they are up to and learn about them and their interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The benefits of having a wide group of connections both within our own organisation and in the wider Knowledge and Library profession can help you in several surprising ways.&nbsp; Here are a couple of examples from Nicki’s own practice:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>You can act as the “middleman”.&nbsp; Knowledge and library services are spaces where connections happen, hubs of information and the people to contact when help or support are required.&nbsp; I can recall a phone call asking about a particular issue that someone needed help with and although I did not know the answer myself, I was able to put them in touch with someone that did. It is important to remember that knowledge mobilisation can come in many forms – your knowledge as a specialist is highly regarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Whilst working on a project, my colleague did not know enough about how to use MS Excel to develop reports. I knew of a data analyst who I connected with my colleague which resulted in developing a template to improve accurate reporting.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>How to be a good connector?&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>If you go back to first principles of librarianship as outlined by Ranganathan’s Five Laws of Library Sciencei&nbsp;librarians and knowledge specialists have the perfect skill set to act as connectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Ranganathan’s first law is fundamental “Books are for use” and the most critical aspect of knowledge mobilisation is the&nbsp;use&nbsp;of evidence and knowledge.&nbsp; Sharing, gathering, compiling and curating knowledge are all important steps but connecting people to knowledge and encouraging the re-use of knowledge is what will make the difference to decision making ensuring that good practice is replicated, expanded and pitfalls avoided.&nbsp; In 2019 B. Shadrach adapted these laws to suit the knowledge-based societyii.&nbsp; He highlights that knowledge is for use in all forms and continues by explaining that “every human being is a knowledge resource&nbsp;today”(Shadrach, 2019 p 36).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;Therefore, connecting people to people is as important as connecting people to evidence resources.&nbsp; To help make good use of these connections there are a range of tools and techniques that you can use and some of these are described in the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/" target="_blank">NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework e-learning and postcards</a>.&nbsp; For example, the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/KM-Framework-Postcards-AAR-2019.pdf" target="_blank">After Action Review</a>&nbsp;technique provides structure to connect people together for a facilitated conversation to discover lessons learned throughout a piece of work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The fourth law is about saving the time of all knowledge seekers.&nbsp; As connectors the knowledge specialist role is about presenting knowledge at the right time and in a format that makes it “easily accessible, digestible and actionable” (Shadrach, 2019 p 36).&nbsp; Within health we produce summaries of evidence and gather actionable insights from knowledge sharing activities taking the ‘heavy lifting’ out of getting evidence and knowledge into practice and giving the gift of timeiii&nbsp;to our healthcare colleagues.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To regard the knowledge and library service as a growing organism, the fifth of Ranganthan’s laws, knowledge mobilisation should be seen as dynamic – ever shifting to meet the needs of not just individuals but also organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Building your own connections&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Why not use this November as the chance to build your own connections?&nbsp; Networking is a key skill which we all need to develop but this needs regular practice. There is no magic formula to networking, it is about being curious about what other people do, talking to others and sharing experiences and ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Having a wide range of connections gives you the opportunity to have a vast array of knowledge at your fingertips. If you think about 6 degrees of separation, the idea that all people are six or fewer social connections away from each otheriv,&nbsp;networking is a great way to build connections that in turn can help to provide a different viewpoint or solution to a challenge we are facing.&nbsp; We are living in a very connected world, and it is now easier than ever to follow someone on Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn - you may not ever have a conversation with them, but you can connect to see what they are up to and learn about them and their interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The benefits of having a wide group of connections both within our own organisation and in the wider Knowledge and Library profession can help you in several surprising ways.&nbsp; Here are a couple of examples from Nicki’s own practice:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>You can act as the “middleman”.&nbsp; Knowledge and library services are spaces where connections happen, hubs of information and the people to contact when help or support are required.&nbsp; I can recall a phone call asking about a particular issue that someone needed help with and although I did not know the answer myself, I was able to put them in touch with someone that did. It is important to remember that knowledge mobilisation can come in many forms – your knowledge as a specialist is highly regarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Whilst working on a project, my colleague did not know enough about how to use MS Excel to develop reports. I knew of a data analyst who I connected with my colleague which resulted in developing a template to improve accurate reporting.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Having information colleagues based in other sectors can be a huge benefit when you want to find out about how they have approached something like introducing a knowledge mobilisation technique like a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/KM-Framework-Postcards-PA-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Peer Assist</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Asking questions on a social media platform can help you connect with a broader range of people and get a broader range of responses&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Sharing your own learning is also a key part of networking.&nbsp; You may be uncertain about sharing your own reflections or knowledge, but you can guarantee someone will find it helpful to learn from how you approached something.&nbsp; Think about how you can share your learning perhaps in a blog post, newsletter, podcast or more formal article.&nbsp; You may find structuring your reflections around one of the knowledge mobilisation techniques such as the Retrospect helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To regard the knowledge and library service as a growing organism, the fifth of Ranganthan’s laws, knowledge mobilisation should be seen as dynamic – ever shifting to meet the needs of not just individuals but also organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Building your own connections&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Why not use this November as the chance to build your own connections?&nbsp; Networking is a key skill which we all need to develop but this needs regular practice. There is no magic formula to networking, it is about being curious about what other people do, talking to others and sharing experiences and ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Having a wide range of connections gives you the opportunity to have a vast array of knowledge at your fingertips. If you think about 6 degrees of separation, the idea that all people are six or fewer social connections away from each otheriv,&nbsp;networking is a great way to build connections that in turn can help to provide a different viewpoint or solution to a challenge we are facing.&nbsp; We are living in a very connected world, and it is now easier than ever to follow someone on Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn - you may not ever have a conversation with them, but you can connect to see what they are up to and learn about them and their interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The benefits of having a wide group of connections both within our own organisation and in the wider Knowledge and Library profession can help you in several surprising ways.&nbsp; Here are a couple of examples from Nicki’s own practice:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>You can act as the “middleman”.&nbsp; Knowledge and library services are spaces where connections happen, hubs of information and the people to contact when help or support are required.&nbsp; I can recall a phone call asking about a particular issue that someone needed help with and although I did not know the answer myself, I was able to put them in touch with someone that did. It is important to remember that knowledge mobilisation can come in many forms – your knowledge as a specialist is highly regarded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Whilst working on a project, my colleague did not know enough about how to use MS Excel to develop reports. I knew of a data analyst who I connected with my colleague which resulted in developing a template to improve accurate reporting.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Having information colleagues based in other sectors can be a huge benefit when you want to find out about how they have approached something like introducing a knowledge mobilisation technique like a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/KM-Framework-Postcards-PA-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Peer Assist</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Asking questions on a social media platform can help you connect with a broader range of people and get a broader range of responses&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Sharing your own learning is also a key part of networking.&nbsp; You may be uncertain about sharing your own reflections or knowledge, but you can guarantee someone will find it helpful to learn from how you approached something.&nbsp; Think about how you can share your learning perhaps in a blog post, newsletter, podcast or more formal article.&nbsp; You may find structuring your reflections around one of the knowledge mobilisation techniques such as the Retrospect helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Connecting top tips&nbsp;</strong></h2>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Within your organisation get involved and attend a wide range of events&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Attend committees or groups – this way you will have the opportunity to develop your skills along with meeting new people&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Shadow those working in different or similar roles to get an insight into their work&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Most importantly talk to people. I will admit that this can be scary at first, and it does take courage to go up and say hello. You can always find some common ground and these discussion areas may help:&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Discussing the event, meeting contents or a generalised topic&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>At conferences and events approach a speaker that you have just listened to&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Channel the Queen – what do you do?&nbsp; have you come far?&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>And if all else fails - yes, you have guessed it the weather&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Follow people who are specialist in their field on social media, ask questions and respond if they ask you a question.&nbsp; Don’t be shy in sharing your ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Take part or run a Randomised Coffee Trial so that you can chat to a new colleague&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>You can start building your connections by taking up the #KNOWvember21 Challenge:&nbsp;</p>

          <ol start="1">
           <li>
           <p>Connect with three new colleagues, this can be done via email, social media, you can always start with us&nbsp;😊&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <ol start="2">
           <li>
           <p>Write up your reflections from what you have learnt over #KNOWvember21 and get these published perhaps in a newsletter, blog or journal. If you are worried about doing this on your own think about a joint article with a colleague&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ol>

          <p>There are lots of definitions,&nbsp;but&nbsp;here is an excerpt of&nbsp;one I felt kinship with:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>“Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-science-introduction" target="_blank">IBM (2020)</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Much like our library collections, data needs to be curated and managed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data sets&nbsp;need to be&nbsp;critically&nbsp;evaluated, analysed,&nbsp;and presented&nbsp;so we can&nbsp;gain knowledge and learning&nbsp;from them.&nbsp;Check out this&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3paOmcrTjQ" target="_blank">day in the life video</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;consider the&nbsp;similarities with&nbsp;managing evidence!&nbsp;The&nbsp;definitions also state that&nbsp;data&nbsp;science is multidisciplinary.&nbsp; Whilst&nbsp;it&nbsp;might not be obvious why a librarian might&nbsp;consider developing&nbsp;programming skills or advanced&nbsp;analytics,&nbsp;we do need to understand the basics and have a common language&nbsp;so we can work together to improve patient care.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Recently I talked to&nbsp;Quality Nursing Leads about how the library could support them in making data discoverable.  They had created an MS&nbsp;Teams page for wards to share falls and pressure-ulcer data and were looking at how to make it searchable by specialty and ward.  In an earlier meeting on quality improvement, we had been discussing&nbsp;creating&nbsp;a QI Hub where people could search data, research, lessons learned and patient experience videos.  It was the first time any of us found out there was a searchable data portal in the Trust. This led to the question “could&nbsp;knowledge and library specialists&nbsp;help to make date more accessible?”  My response:&nbsp;I am a librarian I catalogue things. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>Later&nbsp;we were asked if we could do something similar for policies and procedures.  This felt more comfortable ground, but it got me thinking.  As librarians and knowledge mobilisers we work daily with information, it usually comes in the form of reports and research papers, but information and knowledge can also be presented in terms of dashboards, Statistical&nbsp;Process&nbsp;Control (SPC)&nbsp;charts and river diagrams. I’ve sat in many a meeting where people have referred to evidence in the forms of data and been frustrated it hasn’t included the literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many librarians would&nbsp;know how to run a search on gene sequences&nbsp;or other bioinformatics&nbsp;data?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In countries like&nbsp;the&nbsp;USA and China, the role of data librarianship is well established.&nbsp; CILIP now promotes&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/general/custom.asp?page=DataScience" target="_blank">different roles</a>&nbsp;in data science.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;wouldn’t be a&nbsp;long&nbsp;stretch for health libraries to&nbsp;catalogue&nbsp;data, teach data searching&nbsp;and&nbsp;appraisal, advise&nbsp;on bias in data collection and curation/stewardship&nbsp;of data libraries like the books and journals we have in our collections now.&nbsp; Some of you are already engaged in this kind of work e.g.&nbsp;in repositories,&nbsp;critical appraisal training,&nbsp;library&nbsp;chat bots&nbsp;or&nbsp;Mersey Care’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/a-glimpse-of-the-future--iris-ai-in-mersey-care-evidence-service" target="_blank">Iris.Ai</a>&nbsp;to search open source papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Work has begun between&nbsp;Health Education England,&nbsp;Academy for Healthcare Sciences and Manchester University to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;PG Cert in Clinical Data Science.&nbsp;This will be an exciting multidisciplinary course,&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;the&nbsp;basic&nbsp;data&nbsp;skills&nbsp;mentioned.  We already have people who have these skills,&nbsp;or an interest in emerging technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we will be launching a new Data Science community of practice.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will&nbsp;help&nbsp;us to&nbsp;identify what work we are already doing,&nbsp;develop case studies to share the learning,&nbsp;and identify future training needs to support extending services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>You might think that you don’t use data science tools, but have you tried the concept-mapping one in EBSCO&nbsp;Discovery?  It has a nice little piece of machine-learning code which helps us visualise the information and demonstrates their relationships.  Wouldn’t it be good if, when&nbsp;I searched for pressure ulcers, it could return not only an evidence summary and research articles but placed it alongside the data sets and videos of patient experience and lessons learned?  We would see it in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wider&nbsp;context,&nbsp;and&nbsp;this would provide us with&nbsp;an opportunity for additional learning.  In a shared system this becomes more powerful.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>When first researching the topic, I was interested to find the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-ethics-framework" target="_blank">Data Ethics Framework</a> advocates for sharing the learning and was quick to check that the ideas in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://learninghealthcareproject.org/realising-the-potential-of-learning-health-systems/" target="_blank">Releasing The Potential of Learning Health Systems</a> was captured in the Knowledge Mobilisation workstream.  I was happy to learn the lead investigator for the report, Tom Foley, had been invited to present as part of #Knowvember2021.  I found the paper thought-provoking, inspirational,&nbsp;and scary in equal measure.  Although lengthy, it is a very accessible read with some great explanations of tools and concepts which have&nbsp;already helped me build new connections.  It provides an excellent model&nbsp;for&nbsp;how&nbsp;Knowledge and Library Services&nbsp;can work with colleagues&nbsp;in&nbsp;our organisations to help&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;knowledge from data into practice and drive quality improvement in the NHS.  It is a reminder that NHS X’s<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/data-saves-lives/" target="_blank"> Data&nbsp;Saves&nbsp;Lives</a> needs to contextualise the data into a form which can be shared, and we can learn from.  I am certainly using the report to leverage my own library service’s&nbsp;development and inform future strategy. &nbsp;Future roles within data sciences will be based on some very old skills developed by librarians, placed in new settings.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There are lots of definitions,&nbsp;but&nbsp;here is an excerpt of&nbsp;one I felt kinship with:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>“Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.”&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-science-introduction" target="_blank">IBM (2020)</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Much like our library collections, data needs to be curated and managed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data sets&nbsp;need to be&nbsp;critically&nbsp;evaluated, analysed,&nbsp;and presented&nbsp;so we can&nbsp;gain knowledge and learning&nbsp;from them.&nbsp;Check out this&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3paOmcrTjQ" target="_blank">day in the life video</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;consider the&nbsp;similarities with&nbsp;managing evidence!&nbsp;The&nbsp;definitions also state that&nbsp;data&nbsp;science is multidisciplinary.&nbsp; Whilst&nbsp;it&nbsp;might not be obvious why a librarian might&nbsp;consider developing&nbsp;programming skills or advanced&nbsp;analytics,&nbsp;we do need to understand the basics and have a common language&nbsp;so we can work together to improve patient care.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Recently I talked to&nbsp;Quality Nursing Leads about how the library could support them in making data discoverable.  They had created an MS&nbsp;Teams page for wards to share falls and pressure-ulcer data and were looking at how to make it searchable by specialty and ward.  In an earlier meeting on quality improvement, we had been discussing&nbsp;creating&nbsp;a QI Hub where people could search data, research, lessons learned and patient experience videos.  It was the first time any of us found out there was a searchable data portal in the Trust. This led to the question “could&nbsp;knowledge and library specialists&nbsp;help to make date more accessible?”  My response:&nbsp;I am a librarian I catalogue things. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>Later&nbsp;we were asked if we could do something similar for policies and procedures.  This felt more comfortable ground, but it got me thinking.  As librarians and knowledge mobilisers we work daily with information, it usually comes in the form of reports and research papers, but information and knowledge can also be presented in terms of dashboards, Statistical&nbsp;Process&nbsp;Control (SPC)&nbsp;charts and river diagrams. I’ve sat in many a meeting where people have referred to evidence in the forms of data and been frustrated it hasn’t included the literature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How many librarians would&nbsp;know how to run a search on gene sequences&nbsp;or other bioinformatics&nbsp;data?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In countries like&nbsp;the&nbsp;USA and China, the role of data librarianship is well established.&nbsp; CILIP now promotes&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/general/custom.asp?page=DataScience" target="_blank">different roles</a>&nbsp;in data science.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;wouldn’t be a&nbsp;long&nbsp;stretch for health libraries to&nbsp;catalogue&nbsp;data, teach data searching&nbsp;and&nbsp;appraisal, advise&nbsp;on bias in data collection and curation/stewardship&nbsp;of data libraries like the books and journals we have in our collections now.&nbsp; Some of you are already engaged in this kind of work e.g.&nbsp;in repositories,&nbsp;critical appraisal training,&nbsp;library&nbsp;chat bots&nbsp;or&nbsp;Mersey Care’s&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/a-glimpse-of-the-future--iris-ai-in-mersey-care-evidence-service" target="_blank">Iris.Ai</a>&nbsp;to search open source papers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Work has begun between&nbsp;Health Education England,&nbsp;Academy for Healthcare Sciences and Manchester University to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;PG Cert in Clinical Data Science.&nbsp;This will be an exciting multidisciplinary course,&nbsp;teaching&nbsp;the&nbsp;basic&nbsp;data&nbsp;skills&nbsp;mentioned.  We already have people who have these skills,&nbsp;or an interest in emerging technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon we will be launching a new Data Science community of practice.&nbsp; This&nbsp;will&nbsp;help&nbsp;us to&nbsp;identify what work we are already doing,&nbsp;develop case studies to share the learning,&nbsp;and identify future training needs to support extending services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>As we reach the end of November it is time to pause and reflect not only on the activities and events of #KNOWvember21 but also to recognise the value of mobilising evidence and knowledge&nbsp;in the health service&nbsp;and how this is core to underpinning the future of health systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Using the month of November to&nbsp;share ideas and showcase the many ways NHS librarians and knowledge specialists mobilise evidence and knowledge started in 2018 and is now a firm fixture in the calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This year we have focused upon growing connections: holding randomised coffee trials, joining virtual journal clubs, connecting with those interested in&nbsp;CILIP&nbsp;KM chartership and fellowship, honing our ability to reflect and developing skills to inject fun interactions into our virtual meetings.&nbsp; We have taken part in knowledge exchanges to hear about the latest research and understand how the armed forces approach knowledge mobilisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Thank you to everyone who has put up a display, shared a tweet, held an event, contributed to the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://padlet.com/HEE_KLS_/4bqzvwv8g60j6ev8" target="_blank">Padlet</a>, had a conversation, presented or taken part in a webinar – we hope you have enjoyed the month.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>What next?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>Knowledge&nbsp;Mobilisation&nbsp;is not just for November.&nbsp; We will continue to run&nbsp;training&nbsp;sessions on using the Knowledge Mobilisation Self-Assessment Tool and look out in the new year for training in how&nbsp;to engage with senior leaders about the tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Work&nbsp;is underway testing how we can&nbsp;gather impact to demonstrate the value of knowledge mobilisation activities and we will be working&nbsp;more closely with&nbsp;our Knowledge Champions to maintain the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-community-of-practice" target="_blank">KM Community of Practice</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use your unique skills and expertise to mobilise knowledge continue to develop&nbsp;and we recognise an opportunity to assist with the work taking place across the country on&nbsp;preparing for the COVID-19&nbsp;Public&nbsp;Inquiry.&nbsp; Rachel Cooke explains&nbsp;about her involvement at Surrey and Sussex&nbsp;Healthcare NHS Trust:&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">"When my trust was made aware of the Covid-19 Public Inquiry and the need to collect and organise all local Covid related evidence&nbsp;i.e.&nbsp;documentation and correspondence; I was approached by our Chief of Staff &amp; Corporate Governance and Head of Corporate Governance for assistance both in the recruitment of the Trust Covid-19 Inquiry Lead and to provide insight and experience of&nbsp;what they knew would be a complex piece of work to collect and capture the necessary information.  A piece of work that they recognised involved a significant amount of knowledge management and the cataloguing of evidence from&nbsp;across&nbsp;the Trust.  I was pleased that they identified that these were skills that the library and knowledge service had. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">I have already met with the person taking on the Lead role to provide her with some tips on things to consider when collating and recording the information&nbsp;-&nbsp;thinking&nbsp;about how you might need to retrieve the information (date, topic, type of asset, owner) and tag each item accordingly, and consistency of tagging. Things that we take for granted but don’t occur to most people&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">The Covid-19 Inquiry is an opportunity to demonstrate to your organisation that the skills of their&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;library and knowledge specialists can be applied in contexts beyond that of organising of books on library shelves."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>As this type of work will be new to most&nbsp;of&nbsp;us&nbsp;we&nbsp;see the value in&nbsp;organising&nbsp;an event to share ideas and approaches to encourage you to get involved, once again demonstrating the business-critical nature of your expertise.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We also welcome your feedback and ideas so do share what more you would like to see by posting to the KM&nbsp;Community&nbsp;of Practice or contact us direct&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:alison.day@hee.nhs.uk" target="_blank">alison.day@hee.nhs.uk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:nicki.forgham-healey@hee.nhs.uk" target="_blank">nicki.forgham-healey@hee.nhs.uk</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>As we reach the end of November it is time to pause and reflect not only on the activities and events of #KNOWvember21 but also to recognise the value of mobilising evidence and knowledge&nbsp;in the health service&nbsp;and how this is core to underpinning the future of health systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Using the month of November to&nbsp;share ideas and showcase the many ways NHS librarians and knowledge specialists mobilise evidence and knowledge started in 2018 and is now a firm fixture in the calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This year we have focused upon growing connections: holding randomised coffee trials, joining virtual journal clubs, connecting with those interested in&nbsp;CILIP&nbsp;KM chartership and fellowship, honing our ability to reflect and developing skills to inject fun interactions into our virtual meetings.&nbsp; We have taken part in knowledge exchanges to hear about the latest research and understand how the armed forces approach knowledge mobilisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The launch of the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/self-assessment-tool/training-resources" target="_blank">digital Knowledge Mobilisation Self-Assessment Tool</a>, which will help us to work more closely with our healthcare colleagues to identify their priorities to make better use of evidence and knowledge to meet their organisational priorities was a highlight.&nbsp; As was hearing more from Dr Tom Foley and appreciating the opportunities that may lie ahead with contributing our expertise to realise the potential of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://learninghealthcareproject.org/realising-the-potential-of-learning-health-systems/" target="_blank">Learning Health Systems</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Something re-iterated by Susan Smith in her blog post&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-from-data" target="_blank">Knowledge as Data</a>&nbsp;which considers how&nbsp;the&nbsp;knowledge and learning&nbsp;from within data-sets needs to be analysed and summarised so it can be used alongside other forms of evidence and knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          @Brettleali&nbsp;<a href="mailto:a.brettle@salford.ac.uk"><u>a.brettle@salford.ac.uk</u></a> <u>a.brettle@salford.ac.uk</u></p>

          <p>One of the proudest moments for me professionally this month was the publication of a study which demonstrates the impact of clinical librarians in the North West.&nbsp; The paper has been a long time coming so it was very exciting to see it finally in print (or should that be online!).&nbsp; The paper (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hir.12136/abstract">Brettle, Maden and Payne, 2016</a>) was the result of a number of years work and collaboration between clinical librarians working in the North West and myself.</p>

          <p>The project really began in 2009, when I returned from the <a href="http://www.eblip4.unc.edu/">EBLIP4 conference </a>in North Carolina. As <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/about-lihnn">LIHNN</a> had kindly sponsored my conference fees I wrote an article in <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/lihnnk-up/read-the-newsletter">LIHNNK Up</a> about the conference, expressing some frustration about the lack of evidence within our profession. My practical way forward was to suggest librarians conducted systematic reviews so we would know what evidence there was – and where the gaps were.&nbsp; I also strongly believed that getting involved in systematic reviews was a good introduction to research. The <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/lihnn-groups/clinical-librarians">clinical librarians group </a>in the North West were interested in publishing more about the work they were doing and they got in touch, and to cut a long story short, this was the beginning of a partnership which resulted in the group undertaking a systematic review on evaluating clinical librarian services (Brettle et al, 2011).&nbsp; The systematic review updated the evidence on effectiveness as well as highlighting what was needed to provide rigorous evidence to demonstrate the impact of clinical librarian services.&nbsp; The next logical step was to put these findings into practice and conduct an evaluation across the North West.&nbsp; This was to be the largest clinical librarian study in the UK to date, and all clinical librarians across the region were invited to participate.&nbsp; Both these studies benefited from small grants from <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/hclu-top/about-hclu">HCLU</a>, which were key to providing a small amount of resources to get the projects off the ground.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.eblip4.unc.edu/">EBLIP4 conference </a> <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/about-lihnn">LIHNN</a> <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/lihnnk-up/read-the-newsletter">LIHNNK Up</a> <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/lihnn-groups/clinical-librarians">clinical librarians group </a> <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/hclu-top/about-hclu">HCLU</a></p>

          <p>Building on the recommendations from our systematic review, our aim was to understand the impacts of CL services within National Health Service (NHS) organisations, by</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Using a framework that ensured consistent and robust data collection across all participants</li>
           <li>Testing the Making Alignment a Priority (MAP) Toolkit (https://maptoolkit.wordpress.com) in measuring the CL contribution to organisational objectives</li>
           <li>Developing research skills amongst the group of librarians involved.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>Using a framework that ensured consistent and robust data collection across all participants</li>
           <li>Testing the Making Alignment a Priority (MAP) Toolkit (https://maptoolkit.wordpress.com) in measuring the CL contribution to organisational objectives</li>
           <li>Developing research skills amongst the group of librarians involved.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The paper describes the results and the tools used. Using both questionnaires and interviews, we found that the interventions or services provided by CL’s are complex and each contributes to multiple outcomes of importance to their organisation.&nbsp; So for example each literature search or participation in a journal club or current awareness bulletin could impact on multiple areas and decisions, and will be unique to each encounter.&nbsp; We found that the questionnaires were useful in providing data about the outcomes to which the librarians contributed, whilst the interviews really brought this data to life, explaining how one piece of information could really contribute in a wide range of ways that are important within the NHS context.</p>

          <p>In brief we found that clinical librarians contribute to a wide range of outcomes in the short and longer term and really do make a difference within the NHS. These include direct contributions to choice of intervention (36%) diagnosis (26%) quality of life (25%), increased patient involvement in decision making (26%) and cost savings and risk management including avoiding tests, referrals, readmissions and reducing length of stay (28%).&nbsp; As well as looking at contributions to patient care, we looked at other outcomes that are important within the NHS (this is where the MAP toolkit came in), so the study is relevant across all types of NHS organisations not just acute patient care.&nbsp; We were able to show that clinical librarians improve quality and help save money as well as affecting patient care directly – all key outcomes in the current NHS climate.</p>

          <p>The third objective of the study was to help improve research skills, and this isn’t really covered in the paper.&nbsp; The approach we used built on that used in the systematic review project (Brettle et al, 2011) and has since been described as a “hive approach” (Buckley-Woods and Booth, 2013).&nbsp; Another way of describing it is “doing with” rather than “doing for”. As an experienced researcher I directed and guided the research but it was very much a partnership and mentoring relationship where the clinical librarians really contributed to the research (and it wouldn’t have taken place if they hadn’t done so).&nbsp; For this project the clinical librarians were invited to take part in the research at a level that worked for them.&nbsp; For example, some participated in the survey part whereas others took part in the interviews, interview analysis, and writing up the results.&nbsp; At the questionnaire design stage, a small group drafted the questionnaire, as a group this was discussed and modified to suit everyone’s needs, and then piloted on each service.&nbsp; Standard documents were developed and provided to all, on how to conduct the pilot and how to obtain ethical and governance approval.&nbsp; Meetings were used for agreeing procedures and training.&nbsp; A wiki was used to share and update resources.&nbsp; At the interview stage, meetings were held to develop the interview schedule and provide training to those taking part in this stage.&nbsp; Librarians were “buddied” and conducted interviews in each others organisations (to enhance rigour) but with the advantage that the buddies could practice on each other as well as bounce ideas (and fears!).</p>

          <p>The tools developed in the project have informed the development of a simpler generic tool for use across all health libraries and have been incorporated in a revised impact toolkit, for those who want to conduct more in-depth, rigorous impact studies.&nbsp; In terms of further research what we need to do next is find out whether this approach of building research capacity has made a difference in the longer term.&nbsp; If this is the case we can use this approach more widely to develop the evidence base of health libraries and librarians for the future.</p>

My practical way forward was to suggest librarians conducted systematic reviews so we would know what evidence there was – and where the gaps were.&nbsp; I also strongly believed that getting involved in systematic reviews was a good introduction to research. The <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/lihnnhome/lihnn-groups/clinical-librarians">clinical librarians group </a>in the North West were interested in publishing more about the work they were doing and they got in touch, and to cut a long story short, this was the beginning of a partnership which resulted in the group undertaking a systematic review on evaluating clinical librarian services (Brettle et al, 2011).&nbsp; The systematic review updated the evidence on effectiveness as well as highlighting what was needed to provide rigorous evidence to demonstrate the impact of clinical librarian services.&nbsp; The next logical step was to put these findings into practice and conduct an evaluation across the North West.&nbsp; This was to be the largest clinical librarian study in the UK to date, and all clinical librarians across the region were invited to participate.&nbsp; Both these studies benefited from small grants from <a href="http://www.lihnn.nhs.uk/index.php/hclu-top/about-hclu">HCLU</a>, which were key to providing a small amount of resources to get the projects off the ground.</p>

          <p>Building on the recommendations from our systematic review, our aim was to understand the impacts of CL services within National Health Service (NHS) organisations, by</p>

           <li>Testing the Making Alignment a Priority (MAP) Toolkit (https://maptoolkit.wordpress.com) in measuring the CL contribution to organisational objectives</li>
           <li>Developing research skills amongst the group of librarians involved.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The paper describes the results and the tools used. Using both questionnaires and interviews, we found that the interventions or services provided by CL’s are complex and each contributes to multiple outcomes of importance to their organisation.&nbsp; So for example each literature search or participation in a journal club or current awareness bulletin could impact on multiple areas and decisions, and will be unique to each encounter.&nbsp; We found that the questionnaires were useful in providing data about the outcomes to which the librarians contributed, whilst the interviews really brought this data to life, explaining how one piece of information could really contribute in a wide range of ways that are important within the NHS context.</p>

          <p>In brief we found that clinical librarians contribute to a wide range of outcomes in the short and longer term and really do make a difference within the NHS. These include direct contributions to choice of intervention (36%) diagnosis (26%) quality of life (25%), increased patient involvement in decision making (26%) and cost savings and risk management including avoiding tests, referrals, readmissions and reducing length of stay (28%).&nbsp; As well as looking at contributions to patient care, we looked at other outcomes that are important within the NHS (this is where the MAP toolkit came in), so the study is relevant across all types of NHS organisations not just acute patient care.&nbsp; We were able to show that clinical librarians improve quality and help save money as well as affecting patient care directly – all key outcomes in the current NHS climate.</p>

          <p>The third objective of the study was to help improve research skills, and this isn’t really covered in the paper.&nbsp; The approach we used built on that used in the systematic review project (Brettle et al, 2011) and has since been described as a “hive approach” (Buckley-Woods and Booth, 2013).&nbsp; Another way of describing it is “doing with” rather than “doing for”. As an experienced researcher I directed and guided the research but it was very much a partnership and mentoring relationship where the clinical librarians really contributed to the research (and it wouldn’t have taken place if they hadn’t done so).&nbsp; For this project the clinical librarians were invited to take part in the research at a level that worked for them.&nbsp; For example, some participated in the survey part whereas others took part in the interviews, interview analysis, and writing up the results.&nbsp; At the questionnaire design stage, a small group drafted the questionnaire, as a group this was discussed and modified to suit everyone’s needs, and then piloted on each service.&nbsp; Standard documents were developed and provided to all, on how to conduct the pilot and how to obtain ethical and governance approval.&nbsp; Meetings were used for agreeing procedures and training.&nbsp; A wiki was used to share and update resources.&nbsp; At the interview stage, meetings were held to develop the interview schedule and provide training to those taking part in this stage.&nbsp; Librarians were “buddied” and conducted interviews in each others organisations (to enhance rigour) but with the advantage that the buddies could practice on each other as well as bounce ideas (and fears!).</p>

          <p>The tools developed in the project have informed the development of a simpler generic tool for use across all health libraries and have been incorporated in a revised impact toolkit, for those who want to conduct more in-depth, rigorous impact studies.&nbsp; In terms of further research what we need to do next is find out whether this approach of building research capacity has made a difference in the longer term.&nbsp; If this is the case we can use this approach more widely to develop the evidence base of health libraries and librarians for the future.</p>

          <p>One of the proudest moments for me professionally this month was the publication of a study which demonstrates the impact of clinical librarians in the North West.&nbsp; The paper has been a long time coming so it was very exciting to see it finally in print (or should that be online!).&nbsp; The paper (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hir.12136/abstract">Brettle, Maden and Payne, 2016</a>) was the result of a number of years work and collaboration between clinical librarians working in the North West and myself.</p>

          <p>by Caroline De Brún, PhD, DipLIS<br />
          October 2019</p>

          <p>People of all ages, backgrounds, and education levels need health information, but often find it difficult to find and understand. Low literacy levels, in terms of reading, and being able to find, understand, and apply information, are a barrier to successful patient participation, and this is problematic, given the increasing recognition about the importance of engaging patients in the treatment decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Health literacy and health information literacy are phrases that are becoming more widely used, sometimes interchangeably. However, there is a difference, and this post hopes to clarify the meaning of each.</p>

          <h2><strong>Health literacy</strong></h2>

          <p>Health literacy is the ability to understand instructions provided by health professionals. “In England, 42% of working-age adults are unable to understand and make use of everyday health information, rising to 61% when numeracy skills are also required for comprehension” (1), and “around one in five adults cannot read or understand simple instructions or labels such as those found on medicine bottles” (2, 3). The inability to read can result in patients taking medicines at the wrong times, not following dosages correctly, or not understanding instructions properly (4). For example, if the label on the prescription says “Take three tablets daily”, does this mean take three tablets at the same time or take one tablet three times a day? The quote in the box below, comes from a Facebook post written by a surgeon, and perfectly illustrates the consequences of misunderstanding medical instructions.</p>

          <h2><strong>Health information literacy</strong></h2>

          <p>Health information literacy, although often referred to as health literacy, has a more in-depth scope. It is not only about access to the Internet and online health information, but also about having the skills required by people to effectively recognise:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>what they need to know about their condition and treatment options,</li>
           <li>how to find that information, to fill those knowledge gaps,</li>
           <li>how to appraise the information to ensure it is good quality, and relevant to their personal context, and then</li>
           <li>how to use the information with their health professionals so that they can make an informed decision that suits their needs (5, 6).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Poor health information literacy can result in poorer health outcomes, unhealthy lifestyles, increased incidence of chronic conditions and mortality, greater use of emergency services, and increased hospital stays (1, 7-13).</p>

          <h2><strong>Role of librarians</strong></h2>

          <p>Maimonides, a Spanish philosopher said “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” This quote reflects the importance of health information literacy, because if you find the information for the patient, their query will be satisfied, but if you teach them to search and appraise, they will be able to make informed decisions throughout their care pathways.</p>

          <p>Health information literacy is an area where librarians, from all sectors, whether medical, public or academic, are in a strong position to support. They already have the resources, skills, and processes in place (14). Librarians can signpost people to the best sources, and teach them to search, retrieve, and appraise what they find (15). Medical librarians have the skills associated with evidence-based practice, as it is embedded in their roles, their primary function being teaching health professionals how to find and appraise the evidence. They also have access to the</p>

          <p>relevant information sources, while public and school librarians are a trusted source within their communities, and understand the local context. Working in partnership would improve access to good quality health information at a location accessible to local people, who most likely would not have access to medical libraries.</p>

          <p>People benefit from having access to good quality health information because it enables them to make informed decisions and follow their treatment regimens more effectively and safely (16-18). Informed patients are more likely to comply with the treatment regime, resulting in improved health, and reduced length of stay, and hospital admissions. Since the average doctor’s visit in England lasts 8-10 minutes (19), patients need to be ready to ask the right questions. Helping patients to self-manage by improving their health information literacy skills will benefit both the patient and the health system (1, 20, 21). By improving access to clear, current, accurate, and understandable consumer health information, health inequalities can be reduced and patients will feel more empowered (1, 22).</p>

          <p>Creating health information literacy support programmes and resources is a new area for medical, public, and school libraries to work and lead on together. Library communities would benefit, in terms of professional development, more efficient working practices, and demonstrating value to the community. Patients could see improved health outcomes and better quality of life, health, and wellbeing, while health services might see a reduction in health service utilisation.</p>

          October 2019</p>

          <p>People of all ages, backgrounds, and education levels need health information, but often find it difficult to find and understand. Low literacy levels, in terms of reading, and being able to find, understand, and apply information, are a barrier to successful patient participation, and this is problematic, given the increasing recognition about the importance of engaging patients in the treatment decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Health literacy and health information literacy are phrases that are becoming more widely used, sometimes interchangeably. However, there is a difference, and this post hopes to clarify the meaning of each.</p>

          <h2><strong>Health literacy</strong></h2>

          <p>Health literacy is the ability to understand instructions provided by health professionals. “In England, 42% of working-age adults are unable to understand and make use of everyday health information, rising to 61% when numeracy skills are also required for comprehension” (1), and “around one in five adults cannot read or understand simple instructions or labels such as those found on medicine bottles” (2, 3). The inability to read can result in patients taking medicines at the wrong times, not following dosages correctly, or not understanding instructions properly (4). For example, if the label on the prescription says “Take three tablets daily”, does this mean take three tablets at the same time or take one tablet three times a day? The quote in the box below, comes from a Facebook post written by a surgeon, and perfectly illustrates the consequences of misunderstanding medical instructions.</p>

          <h2><strong>Health information literacy</strong></h2>

          <p>Health information literacy, although often referred to as health literacy, has a more in-depth scope. It is not only about access to the Internet and online health information, but also about having the skills required by people to effectively recognise:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>what they need to know about their condition and treatment options,</li>
           <li>how to find that information, to fill those knowledge gaps,</li>
           <li>how to appraise the information to ensure it is good quality, and relevant to their personal context, and then</li>
           <li>how to use the information with their health professionals so that they can make an informed decision that suits their needs (5, 6).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Poor health information literacy can result in poorer health outcomes, unhealthy lifestyles, increased incidence of chronic conditions and mortality, greater use of emergency services, and increased hospital stays (1, 7-13).</p>

          <h2><strong>Role of librarians</strong></h2>

          <p>Maimonides, a Spanish philosopher said “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” This quote reflects the importance of health information literacy, because if you find the information for the patient, their query will be satisfied, but if you teach them to search and appraise, they will be able to make informed decisions throughout their care pathways.</p>

          <p>Health information literacy is an area where librarians, from all sectors, whether medical, public or academic, are in a strong position to support. They already have the resources, skills, and processes in place (14). Librarians can signpost people to the best sources, and teach them to search, retrieve, and appraise what they find (15). Medical librarians have the skills associated with evidence-based practice, as it is embedded in their roles, their primary function being teaching health professionals how to find and appraise the evidence. They also have access to the</p>

          <p>relevant information sources, while public and school librarians are a trusted source within their communities, and understand the local context. Working in partnership would improve access to good quality health information at a location accessible to local people, who most likely would not have access to medical libraries.</p>

          <p>People benefit from having access to good quality health information because it enables them to make informed decisions and follow their treatment regimens more effectively and safely (16-18). Informed patients are more likely to comply with the treatment regime, resulting in improved health, and reduced length of stay, and hospital admissions. Since the average doctor’s visit in England lasts 8-10 minutes (19), patients need to be ready to ask the right questions. Helping patients to self-manage by improving their health information literacy skills will benefit both the patient and the health system (1, 20, 21). By improving access to clear, current, accurate, and understandable consumer health information, health inequalities can be reduced and patients will feel more empowered (1, 22).</p>

          <p>Creating health information literacy support programmes and resources is a new area for medical, public, and school libraries to work and lead on together. Library communities would benefit, in terms of professional development, more efficient working practices, and demonstrating value to the community. Patients could see improved health outcomes and better quality of life, health, and wellbeing, while health services might see a reduction in health service utilisation.</p>

          <p>Poor health information literacy can result in poorer health outcomes, unhealthy lifestyles, increased incidence of chronic conditions and mortality, greater use of emergency services, and increased hospital stays (1, 7-13).</p>

          <h2><strong>Role of librarians</strong></h2>

          <p>Maimonides, a Spanish philosopher said “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.” This quote reflects the importance of health information literacy, because if you find the information for the patient, their query will be satisfied, but if you teach them to search and appraise, they will be able to make informed decisions throughout their care pathways.</p>

          <p>Health information literacy is an area where librarians, from all sectors, whether medical, public or academic, are in a strong position to support. They already have the resources, skills, and processes in place (14). Librarians can signpost people to the best sources, and teach them to search, retrieve, and appraise what they find (15). Medical librarians have the skills associated with evidence-based practice, as it is embedded in their roles, their primary function being teaching health professionals how to find and appraise the evidence. They also have access to the</p>

          <p>relevant information sources, while public and school librarians are a trusted source within their communities, and understand the local context. Working in partnership would improve access to good quality health information at a location accessible to local people, who most likely would not have access to medical libraries.</p>

          <p>People benefit from having access to good quality health information because it enables them to make informed decisions and follow their treatment regimens more effectively and safely (16-18). Informed patients are more likely to comply with the treatment regime, resulting in improved health, and reduced length of stay, and hospital admissions. Since the average doctor’s visit in England lasts 8-10 minutes (19), patients need to be ready to ask the right questions. Helping patients to self-manage by improving their health information literacy skills will benefit both the patient and the health system (1, 20, 21). By improving access to clear, current, accurate, and understandable consumer health information, health inequalities can be reduced and patients will feel more empowered (1, 22).</p>

          <p>Creating health information literacy support programmes and resources is a new area for medical, public, and school libraries to work and lead on together. Library communities would benefit, in terms of professional development, more efficient working practices, and demonstrating value to the community. Patients could see improved health outcomes and better quality of life, health, and wellbeing, while health services might see a reduction in health service utilisation.</p>

          <p>We are the first NHS organisation to use Iris, a “young” AI with a primary function of Chemistry R&amp;D although throughout the pandemic it has been used for COVID-19 research. The software is currently made up of two elements called Explore and Focus, Focus mode is essentially a way of refining your search results so below I will focus on the Explore mode; the search function of Iris.</p>

          <p>We bought Iris in an off-the-shelf format; it has read and continues to read all Open Access papers (there is a more expensive option which allows it to read all your online holdings). In reading papers Iris can understand keywords, concepts, context and relationships which it can then map against all the other papers it has read. This theoretically changes the nature of searching as the AI will be able to identify relevant papers that might not contain the keywords used in a more traditional search.</p>

          <p>The first thing to note when using Iris is that it uses natural language processing (NLP). Essentially, the software wants you to type your question in a normal, fluent format. This is a seismic change for librarians used to honing search questions to the bare number of keywords; Iris wants you to enter between 300 to 500 words. When inputting your question Iris is identifying keywords and context that it will match in the information it has read. A library user isn’t going to deliver their search question in this format so the librarian either needs a strong understanding of the subject area or a dialogue with the user to get the context that IRIS needs to function. On submitting a search question IRIS will create a fingerprint of your results comprised of concepts it has identified.</p>

          <p>We negotiated our deal with Iris at the start of 2020 with a start date of 1st April; so as with many things our use has been affected by COVID-19 as our team priorities shifted and our opportunity for collaborative learning decreased. In this current state the software is a very specialised tool, in no way intended for your library user or student and even for information professionals it presents a steep learning curve asking us to reformulate questions in a way that might feel unnatural to us. We use Iris concurrently with HDAS; so in this sense it is not saving us research time however it does add depth to our searches finding relevant papers that are not returned through standard methods.</p>

          <p>As I mentioned earlier Iris is still “young” at version 6.0 and will continue to develop and grow, with an exciting future already outlined. Essentially we are asking not what Iris can do for us today but what we may do together in the future. Moreover investing in Iris, and our other technologies has not only directly benefitted the service but has also help change the perception and profile of the evidence service in the wider organisation, in this sense embodying change, progress and technology can never be a wasted investment.</p>

          <p>As an information professional I feel duty bound to continually improve the service I deliver and as a manager I feel it is my responsibility to drive change in my services instead of waiting for change to happen to us. Feeling buoyed by our success in launching our browser extension <a href="https://www.leanlibrary.com/">Lean Library</a> in 2019 we began to explore implementing some form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into our service.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.leanlibrary.com/">Lean Library</a></p>

          <p>When researching AI options we backed away from a customer facing search tool as this technology currently lacks the sophistication to handle more than two search terms. Also within the service we already offer our users a variety of access points into the evidence base: HDAS, Discovery tool, our browser extension. So, we had to ask ourselves whether adding another search tool would benefit our users or overwhelm them?</p>

          <p>We began to think more deeply about how AI could benefit our service. The primary focus of our team is the creation of evidence reviews: a rapid synthesised literature search available to anyone in the organisation. They are increasingly popular and while our Trust has doubled in size over the last few years the Evidence Service staff numbers have remained static. This growing tension between demand and supply led us to explore whether there was anyway AI could help us in carrying out these searches; this led us to <a href="https://iris.ai/">Iris.ai</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="https://iris.ai/">Iris.ai</a></p>

          <p>We are the first NHS organisation to use Iris, a “young” AI with a primary function of Chemistry R&amp;D although throughout the pandemic it has been used for COVID-19 research. The software is currently made up of two elements called Explore and Focus, Focus mode is essentially a way of refining your search results so below I will focus on the Explore mode; the search function of Iris.</p>

          <p>We bought Iris in an off-the-shelf format; it has read and continues to read all Open Access papers (there is a more expensive option which allows it to read all your online holdings). In reading papers Iris can understand keywords, concepts, context and relationships which it can then map against all the other papers it has read. This theoretically changes the nature of searching as the AI will be able to identify relevant papers that might not contain the keywords used in a more traditional search.</p>

          <p>The first thing to note when using Iris is that it uses natural language processing (NLP). Essentially, the software wants you to type your question in a normal, fluent format. This is a seismic change for librarians used to honing search questions to the bare number of keywords; Iris wants you to enter between 300 to 500 words. When inputting your question Iris is identifying keywords and context that it will match in the information it has read. A library user isn’t going to deliver their search question in this format so the librarian either needs a strong understanding of the subject area or a dialogue with the user to get the context that IRIS needs to function. On submitting a search question IRIS will create a fingerprint of your results comprised of concepts it has identified.</p>

          <p>We negotiated our deal with Iris at the start of 2020 with a start date of 1st April; so as with many things our use has been affected by COVID-19 as our team priorities shifted and our opportunity for collaborative learning decreased. In this current state the software is a very specialised tool, in no way intended for your library user or student and even for information professionals it presents a steep learning curve asking us to reformulate questions in a way that might feel unnatural to us. We use Iris concurrently with HDAS; so in this sense it is not saving us research time however it does add depth to our searches finding relevant papers that are not returned through standard methods.</p>

          <p>As I mentioned earlier Iris is still “young” at version 6.0 and will continue to develop and grow, with an exciting future already outlined. Essentially we are asking not what Iris can do for us today but what we may do together in the future. Moreover investing in Iris, and our other technologies has not only directly benefitted the service but has also help change the perception and profile of the evidence service in the wider organisation, in this sense embodying change, progress and technology can never be a wasted investment.</p>

          <p>One of the hot topics at work just now is cultural change.&nbsp; I am now a part of the Psychological Safety and Civility Group.&nbsp; John Gale has done numerous searches on the human factors of change management, building trust etc to support the Organisational Development Team and the fledging Quality Improvement Faculty.&nbsp; Recovery from Covid has implemented a new ‘Building Back Better’ agenda, which is a new age of thinking about things differently.</p>

          <p>It has made me think a lot about my own personal journey and how things change.</p>

          <p>My first 10 years in libraries began back at The Barony when I was evening library assistant at a Further Education College.&nbsp; It was back in the days of the card catalogue and Brown’s system for issuing books (little cardboard wallets). When I moved into public libraries in East Ayrshire, we were cutting edge with a photocharger system – we took photos of the books and sent the film away to get developed, we did have computers and I taught BBC webwise as a pre-cursor to European Computer Driving Licence.&nbsp; When I moved into the NHS we were the first place in the hospital to get a computer and it was used to manually load Medline by disks sent out monthly.&nbsp; We still had a print copy of Index Medicus kicking around the office, so no matter how frustrating it was we appreciated the new database there was no way we were going back. New search interfaces were developed and soon I was programming websites, working on apps and digitising journals.</p>

          <p>My last decade has been in the same organisation. &nbsp;We are just in the process of purchasing our first Electronic Patient Record System.&nbsp; Still in the last few years library videoconferencing equipment funded by Health Education England supported a business case to develop a remote consultation system in care homes so patients didn’t need to be admitted to hospital un-necessarily.&nbsp; We supported users into transition to Office 365 Teams, prior to the pandemic hitting and had the equipment to support corporate move off-site and enable the board to operate when the pandemic hit.&nbsp; We are beginning work with mixed reality and I have worked with IT, Microsoft and a student from UCL to develop a machine learning chat bot.</p>

          <p>The constant in the journey has been change.&nbsp; It is really hard to imagine going backwards in time, though I still have fond memories of toasting marshmallows on the bonfire of the old cards! The changes in technology have improved the services we deliver, supported our users and impacted on patient care.&nbsp; What is changing is the speed of change.</p>

          <p>Not everything I have engaged with has been a success, but I have learned.&nbsp; Working on the chat bot made me realise that very old-fashioned library skills of taxonomy, metadata and ontologies are become more relevant in the modern world to make information discoverable.&nbsp; Natural Language Processing isn’t enough.&nbsp; It also made me realise that technology requires expansion of staff and not the replacement.&nbsp; We never rolled-out the chat-bot.&nbsp; It is complete, but still sitting there due to lack of skills within the organisations and also lack of time to properly test.&nbsp; It’s taught me about skill gaps in the organisation (including my own), it has given me confidence to further explore and strengthen relations with informatic teams and just engaging with the working and discussing with others has helped raised the library profile.</p>

          <p>In a land of no experience having some knowledge of the topic is useful.&nbsp; We are known for being able to think across the organisation and have an ability to build relations.&nbsp; It is always best to share this journey alongside others both within and out-with your team.</p>

          <p>Something the organisation gets right is ‘permission to fail’.&nbsp; In the absence of research when approaching something new, this is vital.&nbsp; If you think about the speed of change and our changing knowledge as the pandemic unfolded, this always had to be the case.&nbsp; Sometimes it is better to do something, rather than nothing.&nbsp; Without out this, it is difficult to bring about change and make services fit for the future.</p>

          <p>When working on a new project get good project governance in place within your organisational structures.&nbsp; Try not to make it just an internal library thing. Whenever we submit a business case it is important we identify the risks, have plans to mitigate them if possible, but also have good governance and assurances on projects to know what to pull, amend or take forward as business as usual.&nbsp; It means you can tap the expertise of others and get support from senior leaders. The learning from this will continue to inform future work not just for your service but also for those around you.</p>

          <p>Be open.&nbsp; We all like to share the good stuff.&nbsp; It is difficult when things go wrong, especially if it is something you have invested a lot of time and effort into.&nbsp; I would love to see a library award for work we tried and failed, or even a regular column.&nbsp; That sort of learning can save people an awful lot of work.&nbsp; If you follow models like Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA cycle), you will also realise that a project may need to be tweaked several times or change course completely to be implemented.</p>

          <p>A strange thing about human nature is nobody likes an easy story.&nbsp; If relating a development, people always like to hear barriers, challenges.&nbsp; We love schadenfreude!&nbsp; It also makes the tale more relatable to others who think they can’t adopt something in their organisation when they realise the problems are the same.&nbsp; It also acts as a reminder of personal resilience, which is never a bad thing.</p>

          <p>Something the organisation gets right is ‘permission to fail’.&nbsp; In the absence of research when approaching something new, this is vital.&nbsp; If you think about the speed of change and our changing knowledge as the pandemic unfolded, this always had to be the case.&nbsp; Sometimes it is better to do something, rather than nothing.&nbsp; Without out this, it is difficult to bring about change and make services fit for the future.</p>

          <p>When working on a new project get good project governance in place within your organisational structures.&nbsp; Try not to make it just an internal library thing. Whenever we submit a business case it is important we identify the risks, have plans to mitigate them if possible, but also have good governance and assurances on projects to know what to pull, amend or take forward as business as usual.&nbsp; It means you can tap the expertise of others and get support from senior leaders. The learning from this will continue to inform future work not just for your service but also for those around you.</p>

          <p>Be open.&nbsp; We all like to share the good stuff.&nbsp; It is difficult when things go wrong, especially if it is something you have invested a lot of time and effort into.&nbsp; I would love to see a library award for work we tried and failed, or even a regular column.&nbsp; That sort of learning can save people an awful lot of work.&nbsp; If you follow models like Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA cycle), you will also realise that a project may need to be tweaked several times or change course completely to be implemented.</p>

          <p>A strange thing about human nature is nobody likes an easy story.&nbsp; If relating a development, people always like to hear barriers, challenges.&nbsp; We love schadenfreude!&nbsp; It also makes the tale more relatable to others who think they can’t adopt something in their organisation when they realise the problems are the same.&nbsp; It also acts as a reminder of personal resilience, which is never a bad thing.</p>

          <p>In 2021 I attended the CILIP conference Design It, Build it: Information Professionals at the heart of Digital Transformation.&nbsp; What struck me was the common theme of the conference was as the library as the human bridge between technology and our user.&nbsp; It is something we have always done.&nbsp; How many people ask for help accessing email, or wonder if their problem with IT is technical or human error?&nbsp; We support the people who struggle with technology and flag up the inequalities of access.</p>

          <p>In every presentation at the conference people were at the heart of digital transformation, not the technology itself.</p>

          <p>Kal Dhanda is rolling out the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="file:///C:/Users/ssmith11/OneDrive%2520-%2520Mid%2520Cheshire%2520Hospitals%2520NHS%2520Foundation%2520Trust/Desktop/Digital%2520Champions%2520Programme%2520Toolkit%2520-%2520Apr%25202021.pdf">NHS Digital Champions</a> Programme across Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust to support people struggling with technology and working in partnership with others to extend the support network to ensure digital inclusion.</p>

          <p>It was interesting to see Ciaran Talbot’s approach at the University of Manchester to put the library at the heart of digital transformation.&nbsp; They decided the best way to learn a topic is teach it and in doing so could demystify the topic not just for them, but others across the organisation.&nbsp; They ran a workshop for library staff, inviting IT, library users &amp; Head of Information Governance to discuss chat bots.&nbsp; They did the research, knew it was happening in other institutions and they already used <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://buzz.springshare.com/producthighlights/libanswers-platform/libchat">LibChat</a> as a virtual enquiry service.&nbsp; A key driver was they wanted to lead the way and not have the change forced on them. They looked at all aspects of the technology including organisational risk, branding, technology available and the impact to different audiences.&nbsp; They story- boarded the session as a summary at the end of the morning and blueprints in what they could do.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Once a week, they run a genius hour where staff can research something that interests them and would benefit the service.&nbsp; Robotic Process Automation was something explored.&nbsp; With a philosophy of start small they tested on the laborious process of bibliometric analysis of research outputs using <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a>, which freed staff time to develop more information to focus efforts on more skill appropriate work using Power BI.&nbsp; They understood it worked in this scenario, but now in the process of identifying future projects realise that it isn’t sustainable across the board or relevant to all processes.&nbsp; It works best with click heavy processes.</p>

          <p>Kirsty Lingstadt from the University of Edinburgh had an innovative approach where they created <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/">maker’s space</a> for technology.&nbsp; They started out with a 3D printer and a philosophy of teaching design and agile thinking.&nbsp; The Library is not just about knowledge, but the skills to use the knowledge.&nbsp; They ran introductory workshops and made the equipment available for anyone to use.&nbsp; The service has now expanded using only commercially available technology.&nbsp; While often people start of playing with the equipment, which proves the best way to learn, serious innovation then begins.&nbsp; Some students started spin off companies based on their experiments.&nbsp; They projects turned very collaborative across a number of disciplines and many outputs have now been fed back into teaching and improving the service.</p>

          <p>The innovation didn’t stop there.&nbsp; They have been working hard to data mine the textual content of their holdings, turning content of books and journals into data sets to better support their researchers.&nbsp; I also loved the concept of the generous interface.&nbsp; It offers a discovery layer which isn’t just about the library catalogue, but one where the information is pre-interpreted. e.g. geographical layer showing a world map blobs representing the home location of the collection content, subject matter or date.&nbsp; This is a technology driven by the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector where AI is improving access to diverse collections.</p>

          <p>Similar innovations are coming out of Lancaster University Library as Andrew Baxter described his strategic journey to deliver a library fit for purpose in current times.&nbsp; The motto they have co-produced is “We connect, we innovate, we include” which again is an echo of the important role libraries play in being the human bridge to technology.&nbsp; They are using Alexa to answer queries alongside LibChat.&nbsp; One of the more interesting projects has been around data cleansing publication lists which has been hugely successful in boosting the Universities research ratings.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A key trend highlight is no differentiation between physical and digital collections.&nbsp; The two should be seamlessly blended so users can access physical content at home and digital content should be made more visible in amongst the print collection.&nbsp; They are working to make e-books ‘real’ and exploring juke box or vending machine style options.&nbsp; University of new South Wales have got a fantastic example of how a dashboard can promote library usage in their <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="http://exhibitions.library.unsw.edu.au/unstacked">Unstacked project</a>.</p>

          <p>Another blending philosophy they have is of outside -in.&nbsp; In the recent refurbishment 3 new vertical garden walls have been installed in the library and work is under way to determine how the library can move outdoors over the summer period.</p>

          <p>Janet Peden from Ulster University also echoed the need to re-purpose the library space to look beyond the collection.&nbsp; She reminded us the greatest asset is the library staff – they are the human bridge and need to be brought along you.&nbsp; The work she has been doing resonates with shifts we have seen over Covid.&nbsp; The demand for more digital collaborative space has increased. Users are becoming the main user of library space and not the collections.&nbsp; Furniture is flexible and interacts with technology.&nbsp; The library is evolving into an active learning digital space.</p>

          <p>With this evolution new library job roles are developing, so supporting the training of staff to use and teach the technology is vital.&nbsp; Future jobs will be about helping upskill staff and bridging the technology gap.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>It is something we have always done with the advent of computers, MAC records and digitisation of records. As Dr Owain Rhys Roberts from the National Library of Wales says: It is about navigating change and evolving.&nbsp; Progress is long-term, we need to experiment and fail, the change will be incremental.&nbsp; It is how we engage, learn across the sectors and how we partner that will determine our success.</p>

          <p>It is important we don’t get blindsided by technology; a digital strategy should be cultural and not a technical strategy. People are at its heart and we are here to make the difference to lives, not just for the sake of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In delivering this, it will not be possible to be completely neutral. We need to be at the centre delivering change.&nbsp; It is about a blending of the worlds – don’t split the digital and physical – they are one.&nbsp; What is true in digital is true in physical.&nbsp; Maintain skills to connect people with information.&nbsp; Adopt the mantra “Keep calm and do something” when things feel challenging.</p>

          <p>Kirsty Lingstadt from the University of Edinburgh had an innovative approach where they created <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/">maker’s space</a> for technology.&nbsp; They started out with a 3D printer and a philosophy of teaching design and agile thinking.&nbsp; The Library is not just about knowledge, but the skills to use the knowledge.&nbsp; They ran introductory workshops and made the equipment available for anyone to use.&nbsp; The service has now expanded using only commercially available technology.&nbsp; While often people start of playing with the equipment, which proves the best way to learn, serious innovation then begins.&nbsp; Some students started spin off companies based on their experiments.&nbsp; They projects turned very collaborative across a number of disciplines and many outputs have now been fed back into teaching and improving the service.</p>

          <p>The innovation didn’t stop there.&nbsp; They have been working hard to data mine the textual content of their holdings, turning content of books and journals into data sets to better support their researchers.&nbsp; I also loved the concept of the generous interface.&nbsp; It offers a discovery layer which isn’t just about the library catalogue, but one where the information is pre-interpreted. e.g. geographical layer showing a world map blobs representing the home location of the collection content, subject matter or date.&nbsp; This is a technology driven by the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) sector where AI is improving access to diverse collections.</p>

          <p>Similar innovations are coming out of Lancaster University Library as Andrew Baxter described his strategic journey to deliver a library fit for purpose in current times.&nbsp; The motto they have co-produced is “We connect, we innovate, we include” which again is an echo of the important role libraries play in being the human bridge to technology.&nbsp; They are using Alexa to answer queries alongside LibChat.&nbsp; One of the more interesting projects has been around data cleansing publication lists which has been hugely successful in boosting the Universities research ratings.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A key trend highlight is no differentiation between physical and digital collections.&nbsp; The two should be seamlessly blended so users can access physical content at home and digital content should be made more visible in amongst the print collection.&nbsp; They are working to make e-books ‘real’ and exploring juke box or vending machine style options.&nbsp; University of new South Wales have got a fantastic example of how a dashboard can promote library usage in their <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="http://exhibitions.library.unsw.edu.au/unstacked">Unstacked project</a>.</p>

          <p>Another blending philosophy they have is of outside -in.&nbsp; In the recent refurbishment 3 new vertical garden walls have been installed in the library and work is under way to determine how the library can move outdoors over the summer period.</p>

          <p>Janet Peden from Ulster University also echoed the need to re-purpose the library space to look beyond the collection.&nbsp; She reminded us the greatest asset is the library staff – they are the human bridge and need to be brought along you.&nbsp; The work she has been doing resonates with shifts we have seen over Covid.&nbsp; The demand for more digital collaborative space has increased. Users are becoming the main user of library space and not the collections.&nbsp; Furniture is flexible and interacts with technology.&nbsp; The library is evolving into an active learning digital space.</p>

          <p>With this evolution new library job roles are developing, so supporting the training of staff to use and teach the technology is vital.&nbsp; Future jobs will be about helping upskill staff and bridging the technology gap.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>It is something we have always done with the advent of computers, MAC records and digitisation of records. As Dr Owain Rhys Roberts from the National Library of Wales says: It is about navigating change and evolving.&nbsp; Progress is long-term, we need to experiment and fail, the change will be incremental.&nbsp; It is how we engage, learn across the sectors and how we partner that will determine our success.</p>

          <p>It is important we don’t get blindsided by technology; a digital strategy should be cultural and not a technical strategy. People are at its heart and we are here to make the difference to lives, not just for the sake of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In delivering this, it will not be possible to be completely neutral. We need to be at the centre delivering change.&nbsp; It is about a blending of the worlds – don’t split the digital and physical – they are one.&nbsp; What is true in digital is true in physical.&nbsp; Maintain skills to connect people with information.&nbsp; Adopt the mantra “Keep calm and do something” when things feel challenging.</p>

          <p>Everyone that has tried to develop a service is aware of the constant query of “How are you going to fund this?”.&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital transformation is costly.&nbsp; So how do you make your case? These ideas and reflections are based on some of the presentations from the CILIP Conference: Design It, Build it: Information Professionals at the heart of Digital Transformation</p>

          <p>Value must be at the centre of any digital transformation work, so work needs to being in understanding ‘why do it’ and ‘what difference will it make’?&nbsp; Luckily some people have already started on this work in terms of national drivers.&nbsp; Research Libraries UK have an excellent <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.rluk.ac.uk/digital-shift-manifesto/">manifesto for digital transformation</a> which plots the future direction of libraries and we have the slightly more oblique Knowledge for Healthcare, which challenges to ensure with have the right services and ensure our staff are appropriately trained.&nbsp; This is backed up by other reports such as the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/">Topol Review</a> and <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/general/custom.asp?page=researchreport">The impact of AI, machine learning, automation and robotics on the information profession</a>, beyond libraries we also have the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/areas-of-work/digital-transformation/">NHS Long Term Plan</a> which aims to cut red tape and empower patients and it sits neatly alongside the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england">NHS Constitution</a> and the drive to form <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/what-is-integrated-care/">Integrated Care Systems</a>.</p>

          <p>You might do an evidence search to justify your case or search for good practice and work already going on to strengthen your decision-making process. Whilst these are all powerful guiding factors at a strategic level and ensures that decisions should be founded on evidence, inevitably any transformation work you wish to do is one that is designed to solve a local need.</p>

          <p>To deliver locally it is never something the library should do alone.&nbsp; The most effective projects are ones which are multidisciplinary.&nbsp; Sometimes we see teams like IT, Information Governance and Procurement as processes to go through rather than people to work alongside and share the journey.&nbsp; There may be variations locally, I know I would include discussions with our Organisational Development Team and Quality Improvement Faculty as a sounding board as often a change isn’t just about the technology, it is about the people.&nbsp; Their specialist knowledge and expertise can reduce your workload and see the argument from different sides and prepare you more for any questions raised.&nbsp; You also need to ensure all the correct stakeholders are on board, so think about not just who can support you, but anyone who will be using the technology or impacted by it.&nbsp; It may be worth gathering people to discuss your ideas in a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/before-action-review">before action review</a>. A co-produced project is well thought out, meets the needs of the organisation and solves an existing challenge.&nbsp; It also involves networking and building strong relations with the teams you will work closely with to develop future projects.&nbsp; They will also support you in knowing which is the most appropriate governance route the project needs to take to be accountable in the organisation.</p>

          <p>Once you have a project group, you will also need to ensure you can get senior management buy-in and fully understand the needs of the organisation and the value of your project to it.&nbsp; Doing this work increases accountability reporting and ensures that it becomes embedded in organisational expectation.&nbsp; How does your project align with organisational strategy and what are the views of both those delivering the project and the potential users impacted by the outcome.&nbsp; This is the stage that you may also be able to identify other potential influencers who may support the project.&nbsp; You can do surveys, focus groups, run workshops or get creative with simulation scenarios or engagement with poetry.&nbsp; You can make some of the suggestions public and get people to vote for what resonates with them, to get a feeling for where the organisational priorities lie.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A value proposition is all about <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.b2binternational.com/research/methods/faq/what-is-the-value-proposition-canvas/">the pains and gains</a> (risks and benefits) to help understand the drivers and also to mitigate risks identified.&nbsp; Remember to include the risk of not doing the work.</p>

          <p>With your own team, discuss how the project will be delivered you may need to run a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2016/02/02/start-stop-continue-tutorial/?sh=6d1c7a812798">Start, Stop or Continue</a> exercise to the workload to understand if it is possible to deliver or whether a new role is required or support can be found from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Another methodology advocated by Ken Chad is <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.kenchadconsulting.com/how-we-can-help/innovation/">Jobs To Be Done</a> (#JTBD).&nbsp; This accounts for the times when what the user asks for is difficult to translate into a service or may be a slightly different request than first perceived.&nbsp; The focus here on analysing the user needs.&nbsp; It looks at what problems need to be solved, who needs to solve them and the ‘circumstance’ of the problem i.e. easier access to resources might be accesses to resources using their mobiles on a train or a podcast in the car on a daily commute.</p>

          <p>Next thing you need to do is understand the market.&nbsp; What products are out there?&nbsp; This should involve not just an internet search, but actually getting in contact with product suppliers for a discussion.&nbsp; They know the market and can advise, perhaps a demonstration or a trial can be set up to ensure that the product will satisfy the needs of the user.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>At this point it may also be worth arranging a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/peer-assist">peer assist</a> to get helpful views and insights from colleagues who have undergone similar work.&nbsp; Remember when you undertake the work remain neutral.&nbsp; Just because you have used a product before doesn’t mean it should be given preferential treatment as products can and do evolve.&nbsp; In some cases we have the NHS procurement frameworks which can by-pass some of the leg work.&nbsp; If not you might consider using tools like <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://rfp360.com/rfi-rfp-rfq/">RFI, RFQ &amp; RFP </a>to help you better work alongside vendors.</p>

          <p>Part of this final piece of work may also being taking advice around the finances. Find out how others have succeeded in the past from vendors, people who have gone before or by speaking to your Finance Department.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look out for bursaries and grants from NHS Digital, Quality Improvement Forums e.g. AQuA, NHS England &amp; Improvement and Health Education England.&nbsp; You may consider undertaking a Topol Fellowship to support financing.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Another thing to consider are what are your indicators of success.&nbsp; Find out what has worked well in other organisations. If after an initial trial of the technology, make sure it is reviewed against the actual impact and value delivered.&nbsp; This is what helps to build the case to move it from trial to roll out and business as usual.&nbsp; Like any improvement, once new elements are introduced or time has passed, you need to ensure the appropriate review of the service for further improvements or to see if it still remains fit for purpose.</p>

          <p>Now you have gathered the information you need to work with you project team to make the business case.&nbsp; How this is done may vary from organisation.&nbsp; A helpful format to use is <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/qsir-sbar-communication-tool.pdf">Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation</a> (SBAR) Tool.</p>

          <p>When doing this work, remember what skills librarians can bring to the process.&nbsp; Not only can we make decisions evidence-based, but we can also look beyond the sector and make connections from other information sources.&nbsp; When looking at technology there is much to learn from outside of both libraries and healthcare.&nbsp; We bring a curious mindset which aids us in our searches and conversations.&nbsp; We also have several soft skills around relationship building with our service users, understanding the different user needs and agendas.&nbsp; If you know someone’s interests, you can target the case.&nbsp; We also know how to summarise technical concepts into something people can understand.&nbsp; Once we research something, we can make the complex more understandable and accessible.</p>

          <p>Everyone that has tried to develop a service is aware of the constant query of “How are you going to fund this?”.&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital transformation is costly.&nbsp; So how do you make your case? These ideas and reflections are based on some of the presentations from the CILIP Conference: Design It, Build it: Information Professionals at the heart of Digital Transformation</p>

          <p>Value must be at the centre of any digital transformation work, so work needs to being in understanding ‘why do it’ and ‘what difference will it make’?&nbsp; Luckily some people have already started on this work in terms of national drivers.&nbsp; Research Libraries UK have an excellent <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.rluk.ac.uk/digital-shift-manifesto/">manifesto for digital transformation</a> which plots the future direction of libraries and we have the slightly more oblique Knowledge for Healthcare, which challenges to ensure with have the right services and ensure our staff are appropriately trained.&nbsp; This is backed up by other reports such as the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/">Topol Review</a> and <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/general/custom.asp?page=researchreport">The impact of AI, machine learning, automation and robotics on the information profession</a>, beyond libraries we also have the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/areas-of-work/digital-transformation/">NHS Long Term Plan</a> which aims to cut red tape and empower patients and it sits neatly alongside the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england/the-nhs-constitution-for-england">NHS Constitution</a> and the drive to form <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/integratedcare/what-is-integrated-care/">Integrated Care Systems</a>.</p>

          <p>You might do an evidence search to justify your case or search for good practice and work already going on to strengthen your decision-making process. Whilst these are all powerful guiding factors at a strategic level and ensures that decisions should be founded on evidence, inevitably any transformation work you wish to do is one that is designed to solve a local need.</p>

          <p>To deliver locally it is never something the library should do alone.&nbsp; The most effective projects are ones which are multidisciplinary.&nbsp; Sometimes we see teams like IT, Information Governance and Procurement as processes to go through rather than people to work alongside and share the journey.&nbsp; There may be variations locally, I know I would include discussions with our Organisational Development Team and Quality Improvement Faculty as a sounding board as often a change isn’t just about the technology, it is about the people.&nbsp; Their specialist knowledge and expertise can reduce your workload and see the argument from different sides and prepare you more for any questions raised.&nbsp; You also need to ensure all the correct stakeholders are on board, so think about not just who can support you, but anyone who will be using the technology or impacted by it.&nbsp; It may be worth gathering people to discuss your ideas in a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/before-action-review">before action review</a>. A co-produced project is well thought out, meets the needs of the organisation and solves an existing challenge.&nbsp; It also involves networking and building strong relations with the teams you will work closely with to develop future projects.&nbsp; They will also support you in knowing which is the most appropriate governance route the project needs to take to be accountable in the organisation.</p>

          <p>Once you have a project group, you will also need to ensure you can get senior management buy-in and fully understand the needs of the organisation and the value of your project to it.&nbsp; Doing this work increases accountability reporting and ensures that it becomes embedded in organisational expectation.&nbsp; How does your project align with organisational strategy and what are the views of both those delivering the project and the potential users impacted by the outcome.&nbsp; This is the stage that you may also be able to identify other potential influencers who may support the project.&nbsp; You can do surveys, focus groups, run workshops or get creative with simulation scenarios or engagement with poetry.&nbsp; You can make some of the suggestions public and get people to vote for what resonates with them, to get a feeling for where the organisational priorities lie.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A value proposition is all about <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.b2binternational.com/research/methods/faq/what-is-the-value-proposition-canvas/">the pains and gains</a> (risks and benefits) to help understand the drivers and also to mitigate risks identified.&nbsp; Remember to include the risk of not doing the work.</p>

          <p>With your own team, discuss how the project will be delivered you may need to run a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/groupthink/2016/02/02/start-stop-continue-tutorial/?sh=6d1c7a812798">Start, Stop or Continue</a> exercise to the workload to understand if it is possible to deliver or whether a new role is required or support can be found from elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Another methodology advocated by Ken Chad is <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.kenchadconsulting.com/how-we-can-help/innovation/">Jobs To Be Done</a> (#JTBD).&nbsp; This accounts for the times when what the user asks for is difficult to translate into a service or may be a slightly different request than first perceived.&nbsp; The focus here on analysing the user needs.&nbsp; It looks at what problems need to be solved, who needs to solve them and the ‘circumstance’ of the problem i.e. easier access to resources might be accesses to resources using their mobiles on a train or a podcast in the car on a daily commute.</p>

          <p>Next thing you need to do is understand the market.&nbsp; What products are out there?&nbsp; This should involve not just an internet search, but actually getting in contact with product suppliers for a discussion.&nbsp; They know the market and can advise, perhaps a demonstration or a trial can be set up to ensure that the product will satisfy the needs of the user.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>At this point it may also be worth arranging a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/peer-assist">peer assist</a> to get helpful views and insights from colleagues who have undergone similar work.&nbsp; Remember when you undertake the work remain neutral.&nbsp; Just because you have used a product before doesn’t mean it should be given preferential treatment as products can and do evolve.&nbsp; In some cases we have the NHS procurement frameworks which can by-pass some of the leg work.&nbsp; If not you might consider using tools like <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://rfp360.com/rfi-rfp-rfq/">RFI, RFQ &amp; RFP </a>to help you better work alongside vendors.</p>

          <p>Part of this final piece of work may also being taking advice around the finances. Find out how others have succeeded in the past from vendors, people who have gone before or by speaking to your Finance Department.&nbsp; &nbsp;Look out for bursaries and grants from NHS Digital, Quality Improvement Forums e.g. AQuA, NHS England &amp; Improvement and Health Education England.&nbsp; You may consider undertaking a Topol Fellowship to support financing.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Another thing to consider are what are your indicators of success.&nbsp; Find out what has worked well in other organisations. If after an initial trial of the technology, make sure it is reviewed against the actual impact and value delivered.&nbsp; This is what helps to build the case to move it from trial to roll out and business as usual.&nbsp; Like any improvement, once new elements are introduced or time has passed, you need to ensure the appropriate review of the service for further improvements or to see if it still remains fit for purpose.</p>

          <p>Now you have gathered the information you need to work with you project team to make the business case.&nbsp; How this is done may vary from organisation.&nbsp; A helpful format to use is <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/qsir-sbar-communication-tool.pdf">Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation</a> (SBAR) Tool.</p>

          <p>When doing this work, remember what skills librarians can bring to the process.&nbsp; Not only can we make decisions evidence-based, but we can also look beyond the sector and make connections from other information sources.&nbsp; When looking at technology there is much to learn from outside of both libraries and healthcare.&nbsp; We bring a curious mindset which aids us in our searches and conversations.&nbsp; We also have several soft skills around relationship building with our service users, understanding the different user needs and agendas.&nbsp; If you know someone’s interests, you can target the case.&nbsp; We also know how to summarise technical concepts into something people can understand.&nbsp; Once we research something, we can make the complex more understandable and accessible.</p>

          <p>“positioning&nbsp;NHS knowledge specialists to develop and implement strategies working with organisations to create strong learning cultures…&nbsp;leading&nbsp;to the breakdown of silos enabling evidence and knowledge to truly drive change across the NHS in England.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This challenge is picked-up in the&nbsp;refreshed&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare" target="_blank">Knowledge for Healthcare strategy of 2021</a>&nbsp;where the strategic intention for mobilising evidence and knowledge is stated that:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Healthcare organisations, services and systems effectively mobilise evidence, learning, knowledge and ‘know how’ to enable evidence-based policy and practice.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Specific outcomes are defined as:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Healthcare organisations, services and systems are effective in mobilising evidence and internally generated knowledge&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Healthcare staff Apply and use evidence, Build know how,&nbsp;Continue&nbsp;to learn and Drive innovation&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Healthcare knowledge and library staff manage and mobilise evidence and knowledge&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>So,&nbsp;what do we mean by mobilising evidence and knowledge?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>There are many terms that are used interchangeably to describe knowledge mobilisation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge management, knowledge sharing, shared learning, learning lessons, connecting people, sharing ‘know-how’, knowledge transfer, spread and&nbsp;adoption,&nbsp;knowledge translation and even evidence-based medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/k-is-for-knowledge-and-m-is-for-mobilisation.-why-bother-with-knowledge-mobilisation-in-healthcare" target="_blank">Blog Post, K is for Knowledge and M is for Mobilisation</a>&nbsp;aimed to develop a working definition based on the easy read version of the Knowledge for Healthcare Strategy:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>“Getting the right information from different places and sharing it” and this “right information” can be from reports, research,&nbsp;the internet and from the&nbsp;things people know but haven’t written down.&nbsp; People can then use this knowledge to help inform their decisions and actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-from-data" target="_blank">been encouraged by our colleague Susan Smith</a>&nbsp;in her blog post,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-from-data" target="_blank">Knowledge as Data</a>, to consider broadening this definition further to include how we can apply our skills to mobilising data.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The image adapted from the Knowledge Management Toolkit by A.&nbsp;Lambe&nbsp;sums this up neatly:&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Launching a digital Knowledge Mobilisation Self-Assessment Tool&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>A highlight of 2021 was the launch of the digital&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/self-assessment-tool" target="_blank">Knowledge Mobilisation Self-&nbsp;Assessment Tool</a>&nbsp;which improves&nbsp;the experience&nbsp;of&nbsp;healthcare staff&nbsp;working&nbsp;with knowledge specialists to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;how well they are using evidence and knowledge and where there are opportunities to develop.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Use of the tool will enable teams to continually improve upon how they&nbsp;maximise the use of evidence and organisational knowledge to aid&nbsp;informed&nbsp;decision&nbsp;making,&nbsp;which in turn will&nbsp;make a tangible&nbsp;difference&nbsp;to healthcare outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Action plans resulting from analysis of the self-assessment results may lead to more&nbsp;people&nbsp;undertaking literature search skills development,&nbsp;considering how they evaluate the evidence they are using&nbsp;or adopting various tools to share and use learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;To help with&nbsp;this,&nbsp;work is underway to refresh the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/literature-searching/" target="_blank">How to Search the Literature e-learning</a>,&nbsp;e-learning about critical appraisal techniques has been commissioned&nbsp;and there are plans for 2022 to refresh and expand the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/" target="_blank">NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Plans are underway to refresh the successful&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.nhs.uk/our-work/making-a-positive-impact/" target="_blank">#AMillionDecisions initiative</a>&nbsp;in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;To update the endorsements and examples of impact that have raised the profile of our work&nbsp;and to place more of an emphasis upon raising the profile of your local services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Whilst in this global pandemic the&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;of our profession has been recognised as&nbsp;making&nbsp;a valuable contribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensuring the right evidence and knowledge are mobilised at the right time and in the right&nbsp;place,&nbsp;making&nbsp;this straightforward for people to&nbsp;use and contributing to a learning culture&nbsp;is critical.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>This challenge is picked-up in the&nbsp;refreshed&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare" target="_blank">Knowledge for Healthcare strategy of 2021</a>&nbsp;where the strategic intention for mobilising evidence and knowledge is stated that:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Healthcare organisations, services and systems effectively mobilise evidence, learning, knowledge and ‘know how’ to enable evidence-based policy and practice.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Specific outcomes are defined as:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Healthcare organisations, services and systems are effective in mobilising evidence and internally generated knowledge&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Healthcare staff Apply and use evidence, Build know how,&nbsp;Continue&nbsp;to learn and Drive innovation&nbsp;</p>

           <p>Healthcare knowledge and library staff manage and mobilise evidence and knowledge&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>So,&nbsp;what do we mean by mobilising evidence and knowledge?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>There are many terms that are used interchangeably to describe knowledge mobilisation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge management, knowledge sharing, shared learning, learning lessons, connecting people, sharing ‘know-how’, knowledge transfer, spread and&nbsp;adoption,&nbsp;knowledge translation and even evidence-based medicine&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        and knowledge.  We have continued to raise our profile and were delighted
        that NHS library and knowledge professionals were recognised by Professor
        Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England.  December is a traditional
        time to reflect and also look forward to what is to come.  We would like to
        take this opportunity to summarise and recycle some previous thinking and
        give you a flavour of some of the work underway.

          <p>As health care organisations transition to health care systems delivering services across a geographical footprint, there is a wealth of opportunities for library and knowledge services to support and enhance evidence-based care.</p>

          <p>A 2017 study, despite being published a while back, demonstrates the enormity of the challenge facing the NHS of ensuring that all patients receive high quality, evidence based care. It’s a useful study for us as library and knowledge professionals to be aware of, highlighting as it does the level of variation and reasons why our expertise in mobilising knowledge is such an important contribution to the delivery of high quality health care.</p>

          <p><a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132759/1/journal.pone.0177949.pdf">Willis et al (2017)</a> explored the variations in achievement of evidence-based, high-impact quality indicators in general practice. Seven high impact quality indicators were developed for primary care and the variation in achieving these indicators was measured across GP practices in West Yorkshire. Four indicators focused on processes of care (e.g. prescribing or testing) and three on clinical outcomes (blood pressure, cholesterol and glycaemic control).</p>

          <p><a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132759/1/journal.pone.0177949.pdf">Willis et al (2017)</a></p>

          <p>Two key findings in the study are of particular interest.</p>

          <h2><strong>1) The performance of GP practices in achieving quality indicators</strong></h2>

          <p>Achievement of the seven evidence based quality indicators across participating GP practices was as follows:</p>

          <ol>
           <li>Diabetes processes of care: 59.1%</li>
           <li>Risky prescribing: 8.7% (a low percentage indicates safer, more desirable practice)</li>
           <li>Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and risk of stroke: 63.0%</li>
           <li>Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction: 54.6%</li>
           <li>Diabetes control: 43.2%</li>
           <li>Blood pressure control in hypertension: 71.7%</li>
           <li>Blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: 74.2%</li>
          </ol>

          <p>These differences against quality indicators are perhaps expected, and demonstrate that some GP practices are struggling to achieve evidence-based practice in key areas of patient care.</p>

          <h2><strong>2) A marked variation in performance between practices</strong></h2>

          <p>The second key finding of interest to us is that the likelihood of receiving evidence-based treatment varied substantially as a consequence of the practice attended. Even accounting for contributing factors (such as the age profile of patients), the study found considerable variation in achievement of the seven quality indicators between GP practices.</p>

          <p>What can we draw from this? It highlights that there are likely to be several contributing factors at play that prevent evidence-based recommendations from being implemented. According to the authors, this is likely to be due to differences in culture and behaviours:</p>

          <p>“The odds of patients receiving recommended care or achieving recommended treatment targets varied between two- and over ten-fold by indicator according to the practice attended. These marked variations were partly explained by a range of routinely available practice and patient variables; it is likely that much variation is related to clinical and organisational behaviours.” (p11)</p>

          <p>Library and Knowledge Services can play an active part in enhancing clinical and organisational information behaviours in health care systems. This may be through ensuring easy and timely access to the evidence base, equipping health care staff with skills in information searching and critical thinking, or embedding optimal knowledge management behaviours to encourage a learning culture. Accordingly, our contribution to organisational culture and behaviours can support health care systems to reduce unwarranted variation and improve the quality of care.</p>

          <p>As knowledge specialists working in health, we are keenly aware that there is a gap between evidence and everyday practice, but perhaps most people attending an appointment at their local practice isn’t?</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the findings of this study presents some interesting challenges to us as a profession. Firstly, as our perspective shifts towards supporting the knowledge requirements of health care systems, how can we work more effectively together to help the NHS tackle unwarranted variation in treatment? Secondly, knowledge management is more than simply disseminating evidence across our networks. How can we use our skills to influence behaviour, and how far should our role extend into embedding evidence into practice? Finally, library and Knowledge Services have a role in ensuring citizens are supported to self-manage their conditions effectively and are empowered them with knowledge. How can we do that most effectively?</p>

          <p>Please share your thoughts on the issues discussed here, and if you have any interesting studies on this topic please share them too!</p>

          <p>As health care organisations transition to health care systems delivering services across a geographical footprint, there is a wealth of opportunities for library and knowledge services to support and enhance evidence-based care.</p>

          <p>A 2017 study, despite being published a while back, demonstrates the enormity of the challenge facing the NHS of ensuring that all patients receive high quality, evidence based care. It’s a useful study for us as library and knowledge professionals to be aware of, highlighting as it does the level of variation and reasons why our expertise in mobilising knowledge is such an important contribution to the delivery of high quality health care.</p>

          <p><a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132759/1/journal.pone.0177949.pdf">Willis et al (2017)</a> explored the variations in achievement of evidence-based, high-impact quality indicators in general practice. Seven high impact quality indicators were developed for primary care and the variation in achieving these indicators was measured across GP practices in West Yorkshire. Four indicators focused on processes of care (e.g. prescribing or testing) and three on clinical outcomes (blood pressure, cholesterol and glycaemic control).</p>

          <p><a href="http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/132759/1/journal.pone.0177949.pdf">Willis et al (2017)</a></p>

          <p>Two key findings in the study are of particular interest.</p>

          <h2><strong>1) The performance of GP practices in achieving quality indicators</strong></h2>

          <p>Achievement of the seven evidence based quality indicators across participating GP practices was as follows:</p>

          <ol>
           <li>Diabetes processes of care: 59.1%</li>
           <li>Risky prescribing: 8.7% (a low percentage indicates safer, more desirable practice)</li>
           <li>Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and risk of stroke: 63.0%</li>
           <li>Secondary prevention of myocardial infarction: 54.6%</li>
           <li>Diabetes control: 43.2%</li>
           <li>Blood pressure control in hypertension: 71.7%</li>
           <li>Blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: 74.2%</li>
          </ol>

          <p>These differences against quality indicators are perhaps expected, and demonstrate that some GP practices are struggling to achieve evidence-based practice in key areas of patient care.</p>

          <h2><strong>2) A marked variation in performance between practices</strong></h2>

          <p>The second key finding of interest to us is that the likelihood of receiving evidence-based treatment varied substantially as a consequence of the practice attended. Even accounting for contributing factors (such as the age profile of patients), the study found considerable variation in achievement of the seven quality indicators between GP practices.</p>

          <p>What can we draw from this? It highlights that there are likely to be several contributing factors at play that prevent evidence-based recommendations from being implemented. According to the authors, this is likely to be due to differences in culture and behaviours:</p>

          <p>“The odds of patients receiving recommended care or achieving recommended treatment targets varied between two- and over ten-fold by indicator according to the practice attended. These marked variations were partly explained by a range of routinely available practice and patient variables; it is likely that much variation is related to clinical and organisational behaviours.” (p11)</p>

          <p>Library and Knowledge Services can play an active part in enhancing clinical and organisational information behaviours in health care systems. This may be through ensuring easy and timely access to the evidence base, equipping health care staff with skills in information searching and critical thinking, or embedding optimal knowledge management behaviours to encourage a learning culture. Accordingly, our contribution to organisational culture and behaviours can support health care systems to reduce unwarranted variation and improve the quality of care.</p>

          <p>As knowledge specialists working in health, we are keenly aware that there is a gap between evidence and everyday practice, but perhaps most people attending an appointment at their local practice isn’t?</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the findings of this study presents some interesting challenges to us as a profession. Firstly, as our perspective shifts towards supporting the knowledge requirements of health care systems, how can we work more effectively together to help the NHS tackle unwarranted variation in treatment? Secondly, knowledge management is more than simply disseminating evidence across our networks. How can we use our skills to influence behaviour, and how far should our role extend into embedding evidence into practice? Finally, library and Knowledge Services have a role in ensuring citizens are supported to self-manage their conditions effectively and are empowered them with knowledge. How can we do that most effectively?</p>

          <p>Please share your thoughts on the issues discussed here, and if you have any interesting studies on this topic please share them too!</p>

          <p>Caroline Green from Whittington Health tells us what she did to&nbsp;get the BMJ Best Practice desktop icon&nbsp;rolled out for GPs in North Central London.&nbsp;Her experience will be of interest to anyone trying to roll out either the BMJ Best Practice or NHS Knowledge and Library Hub desktop icon.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>“North Central London&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;five&nbsp;boroughs - Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Haringey and Islington&nbsp;-&nbsp;and their IT is a split estate.</p>

          <p>One side covers Camden and all the laptops being used throughout NCL, and the other side covers the desktop PCs in the other 4 boroughs and is outsourced to a company.</p>

          <p>I was surprised to receive an invoice for the work for the 4 boroughs partly because I was unsure who would be responsible for paying! After discussion with my&nbsp;manager,&nbsp;we decided it would come out of the HEE payment - it wasn't for very much thankfully.</p>

          <p>So be mindful of unforeseen costs! We are likely to experience the same when we ask for the desktop link to the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;Knowledge and Library Hub which is good to know in advance.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Because of this payment, there has&nbsp;been a delay in getting the work done because the company&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be approved by our procurements department. It has also been difficult to get hold of the relevant people over&nbsp;Christmas.</p>

          <p>The company won't do the work without a purchase order, which we can't get before the company has been approved. So be mindful of unforeseen delays!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The very helpful person I have been liaising with who works for NCL says the work will take very little time once everything has been approved. We are going to coordinate the installation with an official comms advertising it and use the opportunity to promote our new services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I hope it has been useful for someone to hear about our experience so far and fingers crossed for the roll out in the new year! I imagine we'll all have slightly different experiences getting this sorted, some smoother than others!”&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Caroline Green from Whittington Health tells us what she did to&nbsp;get the BMJ Best Practice desktop icon&nbsp;rolled out for GPs in North Central London.&nbsp;Her experience will be of interest to anyone trying to roll out either the BMJ Best Practice or NHS Knowledge and Library Hub desktop icon.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>“North Central London&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;five&nbsp;boroughs - Barnet, Camden, Enfield, Haringey and Islington&nbsp;-&nbsp;and their IT is a split estate.</p>

          <p>One side covers Camden and all the laptops being used throughout NCL, and the other side covers the desktop PCs in the other 4 boroughs and is outsourced to a company.</p>

          <p>I was surprised to receive an invoice for the work for the 4 boroughs partly because I was unsure who would be responsible for paying! After discussion with my&nbsp;manager,&nbsp;we decided it would come out of the HEE payment - it wasn't for very much thankfully.</p>

          <p>So be mindful of unforeseen costs! We are likely to experience the same when we ask for the desktop link to the&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;Knowledge and Library Hub which is good to know in advance.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Because of this payment, there has&nbsp;been a delay in getting the work done because the company&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be approved by our procurements department. It has also been difficult to get hold of the relevant people over&nbsp;Christmas.</p>

          <p>The company won't do the work without a purchase order, which we can't get before the company has been approved. So be mindful of unforeseen delays!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The very helpful person I have been liaising with who works for NCL says the work will take very little time once everything has been approved. We are going to coordinate the installation with an official comms advertising it and use the opportunity to promote our new services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>I hope it has been useful for someone to hear about our experience so far and fingers crossed for the roll out in the new year! I imagine we'll all have slightly different experiences getting this sorted, some smoother than others!”&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>What’s the current picture nationally and what do we want to achieve?</strong></h2>

          <p>There are 93 separate library management systems (LMSs) currently in use by NHS knowledge and library services in England. Some of these are regional or shared by a small number of services, but the majority are single-service systems, each with their own OPACs.</p>

          <p>The benefits of shared LMS include enabling access to a greater pool of resources, consistency and simplicity of end-user experience, time-savings and workflow streamlining opportunities for library teams, and cost-savings for the NHS.</p>

          <p>As with any type of sharing, economies and opportunities must be balanced against the need for collaborating partners to have influence and ownership, and there isn’t a formula for determining the optimal number of library services to include in a shared system.</p>

          <p>Regional collaboration has always been important to NHS library services.&nbsp; We think it makes sense to work towards about seven regional systems across the country, fully integrated with the national discovery layer to further reduce the number of multitude of search platforms. So that’s our aim for the next five years.</p>

          <p>To date there have been regional differences in the extent to which HEE or its predecessors have contributed to the cost of library management systems. So another goal is to achieve equity.</p>

          <p>The Knowledge for Healthcare Board has agreed that HEE should assume responsibility for the library service delivery infrastructure and move to fully funding the hosting and management of regional LMS going forward.</p>

          <p>A programme of work to achieve these goals began in 2020:</p>

          <h2><strong>South West, Thames Valley and Wessex</strong></h2>

          <p>The longest established region wide consortium comprising 27 library services, the SWIMS network, has implemented new LMS from Infor (now Axiell), replacing legacy software which had been used for many years.</p>

          <p>The SWIMS catalogue has been integrated into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub, so Hub users in this region can find the print books - and more easily discover the e-books - available to them.</p>

          <h2><strong>East of England and Kent, Surrey and Sussex</strong></h2>

          <p>Work is currently underway to implement replacement shared LMSs for 16 library services in the East of England, and 12 in KSS, following a procurement exercise which resulted in a contract award to PTFS Europe for their Koha system.&nbsp; This is due to go live in May 2022.</p>

          <h2><strong>London and the Midlands</strong></h2>

          <p>The work undertaken by one of the 2021 Senior Leadership Programme project groups and the enthusiasm of library service managers have combined to build commitment to expanding the existing South London Koha consortium to include other London libraries.</p>

          <p>Three services will have joined by the end of March, and two further expansion phases planned. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>A similar development is taking place in the Midlands, where a consortium of 10 library services in the Birmingham area have used a shared Koha system for some years.</p>

          <p>Following engagement with other services in the Midlands, a further 12 services will join during 2022 and 2023.</p>

          <p>HEE has used the Government’s G-Cloud Framework to directly procure Koha from PTFS Europe for both regions, and from April is fully funding the implementation costs as well as the ongoing hosting and management costs.</p>

          <h2><strong>North</strong></h2>

          <p>Last but definitely not least, the north, where the seven North East library services which have been using a shared system provided by OCLC are looking to be the next to have their shared catalogue integrated into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub.</p>

          <p>To date, most library services in the North West and in Yorkshire and Humber have continued to use existing local LMS &nbsp;– a wise move given the amount of system change which has taken place recently and impacted on library services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The introduction of a new library system is undoubtedly a significant change project) and the benefits of waiting to learn from others’ experience.</p>

          <p>As above, though, equity is one of our principles, and we don’t want any region to miss out, so we will continue conversations with northern service managers to progress regional LMS.</p>

          <h2><strong>Who’s making all this happen?</strong></h2>

          <p>In each region with an LMS implementation, extension or integration taking place, the managers of participating services are on steering groups with team members variously involved in project and module groups.&nbsp; We have also been fortunate to secure dedicated time from library staff who have stepped up as project managers and system managers and administrators.</p>

          <p>We have recently established a community of practice for everyone operating in these roles, for peer support, to share practice and experience, and to avoid duplication.</p>

          <p>One of the members of the group, Jenny Toller who is the SWIMS Lead in the South region, comments:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">"On-boarding a library into an existing LMS might seem like a technical exercise of moving records from one system to another, but there is so much more to it than that.&nbsp; One main learning point from recent experience is to get Information Governance and IT on board right from the very start of the project."</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">Emily Johnson, Project Manager for the Midlands notes:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">“The work in the Midlands has very much been a collaborative process. We have been working hard to develop shared Circulation and Cataloguing rules. This has brought challenges at times; the proposed Midlands LMS includes close to 50 different libraries, many with their own historical rules which have been debated and worked through. We have now managed to gain a consensus which we believe will work best for library users in the region.”</p>

          <p>The longest established region wide consortium comprising 27 library services, the SWIMS network, has implemented new LMS from Infor (now Axiell), replacing legacy software which had been used for many years.</p>

          <p>The SWIMS catalogue has been integrated into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub, so Hub users in this region can find the print books - and more easily discover the e-books - available to them.</p>

          <h2><strong>East of England and Kent, Surrey and Sussex</strong></h2>

          <p>Work is currently underway to implement replacement shared LMSs for 16 library services in the East of England, and 12 in KSS, following a procurement exercise which resulted in a contract award to PTFS Europe for their Koha system.&nbsp; This is due to go live in May 2022.</p>

          <h2><strong>London and the Midlands</strong></h2>

          <p>The work undertaken by one of the 2021 Senior Leadership Programme project groups and the enthusiasm of library service managers have combined to build commitment to expanding the existing South London Koha consortium to include other London libraries.</p>

          <p>Three services will have joined by the end of March, and two further expansion phases planned. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>A similar development is taking place in the Midlands, where a consortium of 10 library services in the Birmingham area have used a shared Koha system for some years.</p>

          <p>Following engagement with other services in the Midlands, a further 12 services will join during 2022 and 2023.</p>

          <p>HEE has used the Government’s G-Cloud Framework to directly procure Koha from PTFS Europe for both regions, and from April is fully funding the implementation costs as well as the ongoing hosting and management costs.</p>

          <h2><strong>North</strong></h2>

          <p>Last but definitely not least, the north, where the seven North East library services which have been using a shared system provided by OCLC are looking to be the next to have their shared catalogue integrated into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub.</p>

          <p>To date, most library services in the North West and in Yorkshire and Humber have continued to use existing local LMS &nbsp;– a wise move given the amount of system change which has taken place recently and impacted on library services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The introduction of a new library system is undoubtedly a significant change project) and the benefits of waiting to learn from others’ experience.</p>

          <p>As above, though, equity is one of our principles, and we don’t want any region to miss out, so we will continue conversations with northern service managers to progress regional LMS.</p>

          <h2><strong>Who’s making all this happen?</strong></h2>

          <p>In each region with an LMS implementation, extension or integration taking place, the managers of participating services are on steering groups with team members variously involved in project and module groups.&nbsp; We have also been fortunate to secure dedicated time from library staff who have stepped up as project managers and system managers and administrators.</p>

          <p>We have recently established a community of practice for everyone operating in these roles, for peer support, to share practice and experience, and to avoid duplication.</p>

          <p>One of the members of the group, Jenny Toller who is the SWIMS Lead in the South region, comments:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">"On-boarding a library into an existing LMS might seem like a technical exercise of moving records from one system to another, but there is so much more to it than that.&nbsp; One main learning point from recent experience is to get Information Governance and IT on board right from the very start of the project."</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">Emily Johnson, Project Manager for the Midlands notes:</p>

          <p style="margin-left:40px">“The work in the Midlands has very much been a collaborative process. We have been working hard to develop shared Circulation and Cataloguing rules. This has brought challenges at times; the proposed Midlands LMS includes close to 50 different libraries, many with their own historical rules which have been debated and worked through. We have now managed to gain a consensus which we believe will work best for library users in the region.”</p>

          <p>In 2010, at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust we developed CISSWeb (<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="http://www.cissweb.com">www.cissweb.com</a>), a clinical evidence search tracking, reporting and delivery system, hosted online.</p>

          <p>We developed this in response to the realisation that requesters were accessing library and evidence services in a variety of different ways, often through the librarian they had a previous relationship or connection with, and the work was being done and recorded in separate statistics by those individual librarians working at different sites.</p>

          <p>At UHL we have a team of four part time clinical librarians (CLs), and two professional librarians in the wider library team who perform literature searches.&nbsp; We also found that sometimes requesters were approaching more than one librarian to do the work, or more commonly, where clinicians were working in teams across specialties, each would contact their CL for the same topic. Adding into the mix that we work across three hospital library sites, it became clear that there was a need to record searches centrally.</p>

          <p>This also coincided with us having looked at how we branded our output and how we packaged our search results into “decision ready packages” for the requesters. At that time, we were working closely with the Trust’s e-learning team, who had expertise in web and graphic design.</p>

          <p>They helped us conceive a logo for both the Library and CL teams, and when we explained our needs in terms of workflow and branding, they designed a system for us that captured the details of a search request, allowed it to be assigned to the right person for the task, and stored the results as well as sending out the search summary and results package.</p>

          <p>CISSWeb is designed to be a light piece of software that records the details of a search request, and then sends out a template email with results as attachments. As we weren’t entirely sure how we would use it in the first instance, the team deliberately made as much as possible customisable.</p>

          <p>Development discussions led to us asking for four main features:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>a way of knowing who was working on what search questions,</li>
           <li>recording and sending results to requesters in a standardised but customisable format,</li>
           <li>recording evidence search statistics, and,</li>
           <li>gathering feedback.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Since its initial design and implementation, we have worked with an external web design company to improve on what we had, and we are now able to request for extra design features when needed.</p>

          <p>For example, allowing searches to be assigned to library staff at the point of entry to the system, as well as re-assigning to different staff if needed.</p>

          <p>When a search is entered onto the web form, it can be instantly assigned to a member of library staff, or left to be triaged on a pending requests page. The system automatically sets a deadline of 10 working days for searches to be returned to the requester, and sends reminders to the assigned librarian the day before it is due.</p>

          <p>This can be altered from within the admin end of the system. Searches can be completed on any platform, and the results can be uploaded in any file format. Summaries are placed within the body of the email that is sent with the attachment.</p>

          <p>This feature was important to us because of the experience we had had with occasionally forgetting to add attachments to emails and requesters responding that summary gave them all they needed to know anyway! Having the option to provide any file format is especially flexible when requesters have asked for Excel spreadsheets, or Word plus .ris files for those who may be writing with a view to publishing their work.</p>

          <p>When the emails are sent from CISSWeb, the librarian completing the search is also copied in, as well as a copy of the results and attachments saved to the system. Where full text articles are sent as attachments, these can be set to expire and be deleted from CISSWeb.</p>

          <p>There is also our standard but customisable disclaimer that goes into all emails, and a list of links to the resources that have been searched.</p>

          <p>When the requester receives their summary email, there is also a feedback link at the beginning and end of the summary, which leads them to a simple form on CISSWeb. Designed to be like eBay starred feedback, we ask for three ratings regarding to the speed of service received, the quality of the results, the impact the results have or will have on the clinical area, and a free text box.</p>

          <p>These four questions can also be altered from the admin panel within the database. CISSWeb sends a reminder email about the feedback, and this is currently set to 28 days after the original email is sent.</p>

          <p>It is also possible to go into the database and send a feedback reminder for individual searches that have been completed. The feedback is intended to be quick to complete and not onerous for the clinician, the idea being that we can always follow up for more details if needed.</p>

          <p>The statistics panel shows which professional groups the requests are coming from, what the intended purpose of the evidence is, and how the requests are received. Again, this is deliberately light, as we do not want to collect information for its own sake.</p>

          <p>The simplicity of CISSWeb is its major selling point for us in UHL. It isn’t a complicated system that focusses too much on the formatting of results and it allows us flexibility in how we answer evidence search requests. We hope to have designed the system so it could easily be used by anyone.</p>

          <p>If you’d like to know more about CISSWeb, or see it in action, please contact me.</p>

          <p>This also coincided with us having looked at how we branded our output and how we packaged our search results into “decision ready packages” for the requesters. At that time, we were working closely with the Trust’s e-learning team, who had expertise in web and graphic design.</p>

          <p>They helped us conceive a logo for both the Library and CL teams, and when we explained our needs in terms of workflow and branding, they designed a system for us that captured the details of a search request, allowed it to be assigned to the right person for the task, and stored the results as well as sending out the search summary and results package.</p>

          <p>CISSWeb is designed to be a light piece of software that records the details of a search request, and then sends out a template email with results as attachments. As we weren’t entirely sure how we would use it in the first instance, the team deliberately made as much as possible customisable.</p>

          <p>Development discussions led to us asking for four main features:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>a way of knowing who was working on what search questions,</li>
           <li>recording and sending results to requesters in a standardised but customisable format,</li>
           <li>recording evidence search statistics, and,</li>
           <li>gathering feedback.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Since its initial design and implementation, we have worked with an external web design company to improve on what we had, and we are now able to request for extra design features when needed.</p>

          <p>For example, allowing searches to be assigned to library staff at the point of entry to the system, as well as re-assigning to different staff if needed.</p>

          <p>When a search is entered onto the web form, it can be instantly assigned to a member of library staff, or left to be triaged on a pending requests page. The system automatically sets a deadline of 10 working days for searches to be returned to the requester, and sends reminders to the assigned librarian the day before it is due.</p>

          <p>This can be altered from within the admin end of the system. Searches can be completed on any platform, and the results can be uploaded in any file format. Summaries are placed within the body of the email that is sent with the attachment.</p>

          <p>This feature was important to us because of the experience we had had with occasionally forgetting to add attachments to emails and requesters responding that summary gave them all they needed to know anyway! Having the option to provide any file format is especially flexible when requesters have asked for Excel spreadsheets, or Word plus .ris files for those who may be writing with a view to publishing their work.</p>

          <p>When the emails are sent from CISSWeb, the librarian completing the search is also copied in, as well as a copy of the results and attachments saved to the system. Where full text articles are sent as attachments, these can be set to expire and be deleted from CISSWeb.</p>

          <p>There is also our standard but customisable disclaimer that goes into all emails, and a list of links to the resources that have been searched.</p>

          <p>When the requester receives their summary email, there is also a feedback link at the beginning and end of the summary, which leads them to a simple form on CISSWeb. Designed to be like eBay starred feedback, we ask for three ratings regarding to the speed of service received, the quality of the results, the impact the results have or will have on the clinical area, and a free text box.</p>

          <p>These four questions can also be altered from the admin panel within the database. CISSWeb sends a reminder email about the feedback, and this is currently set to 28 days after the original email is sent.</p>

          <p>It is also possible to go into the database and send a feedback reminder for individual searches that have been completed. The feedback is intended to be quick to complete and not onerous for the clinician, the idea being that we can always follow up for more details if needed.</p>

          <p>The statistics panel shows which professional groups the requests are coming from, what the intended purpose of the evidence is, and how the requests are received. Again, this is deliberately light, as we do not want to collect information for its own sake.</p>

          <p>The simplicity of CISSWeb is its major selling point for us in UHL. It isn’t a complicated system that focusses too much on the formatting of results and it allows us flexibility in how we answer evidence search requests. We hope to have designed the system so it could easily be used by anyone.</p>

          <p>If you’d like to know more about CISSWeb, or see it in action, please contact me.</p>

          <p>The team of Library &amp; Knowledge Service Managers across the Surrey Heartlands Health and Care Partnership successfully bid for non-recurrent funding to develop ‘Place-based Library &amp; Knowledge Services’ across the patch – delivering joined up library services for community-based staff across Surrey Heartlands. Kerry and Olwen led the project as Embedded Librarians, each working one day a week in addition to their roles as Evidence Librarians at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust (ESTH) and Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (ASPH).</p>

          <h2>A new ‘job-share’</h2>

          <p>We had exchanged emails and tweets but had never met in person – we still haven’t! It was a steep learning curve in terms of what the project involved - how we would deliver the services and how we would manage the time. Flexibility was key and to avoid imposing any time restrictions we agreed that the extra hours for the project work would fall on any day (accounting for existing commitments).</p>

          <p>We both felt very enthusiastic – boosted by the successful bid and enjoyable collaborative planning meetings. Crossing organisational boundaries ourselves whilst delivering services across the patch was a very positive experience. We positioned ourselves as the ‘face’ of library services, including our photos and contact details in any promotional opportunity, to personalise the offer.</p>

          <p>Surrey Heartlands is a partnership of health and care organisations, and identifying who was who across the patch was challenging, as was trying to find the right marketing channels. We worked hard to make the most of virtual introductions, and developed leaflets and advertising to suit various Intranets, newsletters &amp; noticeboards, devising catchy summaries of our offer to make it relevant to community-based staff who are traditionally less-well served.</p>

          <h2>Developing Munch &amp; Learns</h2>

          <p>We worked together to develop a suite of bite-size Munch &amp; Learn training sessions, 30 minutes long and delivered via MS Teams. Topics included Evidence Searching and Critical Appraisal Tips – it was great to share our knowledge and ideas whilst assembling the presentations. We were already familiar with MS Teams but this provided a good opportunity to experiment and master it together, and make use of additional features such as the Forms function.</p>

          <p>Later on we developed Twitter Tips for Professional Development, and enjoyed collaborating with our colleague Rosy Bennett, Knowledge and Systems Librarian at Royal Surrey, who runs an Oncology Journal Club via Twitter, and with Bongi Sibanda, Corporate Lead for Advanced Practice Education at ESTH. They shared their experiences via two short videos which we included in the Munch and Learn.</p>

          <p>Based on requests from our users, we expanded our skills to extend our support to staff undertaking Apprenticeships across the patch. On completion of a FutureLearn Report Writing course – and Kerry also attended an NHS Elect Report Writing course - we developed the Report Writing for Apprentices Munch &amp; Learn which has proved to be very popular and well received.</p>

It was easy to allocate the search requests to eachother, we were never overwhelmed by too many at once. We both manage our time in a similar way and never doubted our ability to meet deadlines. The search requests were interesting, many generated by mental health practitioners, as well as practice nurses and even a Chief Digital Officer.</p>

          <p>The Director of Nursing and Quality at Surrey Downs Health and Care Partnership and Sutton Health and Care, referred to librarians as ‘their critical friends’ – we had clearly made an impact and look forward to continuing our work via the new Dispersed Model as embedded knowledge specialists in the Surrey Training Hub.</p>

          <p>The team of Library &amp; Knowledge Service Managers across the Surrey Heartlands Health and Care Partnership successfully bid for non-recurrent funding to develop ‘Place-based Library &amp; Knowledge Services’ across the patch – delivering joined up library services for community-based staff across Surrey Heartlands. Kerry and Olwen led the project as Embedded Librarians, each working one day a week in addition to their roles as Evidence Librarians at Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust (ESTH) and Ashford and St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (ASPH).</p>

          <h2>A new ‘job-share’</h2>

          <p>We had exchanged emails and tweets but had never met in person – we still haven’t! It was a steep learning curve in terms of what the project involved - how we would deliver the services and how we would manage the time. Flexibility was key and to avoid imposing any time restrictions we agreed that the extra hours for the project work would fall on any day (accounting for existing commitments).</p>

          <p>We both felt very enthusiastic – boosted by the successful bid and enjoyable collaborative planning meetings. Crossing organisational boundaries ourselves whilst delivering services across the patch was a very positive experience. We positioned ourselves as the ‘face’ of library services, including our photos and contact details in any promotional opportunity, to personalise the offer.</p>

          <p>Surrey Heartlands is a partnership of health and care organisations, and identifying who was who across the patch was challenging, as was trying to find the right marketing channels. We worked hard to make the most of virtual introductions, and developed leaflets and advertising to suit various Intranets, newsletters &amp; noticeboards, devising catchy summaries of our offer to make it relevant to community-based staff who are traditionally less-well served.</p>

          <h2>Developing Munch &amp; Learns</h2>

          <p>We worked together to develop a suite of bite-size Munch &amp; Learn training sessions, 30 minutes long and delivered via MS Teams. Topics included Evidence Searching and Critical Appraisal Tips – it was great to share our knowledge and ideas whilst assembling the presentations. We were already familiar with MS Teams but this provided a good opportunity to experiment and master it together, and make use of additional features such as the Forms function.</p>

          <p>Later on we developed Twitter Tips for Professional Development, and enjoyed collaborating with our colleague Rosy Bennett, Knowledge and Systems Librarian at Royal Surrey, who runs an Oncology Journal Club via Twitter, and with Bongi Sibanda, Corporate Lead for Advanced Practice Education at ESTH. They shared their experiences via two short videos which we included in the Munch and Learn.</p>

          <p>Based on requests from our users, we expanded our skills to extend our support to staff undertaking Apprenticeships across the patch. On completion of a FutureLearn Report Writing course – and Kerry also attended an NHS Elect Report Writing course - we developed the Report Writing for Apprentices Munch &amp; Learn which has proved to be very popular and well received.</p>

          <h2>Undertaking Evidence Summaries</h2>

          <p>By January we were very excited to have started to receive requests for evidence summaries. We shared ideas for the layout and structure to agree a template, based on the summaries Olwen was already providing for staff at ASPH. Kerry attended HEE’s Synthesising and Summarising course to enhance her skills, and we were soon underway. It was easy to allocate the search requests to eachother, we were never overwhelmed by too many at once. We both manage our time in a similar way and never doubted our ability to meet deadlines. The search requests were interesting, many generated by mental health practitioners, as well as practice nurses and even a Chief Digital Officer.</p>

          <h2>Achievements</h2>

          <p>The infographic below demonstrates the key outcomes of the project. Other members of staff at ESTH were involved in additional projects during this time which also related to the benefits of delivering joined up library services for community-based staff across Surrey Heartlands. The projects included a Community of Practice and Innovation, Virtual Diabetes Webinar sessions, and the provision of training to make the most of the Clinicalskills.net resource. More information about these initiatives will be discussed in other related articles.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>

          <p>We gained a much better understanding of the roles and teams across Surrey Heartlands, the resources they need (we were able to purchase some new electronic journals), and the challenges they were facing. It was a useful insight, particularly during the pandemic, with staff off sick, or working from home with children learning remotely too, and the obvious impact of the increasing demands on their work being quite overwhelming at times.</p>

          <p>The Director of Nursing and Quality at Surrey Downs Health and Care Partnership and Sutton Health and Care, referred to librarians as ‘their critical friends’ – we had clearly made an impact and look forward to continuing our work via the new Dispersed Model as embedded knowledge specialists in the Surrey Training Hub.</p>

          <p>One of the most common queries through the NHS Copyright First Responders service is around the storing of articles.&nbsp; Mostly this is for ad hoc usage or integration into systems.&nbsp; How do you manage content being added to repositories?&nbsp; Who owns the copyright?</p>

          <p>You might just want to keep a repository of institute publications based on citations rather than full text content.&nbsp; This is OK. Under <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/60">UK copyright law</a>, if the material is published in a journal, you can make copies of the abstract available to the public.</p>

          <p>When you work in the NHS, your contract transfers the ownership of your work to your employing organisation.</p>

          <p>If working with multiple organisations, the question of copyright ownership should be ironed out in any group terms of reference or service level agreements. Most commonly it is the project sponsor e.g. <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.myresearchproject.org.uk/help/help%20documents/Model_Clinical_Trial_Agreement_mCTA_Jan_2021.docx">Commercial Model Clinical Trial Agreements</a>&nbsp;(mCTA January 2021) under section 11. Intellectual Property.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There may be greater uncertainty if the publication is grey literature or a review.&nbsp; When I began my work with Library &amp; Archive Copyright Alliance (LACA), we sought legal permission from our organisation that any work I do for LACA is the property of LACA and not the Trust I work for. Making it clear at the start of the process, saves a lot of time and potential legal challenges in the future.</p>

          <p>If you submit your article for external publication, check the publisher’s terms and conditions.&nbsp; Copyright will usually transfer across to the publisher, but that doesn’t mean you can’t include in your repository.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>First port of call is <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa RomEO Service</a> to check the publisher’s policy on deposits.&nbsp; If the publisher is not there, then you would need to gain permission from the copyright holder before adding to your repository.</p>

          <p>Some material may allow you to use without permission.&nbsp; Look out for schemes like the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a>, <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a><u>.</u></p>

          <p>If you think the material is out of copyright (check <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/copyright/how-long-copyright-lasts">regulations here</a><u>)</u>, you can use the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works#:~:text=Orphan%20works%20are%20creative%20works,unknown%20or%20cannot%20be%20found.">Public Domain Mark</a> attribution.&nbsp; These schemes clearly state permissions without the need to contact the copyright holder.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If looking to use clinical measuring scales it is worth checking out <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-clinical-content-repository-copyright-licensing-service/nccr-tools-and-measures-library">NCCR Tools &amp; Measures Library</a>, where permission has already been sought for use, but you need to register with the site to access.</p>

          <p>What happens if you are unable to trace the copyright holder, due to time or the organisation no longer exists?&nbsp; This is called an <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works#:~:text=Orphan%20works%20are%20creative%20works,unknown%20or%20cannot%20be%20found.">orphan work</a>.&nbsp; If you have done your due diligence to locate, and have had no luck, then you can apply for a licence to use the content.&nbsp; It is worth using this scheme and making sure there is a continuation of the licensing process for orphan works.</p>

          <p>These tips are also true for other types of copyrighted content e.g., images, music and videos.&nbsp; Some items may need multiple permissions e.g., posters in the background of films.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Please ensure that copyright permission is in order and also the correct consent forms have been signed to ensure a clear understanding of how the content can be re-used and shared either internally or externally to your organisation.&nbsp; Try to make the re-use of content explicit within your repository.&nbsp; Some useful notices can be found at <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en">Rights Statements</a>.</p>

          <p>The <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.cla.co.uk/sites/default/files/Licence-Plus-for-NHS-England.pdf">NHS Copyright Licence Plus</a>, allows for the saving of items on a secure Trust network (section 7.1).&nbsp; This can be an Intranet, secure group e.g. Teams or a clinical system.&nbsp; It doesn’t however allow the systematic collection of content to form a library (7.2), which is what a repository creates.&nbsp; There is also the additional risk that a subscription is cancelled, and the terms of licence would require the removal of the content (7.3). These clauses mean that the licence cannot be used to manage a repository.</p>

          <p>When dealing with copyright many decisions are based on risk calculation i.e., who owns the material, are they going to lose money by its use, are they likely to find out and are they likely to take legal action.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Internal only repositories are lower risk but consider if at some point in the future the repository is made public or merged.&nbsp; It is always worth making sure that content has the appropriate copyright clearance and consent, with correct re-use and attribution details from the start.&nbsp; Get it right and reduce the risk.</p>

          <p>As technology develops, you may wish to do more with your repository content.&nbsp; Can you use it for data mining or integrate into larger systems to improve discoverability? It is useful to check if your repository has standards which allow for transfer. <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/24683.html">ISO 14721:2003</a> reference model for an open archival information system (OAIS) is the key standard.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>One day will local repositories be integrated into the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.nhs.uk/knowledgehub/">Knowledge &amp; Library Hub</a> or services such as <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://core.ac.uk/">Core</a> which will open up the potential of the collections through the use of AI.&nbsp; It is worth considering how ready you are for integration and changes for the future where the “<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://uklaca.org/2019/01/03/the-right-to-read-should-mean-the-right-to-mine-for-the-sake-of-uk-prosperity/">right to read is the right to mine</a>”.</p>

          <p>Alongside the greater ability to re-use traditional collections is also the ability to develop commercialised products. In cash strapped services the ability to income generate from collections and services is tempting.&nbsp; It should however be noted that the act of digitisation does not create copyright for out of copyright works.&nbsp; <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://zenodo.org/record/6242611#.YjmPdOrP2Um">There is a culture</a> of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) licensing the reproduction of materials to create perpetual copyright.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There is also a need to further education librarians around copyright as we are more likely to say ‘no’ to the re-use of material, before considering how it can be re-used.&nbsp; Evidence indicates that it is more expensive to generate income from these developments, than to set the information free.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>It is therefore recommended that when considering re-use of repository output, you should consider CC0 for non-original reproduced media and CC BY for original content to gain the widest possible use.&nbsp; Librarians need to be the advocates for a digital future where we can do more with the information we store.</p>

          <p>One of the most common queries through the NHS Copyright First Responders service is around the storing of articles.&nbsp; Mostly this is for ad hoc usage or integration into systems.&nbsp; How do you manage content being added to repositories?&nbsp; Who owns the copyright?</p>

          <p>You might just want to keep a repository of institute publications based on citations rather than full text content.&nbsp; This is OK. Under <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/60">UK copyright law</a>, if the material is published in a journal, you can make copies of the abstract available to the public.</p>

          <p>When you work in the NHS, your contract transfers the ownership of your work to your employing organisation.</p>

          <p>If working with multiple organisations, the question of copyright ownership should be ironed out in any group terms of reference or service level agreements. Most commonly it is the project sponsor e.g. <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.myresearchproject.org.uk/help/help%20documents/Model_Clinical_Trial_Agreement_mCTA_Jan_2021.docx">Commercial Model Clinical Trial Agreements</a>&nbsp;(mCTA January 2021) under section 11. Intellectual Property.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There may be greater uncertainty if the publication is grey literature or a review.&nbsp; When I began my work with Library &amp; Archive Copyright Alliance (LACA), we sought legal permission from our organisation that any work I do for LACA is the property of LACA and not the Trust I work for. Making it clear at the start of the process, saves a lot of time and potential legal challenges in the future.</p>

          <p>If you submit your article for external publication, check the publisher’s terms and conditions.&nbsp; Copyright will usually transfer across to the publisher, but that doesn’t mean you can’t include in your repository.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>First port of call is <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">Sherpa RomEO Service</a> to check the publisher’s policy on deposits.&nbsp; If the publisher is not there, then you would need to gain permission from the copyright holder before adding to your repository.</p>

          <p>Some material may allow you to use without permission.&nbsp; Look out for schemes like the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">Open Government Licence</a>, <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a><u>.</u></p>

          <p>If you think the material is out of copyright (check <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/copyright/how-long-copyright-lasts">regulations here</a><u>)</u>, you can use the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works#:~:text=Orphan%20works%20are%20creative%20works,unknown%20or%20cannot%20be%20found.">Public Domain Mark</a> attribution.&nbsp; These schemes clearly state permissions without the need to contact the copyright holder.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If looking to use clinical measuring scales it is worth checking out <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-clinical-content-repository-copyright-licensing-service/nccr-tools-and-measures-library">NCCR Tools &amp; Measures Library</a>, where permission has already been sought for use, but you need to register with the site to access.</p>

          <p>What happens if you are unable to trace the copyright holder, due to time or the organisation no longer exists?&nbsp; This is called an <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/copyright-orphan-works#:~:text=Orphan%20works%20are%20creative%20works,unknown%20or%20cannot%20be%20found.">orphan work</a>.&nbsp; If you have done your due diligence to locate, and have had no luck, then you can apply for a licence to use the content.&nbsp; It is worth using this scheme and making sure there is a continuation of the licensing process for orphan works.</p>

          <p>These tips are also true for other types of copyrighted content e.g., images, music and videos.&nbsp; Some items may need multiple permissions e.g., posters in the background of films.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Please ensure that copyright permission is in order and also the correct consent forms have been signed to ensure a clear understanding of how the content can be re-used and shared either internally or externally to your organisation.&nbsp; Try to make the re-use of content explicit within your repository.&nbsp; Some useful notices can be found at <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://rightsstatements.org/page/1.0/?language=en">Rights Statements</a>.</p>

          <p>The <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.cla.co.uk/sites/default/files/Licence-Plus-for-NHS-England.pdf">NHS Copyright Licence Plus</a>, allows for the saving of items on a secure Trust network (section 7.1).&nbsp; This can be an Intranet, secure group e.g. Teams or a clinical system.&nbsp; It doesn’t however allow the systematic collection of content to form a library (7.2), which is what a repository creates.&nbsp; There is also the additional risk that a subscription is cancelled, and the terms of licence would require the removal of the content (7.3). These clauses mean that the licence cannot be used to manage a repository.</p>

          <p>When dealing with copyright many decisions are based on risk calculation i.e., who owns the material, are they going to lose money by its use, are they likely to find out and are they likely to take legal action.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Internal only repositories are lower risk but consider if at some point in the future the repository is made public or merged.&nbsp; It is always worth making sure that content has the appropriate copyright clearance and consent, with correct re-use and attribution details from the start.&nbsp; Get it right and reduce the risk.</p>

          <p>As technology develops, you may wish to do more with your repository content.&nbsp; Can you use it for data mining or integrate into larger systems to improve discoverability? It is useful to check if your repository has standards which allow for transfer. <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/24683.html">ISO 14721:2003</a> reference model for an open archival information system (OAIS) is the key standard.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>One day will local repositories be integrated into the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.nhs.uk/knowledgehub/">Knowledge &amp; Library Hub</a> or services such as <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://core.ac.uk/">Core</a> which will open up the potential of the collections through the use of AI.&nbsp; It is worth considering how ready you are for integration and changes for the future where the “<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://uklaca.org/2019/01/03/the-right-to-read-should-mean-the-right-to-mine-for-the-sake-of-uk-prosperity/">right to read is the right to mine</a>”.</p>

          <p>Alongside the greater ability to re-use traditional collections is also the ability to develop commercialised products. In cash strapped services the ability to income generate from collections and services is tempting.&nbsp; It should however be noted that the act of digitisation does not create copyright for out of copyright works.&nbsp; <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://zenodo.org/record/6242611#.YjmPdOrP2Um">There is a culture</a> of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums (GLAMs) licensing the reproduction of materials to create perpetual copyright.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There is also a need to further education librarians around copyright as we are more likely to say ‘no’ to the re-use of material, before considering how it can be re-used.&nbsp; Evidence indicates that it is more expensive to generate income from these developments, than to set the information free.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>It is therefore recommended that when considering re-use of repository output, you should consider CC0 for non-original reproduced media and CC BY for original content to gain the widest possible use.&nbsp; Librarians need to be the advocates for a digital future where we can do more with the information we store.</p>

          <p><strong>The bid background</strong></p>

          <p>In August 2020, Health Education England had some non-recurrent funding available for library and knowledge services developments in England in the 2020 - 2021 financial year.&nbsp; The focus for the funding was supporting LKS services that support the move towards “place-based” systems of care by advancing “place-based” library services where partners work together to ensure that all staff and learners in a locality benefit from a coherent service offer, including those who are currently less well served.&nbsp; Bids for up to £25,000 were welcomed and each proposal was judged against a selection criteria.</p>

          <p><strong>The Surrey Heartlands proposal</strong></p>

          <p>In the Surrey area, we the Library and Knowledge Services Managers Potenza Atiogbe (Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust), Rachel Cooke (Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust) and Alison Paul (Ashford &amp; St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) and Vicki Veness (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust) discussed putting together a proposal for the Surrey Heartlands community non-medical staff (e.g. nurses and allied health professionals) working in the Surrey Downs area (Surrey Downs Healthcare), Guildford and Waverley, Northwest Surrey and East Surrey. Suzy Thompson (Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust) joined in with the proposal later when it was established that some of the users in the Surrey Heartlands Integrated Care System (ICS) work in the Frimley area.&nbsp; The Lead for the project was Potenza Atiogbe.</p>

           <li>There was a need for a more joined up library service approach for Surrey Heartlands.&nbsp; We did not have a clear idea of the exact number and the nature of the literature searches that are being conducted for Surrey Heartlands staff.</li>
           <li>Surrey Heartlands staff are involved in transformative work on a regular basis but staff do not fully realise that their work is innovative and should be shared with others not only within the organisation and partner organisations but further afield. There appears to be a lot of silo working still taking place within the organisation.&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Community staff need a basic understanding of what research is from a library support perspective, the different types of research papers and how to get published. They also needed access to a relevant statistical package and training support.</li>
           <li>Community staff need support to encourage more research in the community, more publications (all types e.g. posters, internal publications, peer reviewed publications, and websites including the Academy of Fabulous NHS Stuff), increased business cases and quality improvement projects.&nbsp; All of these require the appropriate evidence base and a degree of knowledge mobilisation.</li>
           <li>There is a gap in knowledge about the library resources, services and support available to enable evidence based practice for both PCN and community staff.&nbsp; Therefore there was a need to actively promote and highlight the library services and training. Community staff have access to MS Teams and use it for other training sessions.</li>
           <li>The PCNs need to understand the value of the 10 new roles in primary care.&nbsp; They would appreciate case studies from other organisations which demonstrate the value of these new roles.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>The proposal</strong></p>

          <p>We put together a bid of £25,000 for the following:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Funding embedded librarians for two days a week for six months.&nbsp; Two members of part-time staff – Olwen Revill (Ashford &amp; St Peter’s Hospitals) and Kerry Seelhoff (Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals) agreed to work an additional day each to lead on the project together and deliver bite sized training sessions via MS Teams.</li>
           <li>Funding a software development for KnowledgeShare to facilitate adequate tracking and sharing of Surrey Heartlands literature searches.</li>
           <li>Developing a virtual community of practice and innovation (COPi) focused on library support for quality improvement with a paid facilitator.&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Funding a bespoke research workshop for the open source statistical package JASP which is similar to IBM’s Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).</li>

          <p><strong>Achievements and changes to the original proposal</strong></p>

          <p>The infographic below demonstrates the key outcomes of the project. More details about the achievements of the project are discussed in other related articles.</p>

          <p>The embedded librarians worked for nine months as opposed to six months due to some areas of the project costing less than already anticipated.&nbsp; The virtual COPi was facilitated by Potenza Atiogbe and Marisa Martinez Ortiz (Technology Enhanced Learning Lead and Deputy Head of Library Services) so no additional costs were incurred.&nbsp; The software development for KnowledgeShare has been completed in January 2022.&nbsp; This means that all the Surrey LKS can work together to share the Surrey Heartlands searches.</p>

          <p>This article is one of a series of articles about this bid which highlight the benefits of all the Surrey LKS working together to deliver joined up library services for community-based staff in Surrey Heartlands.&nbsp; Figure 1 is an infographic that highlights the key outcomes of the nine month project.</p>

          <p><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></p>

          <p>As a result of the initial funding and the project, we were able to showcase a myriad of LKS skills from evidence searches, cataloguing and classification via ClinicalSkills.net and Technology Enhanced Learning.</p>

          <p>Kerry Seelhoff was upgraded from a Band 5 to Band 6.&nbsp; Comprehensive evidence was compiled for the job matching process during the project.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Various team members were invited to be part of Surrey Heartlands ICS meetings including the Surrey Downs Integrated Care Partnership People's Group - Sub Committee.</p>

          <p>The outcomes of this project enabled us to successfully bid for the HEE-funded Surrey Training Hub Knowledge and Library Service 24 month post, and to contribute to the successful bid with the other South West London Health Libraries, for the HEE-funded South West London Training Hub Knowledge and Library Service 24 month post.</p>

          <p><strong>The bid background</strong></p>

          <p>In August 2020, Health Education England had some non-recurrent funding available for library and knowledge services developments in England in the 2020 - 2021 financial year.&nbsp; The focus for the funding was supporting LKS services that support the move towards “place-based” systems of care by advancing “place-based” library services where partners work together to ensure that all staff and learners in a locality benefit from a coherent service offer, including those who are currently less well served.&nbsp; Bids for up to £25,000 were welcomed and each proposal was judged against a selection criteria.</p>

          <p><strong>The Surrey Heartlands proposal</strong></p>

          <p>In the Surrey area, we the Library and Knowledge Services Managers Potenza Atiogbe (Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust), Rachel Cooke (Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust) and Alison Paul (Ashford &amp; St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) and Vicki Veness (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust) discussed putting together a proposal for the Surrey Heartlands community non-medical staff (e.g. nurses and allied health professionals) working in the Surrey Downs area (Surrey Downs Healthcare), Guildford and Waverley, Northwest Surrey and East Surrey. Suzy Thompson (Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust) joined in with the proposal later when it was established that some of the users in the Surrey Heartlands Integrated Care System (ICS) work in the Frimley area.&nbsp; The Lead for the project was Potenza Atiogbe.</p>

          <p><strong>The bid background</strong></p>

          <p>In August 2020, Health Education England had some non-recurrent funding available for library and knowledge services developments in England in the 2020 - 2021 financial year.&nbsp; The focus for the funding was supporting LKS services that support the move towards “place-based” systems of care by advancing “place-based” library services where partners work together to ensure that all staff and learners in a locality benefit from a coherent service offer, including those who are currently less well served.&nbsp; Bids for up to £25,000 were welcomed and each proposal was judged against a selection criteria.</p>

          <p><strong>The Surrey Heartlands proposal</strong></p>

          <p>In the Surrey area, we the Library and Knowledge Services Managers Potenza Atiogbe (Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust), Rachel Cooke (Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust) and Alison Paul (Ashford &amp; St Peter’s Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) and Vicki Veness (Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust) discussed putting together a proposal for the Surrey Heartlands community non-medical staff (e.g. nurses and allied health professionals) working in the Surrey Downs area (Surrey Downs Healthcare), Guildford and Waverley, Northwest Surrey and East Surrey. Suzy Thompson (Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust) joined in with the proposal later when it was established that some of the users in the Surrey Heartlands Integrated Care System (ICS) work in the Frimley area.&nbsp; The Lead for the project was Potenza Atiogbe.</p>

          <p><strong>Stakeholder engagement</strong></p>

          <p>We approached a number of stakeholders including the Director of Nursing and Quality (Sutton Health and Care and Surrey Downs Health and Care), Learning Environment Lead and the Head of Learning and Development, Skills Design and Organisational Development (Central Surrey Health), staff coordinating events for the Primary Care Networks (PCNs) for Surrey Downs and staff from the Surrey Training Hub to help to shape the proposal.</p>

        jcr:primaryType: hippostd:html
        hippostd:content: |-
          <p><strong>Our conclusions</strong></p>

          <p>From the stakeholder discussions we established the following:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>There was a need for a more joined up library service approach for Surrey Heartlands.&nbsp; We did not have a clear idea of the exact number and the nature of the literature searches that are being conducted for Surrey Heartlands staff.</li>
           <li>Surrey Heartlands staff are involved in transformative work on a regular basis but staff do not fully realise that their work is innovative and should be shared with others not only within the organisation and partner organisations but further afield. There appears to be a lot of silo working still taking place within the organisation.&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Community staff need a basic understanding of what research is from a library support perspective, the different types of research papers and how to get published. They also needed access to a relevant statistical package and training support.</li>
           <li>Community staff need support to encourage more research in the community, more publications (all types e.g. posters, internal publications, peer reviewed publications, and websites including the Academy of Fabulous NHS Stuff), increased business cases and quality improvement projects.&nbsp; All of these require the appropriate evidence base and a degree of knowledge mobilisation.</li>
           <li>There is a gap in knowledge about the library resources, services and support available to enable evidence based practice for both PCN and community staff.&nbsp; Therefore there was a need to actively promote and highlight the library services and training. Community staff have access to MS Teams and use it for other training sessions.</li>
           <li>The PCNs need to understand the value of the 10 new roles in primary care.&nbsp; They would appreciate case studies from other organisations which demonstrate the value of these new roles.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>The proposal</strong></p>

          <p>We put together a bid of £25,000 for the following:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Funding embedded librarians for two days a week for six months.&nbsp; Two members of part-time staff – Olwen Revill (Ashford &amp; St Peter’s Hospitals) and Kerry Seelhoff (Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals) agreed to work an additional day each to lead on the project together and deliver bite sized training sessions via MS Teams.</li>
           <li>Funding a software development for KnowledgeShare to facilitate adequate tracking and sharing of Surrey Heartlands literature searches.</li>
           <li>Developing a virtual community of practice and innovation (COPi) focused on library support for quality improvement with a paid facilitator.&nbsp;</li>
           <li>Funding a bespoke research workshop for the open source statistical package JASP which is similar to IBM’s Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Achievements and changes to the original proposal</strong></p>

          <p>The infographic below demonstrates the key outcomes of the project. More details about the achievements of the project are discussed in other related articles.</p>

          <p>The embedded librarians worked for nine months as opposed to six months due to some areas of the project costing less than already anticipated.&nbsp; The virtual COPi was facilitated by Potenza Atiogbe and Marisa Martinez Ortiz (Technology Enhanced Learning Lead and Deputy Head of Library Services) so no additional costs were incurred.&nbsp; The software development for KnowledgeShare has been completed in January 2022.&nbsp; This means that all the Surrey LKS can work together to share the Surrey Heartlands searches.</p>

          <p>This article is one of a series of articles about this bid which highlight the benefits of all the Surrey LKS working together to deliver joined up library services for community-based staff in Surrey Heartlands.&nbsp; Figure 1 is an infographic that highlights the key outcomes of the nine month project.</p>

          <p><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></p>

          <p>As a result of the initial funding and the project, we were able to showcase a myriad of LKS skills from evidence searches, cataloguing and classification via ClinicalSkills.net and Technology Enhanced Learning.</p>

          <p>Kerry Seelhoff was upgraded from a Band 5 to Band 6.&nbsp; Comprehensive evidence was compiled for the job matching process during the project.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Various team members were invited to be part of Surrey Heartlands ICS meetings including the Surrey Downs Integrated Care Partnership People's Group - Sub Committee.</p>

          <p>The outcomes of this project enabled us to successfully bid for the HEE-funded Surrey Training Hub Knowledge and Library Service 24 month post, and to contribute to the successful bid with the other South West London Health Libraries, for the HEE-funded South West London Training Hub Knowledge and Library Service 24 month post.</p>

          <p>Every year, vast numbers of research articles are published in academic journals. It is estimated that in the biomedical field alone, more than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7612-457a">a million papers</a> are added to the PubMed database each year; NIHR funded research results in several thousand articles a month. Many contain insights which could help inform best practice, shape policy or influence decision making.</p>

          <p>Over recent years, Open Access policies <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/who-we-are/our-policies-and-guidelines/open-access-policy-review.htm">like the NIHR’s</a> mean that many of these articles have become free to read online and no longer sit behind paywalls. This is a major step forward. But the articles are often long and packed with technical jargon that is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Open Access is only part of the solution.</p>

          <p>At <a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR Evidence,</a> we believe that everyone should have easy access to research findings. Here, you’ll find plain language summaries of health and care research that’s funded by the NIHR and selected for its strategic or clinical significance. This is research that should be acted on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Simple summaries</strong></h2>

          <p>These summaries are valuable for everyone searching for the latest research on care or treatment. That includes time-pressured health or care professionals, and members of the public. Commissioners and policy makers who need evidence on the effectiveness of treatments and care policies will also find them useful.</p>

          <p>Some of our summaries are of single NIHR research studies; others combine several NIHR research studies within a specific theme or health and care topic. Over the last year we’ve also been exploring non-written formats, such as podcasts and graphics, to communicate the results of NIHR-supported research.</p>

          <h2><strong>Working in partnership</strong></h2>

          <p>We work in close collaboration with patients, the public and professionals to ensure our summaries are as useful and usable as possible. We work together to select the NIHR-funded research studies that are most likely to be of interest to the public and professionals and to inform changes to policy or practice.</p>

          <p>In partnership with study authors, our team of professional writers write up the findings in plain English and highlight the difference they could make. Members of the public, people with lived experience, professionals and relevant organisations provide comments to help set the research in context.</p>

          <h2><strong>Reliable and robust</strong></h2>

          <p>NIHR Evidence provides accessible summaries of some of the most important findings, and brings them to a wide audience. Our summaries are based on research papers that have already been peer-reviewed by medical and scientific experts. They are a reliable source of information. This is vitally important at a time when the pandemic has shown us the huge appetite for health information but also the wide spread of misinformation.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The NIHR’s ambition is to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research. Making the research we fund and support more accessible is core to that ambition.</p>

          <p>Explore the <a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR Evidence website</a>. The summaries can also be accessed via the <a>NHS Knowledge and Library Hub</a>.</p>

          <p>Every year, vast numbers of research articles are published in academic journals. It is estimated that in the biomedical field alone, more than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nj7612-457a">a million papers</a> are added to the PubMed database each year; NIHR funded research results in several thousand articles a month. Many contain insights which could help inform best practice, shape policy or influence decision making.</p>

          <p>Over recent years, Open Access policies <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/who-we-are/our-policies-and-guidelines/open-access-policy-review.htm">like the NIHR’s</a> mean that many of these articles have become free to read online and no longer sit behind paywalls. This is a major step forward. But the articles are often long and packed with technical jargon that is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Open Access is only part of the solution.</p>

          <p>At <a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR Evidence,</a> we believe that everyone should have easy access to research findings. Here, you’ll find plain language summaries of health and care research that’s funded by the NIHR and selected for its strategic or clinical significance. This is research that should be acted on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Simple summaries</strong></h2>

          <p>These summaries are valuable for everyone searching for the latest research on care or treatment. That includes time-pressured health or care professionals, and members of the public. Commissioners and policy makers who need evidence on the effectiveness of treatments and care policies will also find them useful.</p>

          <p>Some of our summaries are of single NIHR research studies; others combine several NIHR research studies within a specific theme or health and care topic. Over the last year we’ve also been exploring non-written formats, such as podcasts and graphics, to communicate the results of NIHR-supported research.</p>

          <h2><strong>Working in partnership</strong></h2>

          <p>We work in close collaboration with patients, the public and professionals to ensure our summaries are as useful and usable as possible. We work together to select the NIHR-funded research studies that are most likely to be of interest to the public and professionals and to inform changes to policy or practice.</p>

          <p>In partnership with study authors, our team of professional writers write up the findings in plain English and highlight the difference they could make. Members of the public, people with lived experience, professionals and relevant organisations provide comments to help set the research in context.</p>

          <h2><strong>Reliable and robust</strong></h2>

          <p>NIHR Evidence provides accessible summaries of some of the most important findings, and brings them to a wide audience. Our summaries are based on research papers that have already been peer-reviewed by medical and scientific experts. They are a reliable source of information. This is vitally important at a time when the pandemic has shown us the huge appetite for health information but also the wide spread of misinformation.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The NIHR’s ambition is to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research. Making the research we fund and support more accessible is core to that ambition.</p>

          <p>The search and discovery infrastructure for the NHS in England has been transformed over the past year.&nbsp; As part of the project to launch the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub, HEE has made a suite of products from <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/">Third Iron</a> available across the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>This post recaps on those products and takes a closer look at one: LibKey Nomad. Setting up Nomad takes effort but is well worth it. We hear below from Library Managers who’ve done it. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>The LibKey products</strong></h2>

          <p>All these take the holdings data in the EBSCO link resolver, HLM, and make it work really hard:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-discovery/"><strong>LibKey Discovery</strong></a><strong>: </strong>enhances the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub with one-click access to PDF articles, plus links back to the full journals issues – for over 28,000 journals.</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/browzine/"><strong>BrowZine Web</strong></a><strong>: </strong>allows users to easily browse all the journals available to them, whether nationally or locally purchased.</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-link/"><strong>LibKey Link:</strong></a> works with core content databases and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000054511">Google Scholar</a>, providing<strong> </strong>one-click access PDF articles or an article request form where full-text is not available. &nbsp;We also recommend that set it up to work with <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000039271">PubMed</a> if you haven’t yet done so.</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-nomad/"><strong>LibKey Nomad:</strong></a><strong> </strong>goes a step further, providing<strong> </strong>one-click link to full-text articles (or a request form) when users are searching the open web, e.g. via Google, Wikipedia or publisher websites.&nbsp;</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-io/"><strong>LibKey.io:</strong></a><strong> </strong>provides a local landing page for DOI and PubMed ID searching of subscribed and open access resources – great for quickly accessing full text or making an ILL request with just a DOI or PubMed ID.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><strong>The beauty of LibKey Nomad</strong></h2>

          <p>However much effort we put into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub and local library websites, many users will start a search for articles with Google or similar. They may arrive on a publisher website, but quite likely miss links to NHS-funded articles or even formally published open access articles.</p>

          <p>LibKey Nomad effectively makes your journal holdings – and open access articles included in the Unpaywall data set – available to users through the open web.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Nomad is a browser plug-in which works with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave and Vivaldi.&nbsp; Basically, when a user lands on a publisher website, for instance when following a link from Google, LibKey Nomad quickly scans the page for a DOI of the article and matches it against your holdings.&nbsp; This happens very quickly - usually within a fraction of a second.</p>

          <p>If you have full-text access to the article, the LibKey button appears at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, offering either “download PDF” or “article link” (see fig 1).</p>

          will say “access options.” This in turn offers the link to the NHS Knowledge
          and Library Hub request form (see fig. 2)</p>

          <h2><strong>Installing LibKey Nomad</strong></h2>

          <p>Users can <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/downloadnomad/">install LibKey Nomad</a> on their own devices. On first use they’ll need to select the appropriate NHS organisation to link to, but after that Nomad should remember.</p>

          <p>Depending on local IT policy, users may also be able to <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/downloadnomad/">install LibKey Nomad</a> on NHS devices.</p>

          <p>For maximum potential benefit and to avoid users having to do anything, the ideal is Trust-wide deployment by your IT Department.</p>

          <p>This obviously requires engagement with the IT Team. HEE’s <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000035749">briefing to IT departments</a> may help, and Third Iron offer lots of <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000570000-libkey-nomad-for-it-professionals">additional information aimed at IT professionals</a> on their website, including assurances on privacy.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Group policy deployment instructions are also available:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000570002-libkey-nomad-group-policy-deployment-chrome-">LibKey Nomad Group Policy Deployment (Chrome)</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000570004-libkey-nomad-group-policy-deployment-edge-">LibKey Nomad Group Policy Deployment (Edge)</a></li>
           <li><a href="https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000570003-libkey-nomad-group-policy-deployment-firefox-">LibKey Nomad Group Policy Deployment (Firefox).</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Here, Library Services Managers in four trusts which have successfully rolled out Nomad share tips and experience:&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Helen Swales, Library Service Manager, has worked with her IT department to get Trust-wide deployment of LibKey Nomad on both Edge and Chrome.&nbsp; Her IT contact has passed on <a href="lch-libkey.odt">these instructions</a>&nbsp;which he thought might be of interest to other IT departments.</p>

          <p>Helen had introduced her Trust to BrowZine prior to the national subscription.&nbsp; Read her blog post about it: “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/easy-access-to-journal-articles-our-most-popular-training-course-ever/">Easy access to journal articles - our most popular training course ever!”</a></p>

          <h2><strong>Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Library Manager, Federica Bianchini, and Knowledge Manager, Melanie Dawson-Jones, were able to get LibKey Nomad rolled out across the Trust early last year. They had gained support from senior colleagues and successfully submitted a business case to the IT Committee. Read more in their blog posts: “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/libkey-nomad-roll-out-process-at-bradford-district-care-nhs-trust/">LibKey Nomad - roll-out process at Bradford District Care NHS Trust</a>” and “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/libkey-nomad-closing-the-gap-with-document-supply-requests/">LibKey Nomad - closing the gap with document supply requests.</a>”</p>

          <h2><strong>Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Claire Bradley, Library Manager, started conversations to get LibKey Nomad rolled-out soon after the national access became available. Read her <a href="coventry-and-warwickshire---feedback-on-roll-out-of-libkey-nomad-to-all-trust-computers.odt">reflections</a>.</p>

          <h2><strong>Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Lisa Riddington and Claire O’Connor from the Library Team started their successful Trust-wide rollout by persuading the Medical Director and Head of IT about the money and time saving potential of Nomad, and the way it could contributing to the Trust’s strategic goals of increasing research activity.&nbsp; Read Lisa’s <a href="gloucestershire-hospitals-e-mail.odt">persuasive email</a>.</p>

          <p>We hope the stories above may inspire you to try to get Nomad rolled out in your organisation. Do let me know how you get on!</p>

          <p>The search and discovery infrastructure for the NHS in England has been transformed over the past year.&nbsp; As part of the project to launch the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub, HEE has made a suite of products from <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/">Third Iron</a> available across the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>This post recaps on those products and takes a closer look at one: LibKey Nomad. Setting up Nomad takes effort but is well worth it. We hear below from Library Managers who’ve done it. &nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>The LibKey products</strong></h2>

          <p>All these take the holdings data in the EBSCO link resolver, HLM, and make it work really hard:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-discovery/"><strong>LibKey Discovery</strong></a><strong>: </strong>enhances the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub with one-click access to PDF articles, plus links back to the full journals issues – for over 28,000 journals.</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/browzine/"><strong>BrowZine Web</strong></a><strong>: </strong>allows users to easily browse all the journals available to them, whether nationally or locally purchased.</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-link/"><strong>LibKey Link:</strong></a> works with core content databases and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000054511">Google Scholar</a>, providing<strong> </strong>one-click access PDF articles or an article request form where full-text is not available. &nbsp;We also recommend that set it up to work with <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000039271">PubMed</a> if you haven’t yet done so.</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-nomad/"><strong>LibKey Nomad:</strong></a><strong> </strong>goes a step further, providing<strong> </strong>one-click link to full-text articles (or a request form) when users are searching the open web, e.g. via Google, Wikipedia or publisher websites.&nbsp;</li>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-io/"><strong>LibKey.io:</strong></a><strong> </strong>provides a local landing page for DOI and PubMed ID searching of subscribed and open access resources – great for quickly accessing full text or making an ILL request with just a DOI or PubMed ID.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2><strong>The beauty of LibKey Nomad</strong></h2>

          <p>However much effort we put into the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub and local library websites, many users will start a search for articles with Google or similar. They may arrive on a publisher website, but quite likely miss links to NHS-funded articles or even formally published open access articles.</p>

          <p>LibKey Nomad effectively makes your journal holdings – and open access articles included in the Unpaywall data set – available to users through the open web.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Nomad is a browser plug-in which works with Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave and Vivaldi.&nbsp; Basically, when a user lands on a publisher website, for instance when following a link from Google, LibKey Nomad quickly scans the page for a DOI of the article and matches it against your holdings.&nbsp; This happens very quickly - usually within a fraction of a second.</p>

          <p>If you have full-text access to the article, the LibKey button appears at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen, offering either “download PDF” or “article link” (see fig 1).</p>

          <h2><strong>Installing LibKey Nomad</strong></h2>

          <p>Users can <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/downloadnomad/">install LibKey Nomad</a> on their own devices. On first use they’ll need to select the appropriate NHS organisation to link to, but after that Nomad should remember.</p>

          <p>Depending on local IT policy, users may also be able to <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://thirdiron.com/downloadnomad/">install LibKey Nomad</a> on NHS devices.</p>

          <p>For maximum potential benefit and to avoid users having to do anything, the ideal is Trust-wide deployment by your IT Department.</p>

          <p>This obviously requires engagement with the IT Team. HEE’s <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000035749">briefing to IT departments</a> may help, and Third Iron offer lots of <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000570000-libkey-nomad-for-it-professionals">additional information aimed at IT professionals</a> on their website, including assurances on privacy.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Group policy deployment instructions are also available:</p>

          <ul>
           <li><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://support.thirdiron.com/support/solutions/articles/72000570002-libkey-nomad-group-policy-deployment-chrome-">LibKey Nomad Group Policy Deployment (Chrome)</a></li>

          </ul>

          <p>Here, Library Services Managers in four trusts which have successfully rolled out Nomad share tips and experience:&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Helen Swales, Library Service Manager, has worked with her IT department to get Trust-wide deployment of LibKey Nomad on both Edge and Chrome.&nbsp; Her IT contact has passed on <a href="lch-libkey.odt">these instructions</a>&nbsp;which he thought might be of interest to other IT departments.</p>

          <p>Helen had introduced her Trust to BrowZine prior to the national subscription.&nbsp; Read her blog post about it: “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/easy-access-to-journal-articles-our-most-popular-training-course-ever/">Easy access to journal articles - our most popular training course ever!”</a></p>

          <h2><strong>Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Library Manager, Federica Bianchini, and Knowledge Manager, Melanie Dawson-Jones, were able to get LibKey Nomad rolled out across the Trust early last year. They had gained support from senior colleagues and successfully submitted a business case to the IT Committee. Read more in their blog posts: “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/libkey-nomad-roll-out-process-at-bradford-district-care-nhs-trust/">LibKey Nomad - roll-out process at Bradford District Care NHS Trust</a>” and “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/libkey-nomad-closing-the-gap-with-document-supply-requests/">LibKey Nomad - closing the gap with document supply requests.</a>”</p>

          <h2><strong>Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Claire Bradley, Library Manager, started conversations to get LibKey Nomad rolled-out soon after the national access became available. Read her <a href="coventry-and-warwickshire---feedback-on-roll-out-of-libkey-nomad-to-all-trust-computers.odt">reflections</a>.</p>

          <h2><strong>Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Lisa Riddington and Claire O’Connor from the Library Team started their successful Trust-wide rollout by persuading the Medical Director and Head of IT about the money and time saving potential of Nomad, and the way it could contributing to the Trust’s strategic goals of increasing research activity.&nbsp; Read Lisa’s <a href="gloucestershire-hospitals-e-mail.odt">persuasive email</a>.</p>

          <p>We hope the stories above may inspire you to try to get Nomad rolled out in your organisation. Do let me know how you get on!</p>

          <p>Here, Library Services Managers in four trusts which have successfully rolled out Nomad share tips and experience:&nbsp;</p>

          <h2><strong>Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Helen Swales, Library Service Manager, has worked with her IT department to get Trust-wide deployment of LibKey Nomad on both Edge and Chrome.&nbsp; Her IT contact has passed on <a href="lch-libkey.odt">these instructions</a>&nbsp;which he thought might be of interest to other IT departments.</p>

          <p>Helen had introduced her Trust to BrowZine prior to the national subscription.&nbsp; Read her blog post about it: “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/easy-access-to-journal-articles-our-most-popular-training-course-ever/">Easy access to journal articles - our most popular training course ever!”</a></p>

          <h2><strong>Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Library Manager, Federica Bianchini, and Knowledge Manager, Melanie Dawson-Jones, were able to get LibKey Nomad rolled out across the Trust early last year. They had gained support from senior colleagues and successfully submitted a business case to the IT Committee. Read more in their blog posts: “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/libkey-nomad-roll-out-process-at-bradford-district-care-nhs-trust/">LibKey Nomad - roll-out process at Bradford District Care NHS Trust</a>” and “<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.lksnorth.nhs.uk/blog/posts/libkey-nomad-closing-the-gap-with-document-supply-requests/">LibKey Nomad - closing the gap with document supply requests.</a>”</p>

          <h2><strong>Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Claire Bradley, Library Manager, started conversations to get LibKey Nomad rolled-out soon after the national access became available. Read her <a href="coventry-and-warwickshire---feedback-on-roll-out-of-libkey-nomad-to-all-trust-computers.odt">reflections</a>.</p>

          <h2><strong>Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</strong></h2>

          <p>Lisa Riddington and Claire O’Connor from the Library Team started their successful Trust-wide rollout by persuading the Medical Director and Head of IT about the money and time saving potential of Nomad, and the way it could contributing to the Trust’s strategic goals of increasing research activity.&nbsp; Read Lisa’s <a href="gloucestershire-hospitals-e-mail.odt">persuasive email</a>.</p>

          <p>We hope the stories above may inspire you to try to get Nomad rolled out in your organisation. Do let me know how you get on!</p>

          <p>If you are a follower of email lists, you might have seen a few requests recently for the search for data sets to support researchers. There is a new search trend developing and a need to improve data literacy.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>NHS Digital also hold a collection of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">National Data Sets</a>&nbsp;for things like community, commissioning, workforce, paediatric critical care, female genital mutilation.&nbsp; For a more international perspective check out&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://data.oecd.org/health.htm" target="_blank">WHO Data Collections</a> and the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://data.oecd.org/health.htm">Health Topic of OECD Data</a>.&nbsp;OECD also have the useful overview (<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance_19991312">Health at a glance 2021</a>) of international health indicators covering health status, risk factors, access to healthcare, quality outcomes, expenditure and workforce.</p>

          <p>For service data sets e.g. local GPs, dentists etc these are available through the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhs.uk/about-us/nhs-website-datasets/" target="_blank">NHS.UK Website</a>.&nbsp; For covid and use of technology, you might want to check out the datasets provided by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/nhsx-analytics-unit/dashboards-and-datasets/" target="_blank">NHS X</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          Inevitably in libraries we also have the back up of data which is held in the literature and in charity reports.&nbsp; Data mining is something which we need to consider doing to help plug some of the gaps in the official data sets.&nbsp; How else will we need to change search practice as research methodologies and technologies change?</p>

          <p>NHS Digital also hold a collection of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">National Data Sets</a>&nbsp;for things like community, commissioning, workforce, paediatric critical care, female genital mutilation.&nbsp; For a more international perspective check out&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://data.oecd.org/health.htm" target="_blank">WHO Data Collections</a> and the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://data.oecd.org/health.htm">Health Topic of OECD Data</a>.&nbsp;OECD also have the useful overview (<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance_19991312">Health at a glance 2021</a>) of international health indicators covering health status, risk factors, access to healthcare, quality outcomes, expenditure and workforce.</p>

          <p>For service data sets e.g. local GPs, dentists etc these are available through the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhs.uk/about-us/nhs-website-datasets/" target="_blank">NHS.UK Website</a>.&nbsp; For covid and use of technology, you might want to check out the datasets provided by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/nhsx-analytics-unit/dashboards-and-datasets/" target="_blank">NHS X</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Data can be generated from a wide range of sources.&nbsp; Google has now developed a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/" target="_blank">search engine</a>&nbsp;for data sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or for more unofficial lists, consider checking out&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#healthcare" target="_blank">GitHub list</a>, you will note that it also lists Medical Subject Headings as a data set and links to genomic data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          Inevitably in libraries we also have the back up of data which is held in the literature and in charity reports.&nbsp; Data mining is something which we need to consider doing to help plug some of the gaps in the official data sets.&nbsp; How else will we need to change search practice as research methodologies and technologies change?</p>

          <p>Ever been asked how to get copies of a clinical assessment tool survey, scale or measure? Due to the intellectual property and copyright typically associated with these, this can be rather a minefield.</p>

          <p>Fortunately the National Clinical Content Repository <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-clinical-content-repository-copyright-licensing-service/nccr-tools-and-measures-library">Tools and Measures Library</a> not only lists copyrighted clinical assessment tools and outcome measures for use within health and social care, but enables NHS and partner organisations to licence them for local use, including within Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.</p>

          <p>This service has been set up to encourage standardised data collection and reduce licensing costs. The provision of licences which permit EHR integration also helps reduce variation in the use of these tools in practice, thereby facilitating sharing and collation of outcomes data.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Your organisation will need to be registered with the service to use it. It is worth checking with your Trust’s Chief Information Officer to see if yours is already registered. If in doubt email <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="mailto:clin.licences@nhs.net">clin.licences@nhs.net</a>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Registration is straightforward – you complete a <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://healtheducationengland.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/LKS/Archive/Public%20document%20store/About/NHS+Digital+Sub-Licence+-+General+Terms+v1_3.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=Z2y9d3">Sub-Licence General Terms Agreement</a> to agree to the terms of the licence, and there is a nominal fee of £1 which is not charged.&nbsp; Once registered, you can complete the <a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-clinical-content-repository-copyright-licensing-service/request-for-content-licensing">Content Request Form</a>, to request permissions to re-use the tool you require.&nbsp; There are common sense rules about use and re-use of the tools.</p>

          <h2>In the North….</h2>

          <p>The North East LMS catalogue has been integrated into all local instances of the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub. There’s a little more fine-tuning to do, but so far, so good. Following information-sharing and demonstrations in the North West, service managers have been invited to indicate if they’d like to be included in the first phase of implementation of a shared LMS, and pre-implementation preparatory work will start in September. &nbsp;KLS staff in Yorkshire and Humber have been invited to join an initial information-sharing meeting next month.</p>

          <h2>In the Midlands and East….</h2>

          <p>The Health Libraries Midlands (HeLM) consortium launched in mid-April with services in Coventry and Warwickshire joining the existing BASE consortium using a shared Koha system. More services are set to join - HeLM will comprise 23 services (42 physical libraries) by the end of October 2022 – with Emily Johnson from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS FT continuing to manage expansion. The HeLM catalogue has been integrated with all members’ instances of the NHS Knowledge and Library Hub.</p>

          <p>The East of England’s Koha system went live in mid-May, and catalogue integration with local Hub instances will be rolled out shortly. The implementation project was ably managed by William Henderson from Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS FT, before his departure to work at UCL Cruciform Hub Library. Ian Rennie from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS FT is kindly providing system management support through the next period.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>In London….</h2>

          <p>South London libraries’ shared Koha consortium is gradually being scaled up. Three services joined in April, work to onboard three more commenced this month, and a further three set to join in the autumn. Doug Knock at Kings College London NHS FT has done a sterling job helping to oversee the work, and we are delighted that Sarah O'Reilly will next month be starting in the HEE-funded post of LMS Administrator.&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>In the South…</h2>

          <p>Kent, Surrey and Sussex libraries’ Koha system went live just a week after the East of England’s, at the end of May – quite a change for the region after over 16 years using the SirsiDynix software. The project has been managed by Rosy Bennett at the Royal Surrey NHS FT, working closely with system administrators Susan Merner and Michelle Onyett, as well as William and colleagues in the East.</p>

          <p>And last but of course not least, with the 5-year contract for the Axiell LMS used in the South West (the SWIMS system) ending in March 2024, work has started to review options for reprocurement.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In reviewing the range of development needs expressed in the 2021 Workforce Survey, we identified several areas where a range of resources are already available.&nbsp; To publicise these resources, we will be producing a series of short briefings. The first highlights some resources that may assist when preparing for a skills and capacity audit of your team. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>If there are any additional resources which you have found useful that we can share with others, please let us know <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk </a></p>

          <ol>
           <li><u>CILIP’s Professional Knowledge and Skills Base (PKSB)</u></li>
          </ol>

          <p style="margin-left:48px"><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.cilip.org.uk/page/PKSBvalue">CILIP’s PKSB</a> is a checklist of the broad range of skills and knowledge areas valuable in the library, knowledge and information sector.&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">In addition to being of value to plan personal development, the tool can be used by managers to inform role and service redesign, inform staff training, and in support of staff recruitment and retention.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:48px"><a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://youtu.be/QIuY3pDIpik">Watch a YouTube presentation</a> on how one manager made use of the tool to identify strengths and areas for skills development for their team.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">In addition to being available to all members via their CILIP login – NHS knowledge and library specialists in England can access both the tool and the Healthcare Sector Guide <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/learning-academy/professional-knowledge-and-skills-base">via Health Education England</a>.</p>

           <li><u>Staff Ratio Recommendations</u></li>
          </ol>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">Health Education England introduced the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/knowledge-and-library-services-policies/staff-ratio-policy">recommended staff ratio</a> of qualified knowledge and library specialists to healthcare staff due to the significant variation in this ratio across England leading to inequitable service provision.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">Managers may find it useful to compare their current staff ratio with the recommended levels.&nbsp; Some useful questions to consider:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How does the ratio of qualified knowledge and library staff to healthcare staff in my organisation compare with HEE’s recommendations?</li>
           <li>If the local ratio is lower, what additional services and developments might be possible with additional staffing?</li>
           <li>Are there opportunities to produce business cases and/or bid for funding for additional roles?</li>
           <li>Would the <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.nhs.uk/staff-learners-and-employers/resources-for-role-redesign/">Resources for Role Redesign</a> be helpful to inform any new or revised roles in the service?</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">&nbsp;</p>

          <ol start="3">
           <li><u>Case Studies from managers who have used the staff ratio</u></li>
          </ol>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">Health Education England has worked with knowledge and library service managers to explore ways in which the staff ratio recommendations have been used practically within their organisations.&nbsp; A <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/knowledge-and-library-services-policies/staff-ratio-policy/staff-ratio-policy-case-studies">range of case studies</a> have been developed covering these examples.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:48px">The guidance has been used to inform business cases for new embedded roles, and to inform service design, often alongside other HEE guidance and recommendations.</p>

          <p>Several discussions have taken place over the last couple of months about recruitment and how we attract people to apply for roles within NHS knowledge and library services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>From conversations with knowledge and library service managers, and awareness of the number of vacancies appearing on NHS Jobs, a short survey was distributed to managers in January 2022 to assess some of the difficulties with recruitment.&nbsp; 64 responses were received and results confirmed that many managers were experiencing challenges with recruitment.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In March 2022 Kaye Bagshaw and Nicki Forgham-Healey ran a series of focus groups with nineteen library managers to find out more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneously, Sarah Gardner, assisted by Sarah Hennessy, facilitated a virtual knowledge café for library staff in the Yorkshire and Humber Library Network to discuss recruitment and research topics.&nbsp; The useful feedback from this café and from discussions at an East Midlands Clinical Information Specialists Network meeting was shared at a joint Workforce and Research Round Table event held in May.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      /hee:contentBlocks[2]:
        jcr:primaryType: hippostd:html
        hippostd:content: |-
          <p>Several themes and suggestions emerged from the various discussions and feedback:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>raising the profile&nbsp; of working in the health sector&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>job descriptions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

           <li>
           <p>advertising vacancies&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>the role of qualifications&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>developing the workforce&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Recent experience of finding the right candidate for job vacancies were shared and one of the key themes which emerged was the sense that the pandemic has had a negative influence on application numbers. Several reasons for this were discussed, including potential candidates not being interested in working in the NHS, being unaware of what a library and knowledge specialist in the NHS does and preferences around full time or part time and virtual or hybrid positions not being able to be met.&nbsp; Higher living costs associated with certain geographical areas was also considered to be a factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Raising the profile&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>All agreed that promotion of our sector is a key area to develop, as it was felt that not enough is known about the roles knowledge and library staff undertake to support patient care and ensure best evidence is used to underpin decision making in healthcare settings. It was interesting to listen to the groups, as they all believed that they make a difference to patient outcomes in their daily working lives. Several people spoke about the opportunity to work with so many dedicated people as a source of job satisfaction, others went so far as to say being able to support clinical staff was a privilege.&nbsp; One NHS trust had run a marketing campaign where “hidden roles” in the health service were showcased, one of which was from the knowledge and library service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We heard about various other ways in which library managers were championing the role of their services in the NHS these included:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>talking about the work they do with students on university library courses&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>visiting schools and promoting the role of librarians in the NHS&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>attending careers fairs&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>offering work experience and visits to library students or librarians from other sectors&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>At the round-table event it was agreed that positive role modelling has a significant part to play in raising the profile and changing perceptions about our profession.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Job descriptions&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>There was a lot of discussion about job descriptions. It was felt that the terminology used in job descriptions and adverts can be off-putting and unintentionally non-inclusive.&nbsp; Some managers wondered if candidates realised that new starters are not necessarily expected to have all the skills listed as desirable (or even essential) on job descriptions. They wondered if it might be possible to add a sentence to job profiles stating that successful candidates would be given the opportunity to acquire all the required skills and knowledge during an agreed period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Some managers had noticed disparities in relation to job titles, key responsibilities and banding in advertised roles.&nbsp; Greater awareness of the Agenda For Change National Job Profiles and how they are applied was deemed to be useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Advertising Vacancies&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>There were a variety of views about the best way to advertise vacancies.&nbsp; Many felt that NHS Jobs had limited scope but recognised that this is often the only formally available place where an advert can be placed.&nbsp; There had been some limited use of CILIP Information Professional Jobs but it was generally agreed that this is a rather expensive option.&nbsp; Advertising via social media or social networks was often a more viable alternative.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Emphasising career progression and continuing professional development opportunities alongside attractive conditions and clarity about pay was thought to be important.&nbsp;</p>

        hippostd:content: |-
          <h3>Qualifications and Experience&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>For qualified roles, managers reported a lack of suitable candidates with the relevant health sector experience. The importance of NHS experience was discussed, and many managers wanted new starters at band 6 to be able to “hit the ground running”.&nbsp; Within the knowledge café this led to discussion about routes into the profession, the need for placements within health libraries to be offered to library and information studies students and the need for planned role development and progression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Discussions around what makes a suitable candidate led to agreement that transferable skills are key for all roles, highlighting customer service and enthusiasm for the role. It was felt that skills such as literature searching, teaching, and use of medical terminology could be learnt on the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      /hee:contentBlocks[7]:
        jcr:primaryType: hippostd:html
        hippostd:content: |-
          <h3>Developing the workforce&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>The need to develop existing staff was raised, and feedback ranged from encouraging paraprofessionals at bands 3 or 4 to undertake a suitable qualification to introducing developmental two-year posts for library and information graduates at a band 5.&nbsp; It was felt important to advertise these types of roles at the right time of year to attract library and information students who are about to graduate. There was support for the Library Assistant Apprenticeship Scheme and development of the degree-level apprenticeship was welcomed.&nbsp; There was consensus that there needs to be a plan for role development with clear progression opportunities and clarity about role responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Some managers wondered if potential candidates working outside the NHS might be able to access relevant training via the Knowledge for Healthcare Learning Academy, or whether guidance could be produced to assist those thinking about applying for a role in healthcare.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have undertaken some analysis of our current workforce data and are using this to model the future development needs of our small and specialised workforce.&nbsp; From our data we know that we need to grow our workforce.&nbsp; As one part of this we have offered bursaries for members of our workforce who wish to study for a library and information postgraduate qualification and we are actively seeking ways to develop a graduate trainee scheme.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We are also broadening our continuing professional development offer to map the unique skills and knowledge required to work within NHS knowledge and library services and ensure that we have a consistent offer available to upskill those that join our workforce.&nbsp; This primarily focuses upon extending expert searcher development opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There is however, much more to do.&nbsp; We are currently establishing a recruitment task and finish group to explore some of the following questions that have emerged from this early work:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What good practice can be shared around recruitment practices?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>How can job descriptions and job adverts be made more inclusive to appeal to a wider audience?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What is the best way to advertise a vacancy?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What can we learn from how are other sectors or professions managing to recruit people to their vacancies?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>How can the job application and candidate selection process be improved?&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Job descriptions&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>There was a lot of discussion about job descriptions. It was felt that the terminology used in job descriptions and adverts can be off-putting and unintentionally non-inclusive.&nbsp; Some managers wondered if candidates realised that new starters are not necessarily expected to have all the skills listed as desirable (or even essential) on job descriptions. They wondered if it might be possible to add a sentence to job profiles stating that successful candidates would be given the opportunity to acquire all the required skills and knowledge during an agreed period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Some managers had noticed disparities in relation to job titles, key responsibilities and banding in advertised roles.&nbsp; Greater awareness of the Agenda For Change National Job Profiles and how they are applied was deemed to be useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Advertising Vacancies&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>There were a variety of views about the best way to advertise vacancies.&nbsp; Many felt that NHS Jobs had limited scope but recognised that this is often the only formally available place where an advert can be placed.&nbsp; There had been some limited use of CILIP Information Professional Jobs but it was generally agreed that this is a rather expensive option.&nbsp; Advertising via social media or social networks was often a more viable alternative.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Emphasising career progression and continuing professional development opportunities alongside attractive conditions and clarity about pay was thought to be important.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Qualifications and Experience&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>For qualified roles, managers reported a lack of suitable candidates with the relevant health sector experience. The importance of NHS experience was discussed, and many managers wanted new starters at band 6 to be able to “hit the ground running”.&nbsp; Within the knowledge café this led to discussion about routes into the profession, the need for placements within health libraries to be offered to library and information studies students and the need for planned role development and progression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Discussions around what makes a suitable candidate led to agreement that transferable skills are key for all roles, highlighting customer service and enthusiasm for the role. It was felt that skills such as literature searching, teaching, and use of medical terminology could be learnt on the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Developing the workforce&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>The need to develop existing staff was raised, and feedback ranged from encouraging paraprofessionals at bands 3 or 4 to undertake a suitable qualification to introducing developmental two-year posts for library and information graduates at a band 5.&nbsp; It was felt important to advertise these types of roles at the right time of year to attract library and information students who are about to graduate. There was support for the Library Assistant Apprenticeship Scheme and development of the degree-level apprenticeship was welcomed.&nbsp; There was consensus that there needs to be a plan for role development with clear progression opportunities and clarity about role responsibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Some managers wondered if potential candidates working outside the NHS might be able to access relevant training via the Knowledge for Healthcare Learning Academy, or whether guidance could be produced to assist those thinking about applying for a role in healthcare.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We have undertaken some analysis of our current workforce data and are using this to model the future development needs of our small and specialised workforce.&nbsp; From our data we know that we need to grow our workforce.&nbsp; As one part of this we have offered bursaries for members of our workforce who wish to study for a library and information postgraduate qualification and we are actively seeking ways to develop a graduate trainee scheme.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We are also broadening our continuing professional development offer to map the unique skills and knowledge required to work within NHS knowledge and library services and ensure that we have a consistent offer available to upskill those that join our workforce.&nbsp; This primarily focuses upon extending expert searcher development opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>There is however, much more to do.&nbsp; We are currently establishing a recruitment task and finish group to explore some of the following questions that have emerged from this early work:&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What good practice can be shared around recruitment practices?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>How can job descriptions and job adverts be made more inclusive to appeal to a wider audience?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What is the best way to advertise a vacancy?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What can we learn from how are other sectors or professions managing to recruit people to their vacancies?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>How can the job application and candidate selection process be improved?&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Several discussions have taken place over the last couple of months about recruitment and how we attract people to apply for roles within NHS knowledge and library services.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>From conversations with knowledge and library service managers, and awareness of the number of vacancies appearing on NHS Jobs, a short survey was distributed to managers in January 2022 to assess some of the difficulties with recruitment.&nbsp; 64 responses were received and results confirmed that many managers were experiencing challenges with recruitment.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In March 2022 Kaye Bagshaw and Nicki Forgham-Healey ran a series of focus groups with nineteen library managers to find out more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simultaneously, Sarah Gardner, assisted by Sarah Hennessy, facilitated a virtual knowledge café for library staff in the Yorkshire and Humber Library Network to discuss recruitment and research topics.&nbsp; The useful feedback from this café and from discussions at an East Midlands Clinical Information Specialists Network meeting was shared at a joint Workforce and Research Round Table event held in May.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      /hee:contentBlocks[2]:
        jcr:primaryType: hippostd:html
        hippostd:content: |-
          <p>Several themes and suggestions emerged from the various discussions and feedback:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>raising the profile&nbsp; of working in the health sector&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>job descriptions&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>advertising vacancies&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>the role of qualifications&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>developing the workforce&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Recent experience of finding the right candidate for job vacancies were shared and one of the key themes which emerged was the sense that the pandemic has had a negative influence on application numbers. Several reasons for this were discussed, including potential candidates not being interested in working in the NHS, being unaware of what a library and knowledge specialist in the NHS does and preferences around full time or part time and virtual or hybrid positions not being able to be met.&nbsp; Higher living costs associated with certain geographical areas was also considered to be a factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Raising the profile&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>All agreed that promotion of our sector is a key area to develop, as it was felt that not enough is known about the roles knowledge and library staff undertake to support patient care and ensure best evidence is used to underpin decision making in healthcare settings. It was interesting to listen to the groups, as they all believed that they make a difference to patient outcomes in their daily working lives. Several people spoke about the opportunity to work with so many dedicated people as a source of job satisfaction, others went so far as to say being able to support clinical staff was a privilege.&nbsp; One NHS trust had run a marketing campaign where “hidden roles” in the health service were showcased, one of which was from the knowledge and library service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We heard about various other ways in which library managers were championing the role of their services in the NHS these included:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>talking about the work they do with students on university library courses&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>visiting schools and promoting the role of librarians in the NHS&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>attending careers fairs&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>offering work experience and visits to library students or librarians from other sectors&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>At the round-table event it was agreed that positive role modelling has a significant part to play in raising the profile and changing perceptions about our profession.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>What and how we planned and what we did</strong></p>

          <p>Health Information Week is part of the&nbsp;Royal Devon University Healthcare Knowledge and Library Northern services&nbsp;(Royal Devon North KLS) marketing, outreach and promotion strategy and an ideal opportunity for partnership working with the public library services in Devon was identified.</p>

          <p>Project meetings were held in person every few months with senior library supervisors and regular email contact for project updates and communication took place.</p>

          <p>A plan was agreed that we would approach members of One Barnstaple Network to see if they would like to participate in a week of activity hosted by Barnstaple Library. The Librarian is part of the One Barnstaple network and used contacts, membership meetings and Groop to communicate the opportunity to take part to One Barnstaple member organisations. One Barnstaple website:&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/G4sCCkrNQhAYg60UJc0tY?domain=onebarnstaple.org.uk/">https://onebarnstaple.org.uk/</a>&nbsp;One Barnstaple works to connect the community and towards&nbsp;“Better health, economic prosperity and high-quality living environment for Barnstaple residents”</p>

          <p>A multi-channel promotion strategy was planned to use social media promotion on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, Royal Devon North KLS website with specially created pages, pages in the Royal Devon North KLS regular monthly Newsletter, print media and notice boards and book/stock displays. We also added a themed resource area of 'Menopause' in response to community feedback in addition to the other themed resource areas already selected.</p>

          <p>Barnstaple Library planned to use social media assets, logos and website material provided by Royal Devon North KLS and advertise via their established promotion networks.</p>

          <p>Activities also planned to take part throughout the week in addition to the invited stall holders were: Information and resource sheets, Information display, Interactive games, Discussions with library staff, Book displays with health and wellbeing support, a rolling presentation of public library resources, services and events, and Smoothie Bike activity.

          <p><strong>Impact and feedback</strong></p>

          <p>The public library space acts as a place to connect and to just be for people where they feel comfortable and can see friendly faces. The library is a trusted place to access good quality information and seek support from staff and other trusted providers of information. They were an ideal partner to work with on this project as they are used to working in partnership with a variety of organisations and were very open to inviting people in to their library to deliver this activity. There was alraedy an exisiting relationship with the public library service but I would say approach your local public library and find out what opportunities that might be.</p>

          <p>One Barnstaple was an ideally placed network to reach organisations that work within the health sector supporting the public with their health and health information. The network also has a health inequalities arm that perfectly fits with the library's offer around health literacy training and information as GPs and other health professionals are part of One Barnstaple and the wider One Northern Devon network.</p>

          <p>The week was really good to be able to approach and informally chat to people about their health informally. The resources around the topic areas provided a starting point to have a conversation about health matters and talk about issues affecting them as individuals.</p>

          <p>There was no in-depth demand from anyone attending for detailed medical information it was all very informal and much more about signposting to reliable sources of information and general discussions around health and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>You can read more about snapshots of interactions in our report :&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/LBmTCl2NQumOL5KCYYftI?domain=northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/">https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/library/health-information-week-2022/</a></p>

          <p>The organisations that took part and had a stall for the day all responded to say how much they had enjoyed being a part of the activity and felt that it was worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Recovery Devon representative: 'The interactions I had were quite meaningful. I think that is what these kind of events are about - not how many people that stop by to chat, but how just one conversation can change someone's day or maybe even their life.'<br />
          Vista Wellbeing: 'High blood pressure can lead to a heart attack or stroke, and the symptoms can go undetected, so it’s important to know what yours is. Of the 15 people we checked, two had high readings that they were unaware of. We have recommended that they have further checks at their GP practice. It is important to note that a single high measurement does not lead to a diagnosis of hypertension or treatment, and a health professional will usually want to monitor it over time.'</p>

          <p>You can read more in our report:&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/LBmTCl2NQumOL5KCYYftI?domain=northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/">https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/library/health-information-week-2022/</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We also monitored our social media and website interaction stats and found that the 'Menopause' social media posts were in the top 3 posts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>

          <p>You can find more detail on these stats in our report:&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/LBmTCl2NQumOL5KCYYftI?domain=northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/">https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/library/health-information-week-2022/</a></p>

          <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>

          <p>What worked well:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>the partnership working and communication with the different organisations and One Barnstaple worked well</li>
           <li>a prominent location in library foyer for the activity with good book displays and rolling display the library created</li>
           <li>good opportunities to talk to people informally about health information - the library is a trusted provider of information and the initiative about reliable health information fit well</li>
           <li>nice atmosphere that felt comfortable for people to talk</li>
           <li>the request to add the health subject 'Menopause' to the themes worked well as that was one of the most popular website pages and social media posts</li>
           <li>resource sheets and themes were good</li>
           <li>people responded to the interactive element of the display well; and</li>
           <li>the quality of interaction with people was good, people who stopped spent time talking. It felt like they took away something for the interaction.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Even better if:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>there could have been more footfall</li>
           <li>more prominent promotion of the week's activity in the library during the week</li>
           <li>if circumstances and staffing had allowed it would have been good to attend some of the library group events in the afternoon and talk to them all</li>
           <li>there could have been more interactive activity as part of the display as the response was good to the interactivity that there was</li>
           <li>there had been more assets for public library to use to advertise activity during the week; and</li>
           <li>there could have been more time to talk to people in depth but as one stall holder said in feedback that, '<strong>One conversation can change someone's day or maybe even their life.</strong>'</li>

          <p>Health Information Week is part of the&nbsp;Royal Devon University Healthcare Knowledge and Library Northern services&nbsp;(Royal Devon North KLS) marketing, outreach and promotion strategy and an ideal opportunity for partnership working with the public library services in Devon was identified.</p>

          <p>Project meetings were held in person every few months with senior library supervisors and regular email contact for project updates and communication took place.</p>

          <p>A plan was agreed that we would approach members of One Barnstaple Network to see if they would like to participate in a week of activity hosted by Barnstaple Library. The Librarian is part of the One Barnstaple network and used contacts, membership meetings and Groop to communicate the opportunity to take part to One Barnstaple member organisations. One Barnstaple website:&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/G4sCCkrNQhAYg60UJc0tY?domain=onebarnstaple.org.uk/">https://onebarnstaple.org.uk/</a>&nbsp;One Barnstaple works to connect the community and towards&nbsp;“Better health, economic prosperity and high-quality living environment for Barnstaple residents”</p>

          <p>A multi-channel promotion strategy was planned to use social media promotion on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, Royal Devon North KLS website with specially created pages, pages in the Royal Devon North KLS regular monthly Newsletter, print media and notice boards and book/stock displays. We also added a themed resource area of 'Menopause' in response to community feedback in addition to the other themed resource areas already selected.</p>

          <p>Barnstaple Library planned to use social media assets, logos and website material provided by Royal Devon North KLS and advertise via their established promotion networks.</p>

          <p>Activities also planned to take part throughout the week in addition to the invited stall holders were: Information and resource sheets, Information display, Interactive games, Discussions with library staff, Book displays with health and wellbeing support, a rolling presentation of public library resources, services and events, and Smoothie Bike activity.

          <p><strong>Impact and feedback</strong></p>

          <p>The public library space acts as a place to connect and to just be for people where they feel comfortable and can see friendly faces. The library is a trusted place to access good quality information and seek support from staff and other trusted providers of information. They were an ideal partner to work with on this project as they are used to working in partnership with a variety of organisations and were very open to inviting people in to their library to deliver this activity. There was alraedy an exisiting relationship with the public library service but I would say approach your local public library and find out what opportunities that might be.</p>

          <p>One Barnstaple was an ideally placed network to reach organisations that work within the health sector supporting the public with their health and health information. The network also has a health inequalities arm that perfectly fits with the library's offer around health literacy training and information as GPs and other health professionals are part of One Barnstaple and the wider One Northern Devon network.</p>

          <p>The week was really good to be able to approach and informally chat to people about their health informally. The resources around the topic areas provided a starting point to have a conversation about health matters and talk about issues affecting them as individuals.</p>

          <p>There was no in-depth demand from anyone attending for detailed medical information it was all very informal and much more about signposting to reliable sources of information and general discussions around health and wellbeing.</p>

          <p>You can read more about snapshots of interactions in our report :&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/LBmTCl2NQumOL5KCYYftI?domain=northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/">https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/library/health-information-week-2022/</a></p>

          <p>The organisations that took part and had a stall for the day all responded to say how much they had enjoyed being a part of the activity and felt that it was worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Recovery Devon representative: 'The interactions I had were quite meaningful. I think that is what these kind of events are about - not how many people that stop by to chat, but how just one conversation can change someone's day or maybe even their life.'<br />
          Vista Wellbeing: 'High blood pressure can lead to a heart attack or stroke, and the symptoms can go undetected, so it’s important to know what yours is. Of the 15 people we checked, two had high readings that they were unaware of. We have recommended that they have further checks at their GP practice. It is important to note that a single high measurement does not lead to a diagnosis of hypertension or treatment, and a health professional will usually want to monitor it over time.'</p>

          <p>You can read more in our report:&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/LBmTCl2NQumOL5KCYYftI?domain=northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/">https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/library/health-information-week-2022/</a>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>We also monitored our social media and website interaction stats and found that the 'Menopause' social media posts were in the top 3 posts across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.</p>

          <p>You can find more detail on these stats in our report:&nbsp;<a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/LBmTCl2NQumOL5KCYYftI?domain=northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/">https://www.northdevonhealth.nhs.uk/library/health-information-week-2022/</a></p>

          <p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>

          <p>What worked well:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>the partnership working and communication with the different organisations and One Barnstaple worked well</li>
           <li>a prominent location in library foyer for the activity with good book displays and rolling display the library created</li>
           <li>good opportunities to talk to people informally about health information - the library is a trusted provider of information and the initiative about reliable health information fit well</li>
           <li>nice atmosphere that felt comfortable for people to talk</li>
           <li>the request to add the health subject 'Menopause' to the themes worked well as that was one of the most popular website pages and social media posts</li>
           <li>resource sheets and themes were good</li>
           <li>people responded to the interactive element of the display well; and</li>
           <li>the quality of interaction with people was good, people who stopped spent time talking. It felt like they took away something for the interaction.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Even better if:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>there could have been more footfall</li>
           <li>more prominent promotion of the week's activity in the library during the week</li>
           <li>if circumstances and staffing had allowed it would have been good to attend some of the library group events in the afternoon and talk to them all</li>
           <li>there could have been more interactive activity as part of the display as the response was good to the interactivity that there was</li>
           <li>there had been more assets for public library to use to advertise activity during the week; and</li>
           <li>there could have been more time to talk to people in depth but as one stall holder said in feedback that, '<strong>One conversation can change someone's day or maybe even their life.</strong>'</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A phenomenal amount of LMS-related work has taken place in different regions over the last 12 months. Libraries in the East of England and Kent, Surrey &amp; Sussex completed a migration to Koha from SirsiDynix, and there were phased expansions of the shared Koha consortia in both the Midlands and London.</p>

          <p>After Action Reviews for KLS staff have been held in three of these regions, with the aim of capturing actionable learning for HEE, for PTFS Europe as supplier, and for KLS teams involved in upcoming implementation and expansion projects.</p>

          <h2>Key messages for HEE and PTFS</h2>

          <p>The key messages and recommendations for HEE and PTFS emerging from the reviews are:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Consider the timing of LMS projects in relation to other changes taking place; with the implementation of the NHS Knowledge Hub and the closure of HDAS also taking place during the last 12 months, services involved in these projects had a lot to contend with</li>
           <li>Get dedicated project management support in place in good time</li>
           <li>Ensure sufficient supplier-side capacity, especially when projects are taking place in parallel</li>
           <li>Allow longer for the planning and testing phases to give KLS teams sufficient time to do the necessary work around their other commitments</li>
           <li>Ensure that key documents such as template terms of reference and GDPR guidance are available at the outset. To date these have tended to be developed iteratively, based on learning in each region (the regions going last will undoubtedly benefit!</li>
           <li>Be realistic about system limitations and beware of over-promising: it is for good reason that digital projects should focus first on the ‘minimum viable product’ <em>then</em> tackle enhancements</li>
           <li>Help all parties avoid ‘scope creep’: implementation of a new shared system is a good opportunity to review existing practice, but resist trying to address all related issues</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>Ensure training is appropriately tailored and not overly technical</li>
           <li>Provide more support for smaller services and those which for whatever reason have not engaged or become disengaged</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>Ensure that all KLS managers receive regular updates via managers' meetings</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key messages for KLS colleagues</h2>

          <p>The key messages for KLS colleagues embarking on similar LMS projects are:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>You will have to invest time participating in meetings and groups and doing testing.&nbsp; Consider this in the context of other demands and priorities</li>
           <li>Specialist working groups (e.g. for circulation, cataloguing, etc.) work well for discussion and decision-making: get involved – or get members of your team involved - where you can, but also trust group members to make informed recommendations which reflect the needs of all</li>
           <li>Don’t forget the bigger picture!</li>
           <li>Read the lessons learned from other projects!</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On the basis of these recommendations, HEE and PTFS have made adjustments for upcoming projects, which include further extension of the Midlands and London consortia, and phased implementations in the North West&nbsp;and in Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

           <li>Consider the timing of LMS projects in relation to other changes taking place; with the implementation of the NHS Knowledge Hub and the closure of HDAS also taking place during the last 12 months, services involved in these projects had a lot to contend with</li>
           <li>Get dedicated project management support in place in good time</li>
           <li>Ensure sufficient supplier-side capacity, especially when projects are taking place in parallel</li>
           <li>Allow longer for the planning and testing phases to give KLS teams sufficient time to do the necessary work around their other commitments</li>
           <li>Ensure that key documents such as template terms of reference and GDPR guidance are available at the outset. To date these have tended to be developed iteratively, based on learning in each region (the regions going last will undoubtedly benefit!</li>
           <li>Be realistic about system limitations and beware of over-promising: it is for good reason that digital projects should focus first on the ‘minimum viable product’ <em>then</em> tackle enhancements</li>
           <li>Help all parties avoid ‘scope creep’: implementation of a new shared system is a good opportunity to review existing practice, but resist trying to address all related issues</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>Ensure training is appropriately tailored and not overly technical</li>
           <li>Provide more support for smaller services and those which for whatever reason have not engaged or become disengaged</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>Ensure that all KLS managers receive regular updates via managers' meetings</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key messages for KLS colleagues</h2>

          <p>The key messages for KLS colleagues embarking on similar LMS projects are:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>You will have to invest time participating in meetings and groups and doing testing.&nbsp; Consider this in the context of other demands and priorities</li>
           <li>Specialist working groups (e.g. for circulation, cataloguing, etc.) work well for discussion and decision-making: get involved – or get members of your team involved - where you can, but also trust group members to make informed recommendations which reflect the needs of all</li>
           <li>Don’t forget the bigger picture!</li>
           <li>Read the lessons learned from other projects!</li>
          </ul>

          <p>On the basis of these recommendations, HEE and PTFS have made adjustments for upcoming projects, which include further extension of the Midlands and London consortia, and phased implementations in the North West&nbsp;and in Yorkshire and the Humber.</p>

        and time to think about the important work knowledge and library specialists
        do to mobilise evidence and knowledge.  We reiterate the need for evidence
        from research to be used to underpin all healthcare decision making.  We also
        highlight the need to use learning from good practice and encourage ‘know-how’
        and organisational knowledge to be shared and used, to inform improved care
        outcomes.   This year the theme for #KNOWvmber22 is Sharing Knowledge – Breaking
        Down the Barriers and our focus is on how knowledge and library specialists
        contribute to sharing knowledge.'

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px">During the first week of October we were glad to be able to welcome members of the ThirdIron team to the UK to deliver a series of sessions on all things <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cm6o5f9huq1wr4y/2022%20NHS%20Training.pptx?dl=0">LibKey, Browzine and Nomad</a>.&nbsp; It was great to see so many people in person and at the online session with people sharing their progress and finding out more about options. This post follows up with some of the things that were discussed and some frequently asked questions.</p>

          <p>As a reminder this is the suite of resources that HEE procure from <a href="https://thirdiron.com/">Third Iron</a> for the NHS in England (all populated with holdings data within the EBSCO link resolver, HLM):</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>LibKey Nomad was a particular focus for discussion.&nbsp; Many libraries reported making progress with their IT Departments on installing Nomad across machines in the Trust.&nbsp; Search <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/search?term=nomad">“Nomad” on the Service Desk</a> to find the up to date support documentation on this process. &nbsp;We will continue to update the <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000035749">briefing to IT departments.</a></p>

          <p>We previously featured <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/libkey-nomad-for-the-nhs-in-england-discover-your-content-through-the-open-web">a number of case studies</a> of library teams getting Nomad rolled out.&nbsp; Last month Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust saw Nomad enable a leap of 400% in their LibKey downloads following Trust wide installation. ThirdIron shared a nicely presented <a href="https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/NHS-Chesterfield-Case-Study-Apr-2021.pdf">case study</a> of Chesterfield Royal Hospital deploying Nomad and seeing similar rises.</p>

          <p>I am sure I was not alone in being tickled to watch Nomad populating links on the fly into Wikipedia and PubMed pages.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px">During the first week of October we were glad to be able to welcome members of the ThirdIron team to the UK to deliver a series of sessions on all things <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/cm6o5f9huq1wr4y/2022%20NHS%20Training.pptx?dl=0">LibKey, Browzine and Nomad</a>.&nbsp; It was great to see so many people in person and at the online session with people sharing their progress and finding out more about options. This post follows up with some of the things that were discussed and some frequently asked questions.</p>

          <p>As a reminder this is the suite of resources that HEE procure from <a href="https://thirdiron.com/">Third Iron</a> for the NHS in England (all populated with holdings data within the EBSCO link resolver, HLM):</p>

          <p><a href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-discovery/">LibKey Discovery</a>: one-click access to PDF articles from the Knowledge and Library Hub</p>

          <p><a href="https://thirdiron.com/products/browzine/">BrowZine Web</a>: Browse Journals on the Hub or directly with a clear display format offering the same one-click links to both national and locally purchased content. You can also <a href="https://thirdiron.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BrowZineAPIDocs/pages/66158784/External+Search+API">embed</a> a search box in your website like <a href="https://www.nsftlibrary.nhs.uk/journals/">Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-link/">LibKey Link:</a> one-click access to PDFs or an ILL request form when full text is not available from a wide range of databases.&nbsp; This has been incorporated into all core content databases, as well as <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000054511">Google Scholar</a> (which automatically picks up your Library if you have Nomad installed).&nbsp; Setting it up as part of the Outside tool for <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000039271">PubMed</a> was a theme during the sessions with not everyone having completed this task.&nbsp; PubMed is popular with many users so do consider registering.&nbsp; There is a <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000039271">tailored guide</a> available and the Service Desk are here to help.</p>

          <p><a href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-io/">LibKey.io:</a> simple DOI and PubMed ID look up against your library’s subscribed and open access resources.&nbsp; We are working with ThirdIron to create a requesting tool for interlibrary article sharing based on this tool.</p>

          <p><a href="https://thirdiron.com/products/libkey-nomad/">LibKey Nomad:</a> browser extension that provides one-click link to your full-text content when users are searching the open web, e.g., Google, Wikipedia or publishers websites.&nbsp; An ILL form is offered when full-text is not available.&nbsp; Now available for Chrome, Edge and Safari browsers (mobile browsers are not compatible).</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>LibKey Nomad was a particular focus for discussion.&nbsp; Many libraries reported making progress with their IT Departments on installing Nomad across machines in the Trust.&nbsp; Search <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/search?term=nomad">“Nomad” on the Service Desk</a> to find the up to date support documentation on this process. &nbsp;We will continue to update the <a href="https://support.library.hee.nhs.uk/support/solutions/articles/27000035749">briefing to IT departments.</a></p>

          <p>We previously featured <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/blogs/libkey-nomad-for-the-nhs-in-england-discover-your-content-through-the-open-web">a number of case studies</a> of library teams getting Nomad rolled out.&nbsp; Last month Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust saw Nomad enable a leap of 400% in their LibKey downloads following Trust wide installation. ThirdIron shared a nicely presented <a href="https://thirdiron-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/webassets/NHS-Chesterfield-Case-Study-Apr-2021.pdf">case study</a> of Chesterfield Royal Hospital deploying Nomad and seeing similar rises.</p>

          <p>I am sure I was not alone in being tickled to watch Nomad populating links on the fly into Wikipedia and PubMed pages.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px">Browser plugins like Nomad are likely to be a new concept for many users so they do need promotion.&nbsp; ThirdIron have created <a href="https://thirdiron.com/success-guide/hospital-libraries/#product-specific">promotional resources</a> including a two page guide, brief video and social media content.&nbsp; Word of mouth is powerful and we suggest targeting demos at potential heavy users who can spread the word.&nbsp; With many users having Apple products at home the recent launch of a Safari plugin is another opportunity to target a time where people might do more of their research (and have more control over their IT experience).</p>

          <p>There were questions about the potential for privacy issues.&nbsp; Nomad records which Library you belong to (click on the Plugin icon to swiftly change between libraries if you have more than one) but does not store any login details.&nbsp; By knowing which library you are aligned with it knows which content to show you.&nbsp; Open Access articles are offered first and where subscription content is available the user is then taken via OpenAthens.&nbsp; A Data Protection Impact Assessment is not required – contact us for details of assurance.</p>

          <p>With Nomad preferring PDF articles there were questions about when you wanted access to the HTML version instead.&nbsp; In this instance you can take the DoI and search on the <a href="https://library.nhs.uk/knowledgehub">Knowledge &amp; Library Hub</a> or <a href="http://LibKey.io">LibKey.io</a> where you will be given the choice if available.</p>

          <p>Always happy to hear about successes and consider how to address blockages around getting this great tool into the virtual hands of our users.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px">This blog post will discuss how the Knowledge and Library Service, at the newly-merged organisation of University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, created a knowledge asset to merge two library services’ procedure manuals. This was done to share information about how the two libraries were run, and act as a quick reference guide as to how procedures were dealt with on two different service sites. The latter was especially important for staff who had to work across both sites. It also expanded as a method of capturing knowledge when staff left the organisation.</p>

          <h2>What is a knowledge asset?</h2>

          <p>Knowledge assets capture knowledge and experience in one place to be of maximum use to people who could benefit from that learning in the future. They can contain a variety of information such as key lessons learnt, case histories, key contacts, and best practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">Why did we create this resource?</h2>

          <p>In April 2020, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust was formed, the result of a merger between a district general hospital and larger teaching hospital in southwest England.. Each organisation had a separate knowledge and library service which, as part of merger, needed to become a single service.&nbsp; As part of this merger work, library procedures from each service needed review and integration into a single procedure manual.&nbsp; Alongside this work there was also a need to capture the knowledge of staff who were leaving. Discussions sessions were held with the aim of streamlining process whilst recognising the need for separate procedures which were site specific. It was agreed to create a knowledge asset with the &nbsp;following functions:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Searchable</li>
           <li>Accessible</li>
           <li>Easily added to</li>
           <li>Able to distinguish between the two sites</li>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">Solution</h2>

          <p>North Somerset Healthcare Library based at Weston General Hospital had access to LibGuides, and as part of this subscription LibAnswers. This function allowed us to set up a secure area in which we could create an electronic procedure manual for both sites. The procedure manual was written in a form of Questions and Answers, these ranged from:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How should I report a printer fault?</li>
           <li>How do I access/use SPSS software onsite?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Site-specific answers were labelled according to their location, to enable colleagues to find the right information quickly and easily. Following discussions with the whole team we asked what information they would find useful to know about if they were working on the new site. So, this included information about key contacts, telephone numbers. Alongside this we also reviewed the information which was in the two procedures manuals and added this information in the form of questions.</p>

This meant that it was easy to search for information based on location.

          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">Making use of the knowledge asset – Lessons Learnt.</h3>

          <p>Since its creation, the FAQs database has been updated and amended as staff have left or roles have changed. The role-specific knowledge and information added to the asset by leavers has helped to mitigate against the loss of essential organisational knowledge, and avoided duplication of work. The database is easy to use, add to, and access and is utilised by all of the team. It supports hybrid and cross-site working but it is particularly useful for new members of staff or colleagues who are taking on new roles.</p>

          <p>Adopting the use of this database has saved time for library staff, which can then be devoted to our users. Once staff are trained in its use, they can quickly access information about processes and procedures allowing them to respond to queries and find solutions to common issues and problems.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px">This blog post will discuss how the Knowledge and Library Service, at the newly-merged organisation of University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, created a knowledge asset to merge two library services’ procedure manuals. This was done to share information about how the two libraries were run, and act as a quick reference guide as to how procedures were dealt with on two different service sites. The latter was especially important for staff who had to work across both sites. It also expanded as a method of capturing knowledge when staff left the organisation.</p>

          <h2>What is a knowledge asset?</h2>

          <p>Knowledge assets capture knowledge and experience in one place to be of maximum use to people who could benefit from that learning in the future. They can contain a variety of information such as key lessons learnt, case histories, key contacts, and best practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">Why did we create this resource?</h2>

          <p>In April 2020, University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust was formed, the result of a merger between a district general hospital and larger teaching hospital in southwest England.. Each organisation had a separate knowledge and library service which, as part of merger, needed to become a single service.&nbsp; As part of this merger work, library procedures from each service needed review and integration into a single procedure manual.&nbsp; Alongside this work there was also a need to capture the knowledge of staff who were leaving. Discussions sessions were held with the aim of streamlining process whilst recognising the need for separate procedures which were site specific. It was agreed to create a knowledge asset with the &nbsp;following functions:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Searchable</li>
           <li>Accessible</li>
           <li>Easily added to</li>
           <li>Able to distinguish between the two sites</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">Solution</h2>

          <p>North Somerset Healthcare Library based at Weston General Hospital had access to LibGuides, and as part of this subscription LibAnswers. This function allowed us to set up a secure area in which we could create an electronic procedure manual for both sites. The procedure manual was written in a form of Questions and Answers, these ranged from:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>How should I report a printer fault?</li>
           <li>How do I access/use SPSS software onsite?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Site-specific answers were labelled according to their location, to enable colleagues to find the right information quickly and easily. Following discussions with the whole team we asked what information they would find useful to know about if they were working on the new site. So, this included information about key contacts, telephone numbers. Alongside this we also reviewed the information which was in the two procedures manuals and added this information in the form of questions.</p>

          <p>If there were any pertinent questions for just one site, the question would be categorised and tagged with the location. This meant that it was easy to search for information based on location. We were also able to add categories and further tags, to allow staff to search based on a particular topic, such as chasing orders, reporting faults, or directing users towards particular support and resources.</p>

          <p>Each of our speakers used an After Action Review template to reflect on their work, capture and share lessons learned.</p>

          <p>Hannah Cochrane at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust has a key focus within her role to support and facilitate the mobilisation of knowledge.&nbsp; This has led to the development of several knowledge mobilisation initiatives such as facilitating a regular forum, holding quarterly Randomised Coffee Trials and tailoring support for internationally educated nurses.&nbsp; In the session, Hannah shared the work she has been doing to capture knowledge from colleagues before they leave or change roles.&nbsp; The aim was for the Knowledge Specialist to conduct a structured interview with each colleague who was moving on to support the transfer of knowledge between teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Knowledge Capture Interviews After Action Review</h3>

          <p>What was supposed to happen?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>The development of a project to support effective handover in teams.​</li>
           <li>A meeting with managers to promote the process.​</li>
           <li>A survey to identify the types of knowledge to capture from leavers.​</li>
           <li>The development of interview questions from HEE template and survey.​</li>
           <li>A commitment from Education Team Leads to participate.​</li>
           <li>The facilitation of interviews with department&nbsp; leavers, by the Library’s Knowledge Specialist.​</li>
           <li>A process to gather feedback&nbsp; to inform and develop the service.​</li>
           <li>A sustainable process in place to ensure continuity of work.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>What actually happened?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Project development within a QI Silver programme.​</li>
           <li>A presentation to Education Department managers.​</li>
           <li>A survey of manager’s knowledge needs from leavers.</li>
           <li>Development of a questionnaire and the ‘output’ template.​</li>
           <li>An encouraging response, most managers committed to using the service, though it was unclear whether all leavers were referred to the library.​</li>
           <li>The knowledge Specialist undertook interviews with department leavers. ​</li>
           <li>Feedback was solicited but not always submitted.​</li>
           <li>A request to develop an eLearning module for management training.​</li>
           <li>A meeting with HR, to introduce the project.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Why was there a difference?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Some managers may not have informed the library about leavers&nbsp;because:&nbsp;​
           <ul>
            <li>There were time constraints, or a heavy workload.​</li>
            <li>They had forgotten about the service.</li>
            <li>They preferred to keep processes ‘in house’.​</li>
           </ul>
           </li>
           <li>If the results were not as expected, they may have been reluctant to&nbsp;feedback.​</li>
           <li>There was a recognition of the potential to develop as&nbsp;an&nbsp;eLearning tool&nbsp;and a process to gather experiential knowledge in teams.​</li>
          </ul>

          <p>What can we learn from this?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Demonstrating and promoting the benefits of sharing leavers’ corporate knowledge and best practice&nbsp; - an example interview may ‘sell’ the process more successfully.​</li>
           <li>Speaking to those who have not taken part or given feedback for more information.​</li>
           <li>Proactively contacting leavers to arrange interviews.​</li>
           <li>Using staff stories to illustrate the challenges of taking on a new role.​</li>
           <li>Assessing effectiveness - peer-reviewing the process.​</li>
           <li>Sustainability – developing continuous feedback and review.</li>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">The Living Library</h2>

          <p>Helen Watts from Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust shared helpful tips about running a Living Library, including template documents from the toolkit she has developed.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A Living Library works like a standard library where visitors can browse the catalogue for available titles, choose the book they want to read and borrow it for a limited amount of time.&nbsp; The only difference is that the “books” are human.&nbsp; Each “book” volunteers to take part in the library and share their story.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>From running a couple of Living Library events with partners across Bristol, Helen identified the following lessons learned:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Create aims and objectives for the event to share with everyone involved and use for press releases and promotion</li>
           <li>Link your Living Library event to a larger event e.g. Health Information Week</li>
           <li>About 10 books is a good number but this will depend on your focus, venue size and availability of your volunteers</li>
           <li>Hold a meeting to explain the purpose and recruit your volunteer “books”</li>
           <li>Ask volunteer “books” to write a biography of approximately 150 words to form the catalogue</li>
           <li>Find a venue with space to accommodate your books and borrowers – you will need an issue desk, waiting area and quite areas where conversations can take place.&nbsp; Take time setting this up and thinking about your layout</li>
           <li>Prepare a registration sheet so borrowers can be issued with a library card and agree to abide by the Living Library rules</li>
           <li>Create a timing record sheet of who is borrowing which book when</li>
           <li>Develop some evaluation forms</li>
           <li>Ensure facilitators can be easily identified wearing badges or themed t-shirts</li>
           <li>Create table signs for each book explaining their role</li>
           <li>Publicise widely</li>
           <li>Have as many people on hand to help as possible</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Participating in the FabChange 2020 and 2021 Campaigns&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>The FabChange campaign of sharing change stories was promoted as part of the weLearn programme at Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust.&nbsp; This programme aims to share best practice, research, innovation, and quality improvement across the organisation.&nbsp; Preeti Puligari and Stacey Richards walked us through their role in collecting and sharing Fab stories.&nbsp; The campaign was promoted, and a generic email address was set up to receive submissions on the shared template.&nbsp; With the help of the communications department some of these were recorded as video clips.&nbsp; The stories and videos were collated on the Trust intranet, a report shared within the Trust and submissions uploaded to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/u_MBCj0NQFDLG8qiWxfjM?domain=fabnhsstuff.net/" target="_blank">FabChange website</a>.&nbsp; In 2021 an impact survey was conducted to see if the changes were sustained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;What was learnt?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Campaign details from FabChange comes out at short notice so adding the FabChange event to the annual calendar of recurring activities helps to get planning and promotion in early enough&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Sustaining interest is hard.&nbsp; Once changes have been made some teams revert to business as usual – the follow-up survey helped to remind people about the change they had made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>A new person leading the initiative can bring new thinking and new approaches to campaigns such as these&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Linking learning and change ideas in with other Trust work such as the weLearn programme deliverables, helps to improve how the learning is shared within the organisation and is purposeful to the Trust objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>New platforms and communities such as the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qoBrCkrNQhAVX9QSV80Ym?domain=england.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Beneficial Changes Network</a> can help knowledge about the changes to be spread more widely&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>After hearing the three presentations a short Espresso Café was held to discuss the learning and consider what ideas or tips could be taken and applied elsewhere.&nbsp; The discussion covered the benefit of aligning events to organisational priorities, making use of contacts and champions, and using events to make better connections within the organisation.&nbsp; Knowledge capture was seen as something that could really help new starters and living libraries were regarded as having many potential uses including for recruitment or at careers fairs.&nbsp; For all knowledge mobilisation events senior stakeholder buy-in was agreed to be a key to success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">Knowledge Mobilisation and Events</h2>

          <p>Each of our speakers used an After Action Review template to reflect on their work, capture and share lessons learned.</p>

          <p>Hannah Cochrane at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust has a key focus within her role to support and facilitate the mobilisation of knowledge.&nbsp; This has led to the development of several knowledge mobilisation initiatives such as facilitating a regular forum, holding quarterly Randomised Coffee Trials and tailoring support for internationally educated nurses.&nbsp; In the session, Hannah shared the work she has been doing to capture knowledge from colleagues before they leave or change roles.&nbsp; The aim was for the Knowledge Specialist to conduct a structured interview with each colleague who was moving on to support the transfer of knowledge between teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Knowledge Capture Interviews After Action Review</h3>

          <p>What was supposed to happen?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>The development of a project to support effective handover in teams.​</li>
           <li>A meeting with managers to promote the process.​</li>
           <li>A survey to identify the types of knowledge to capture from leavers.​</li>
           <li>The development of interview questions from HEE template and survey.​</li>
           <li>A commitment from Education Team Leads to participate.​</li>
           <li>The facilitation of interviews with department&nbsp; leavers, by the Library’s Knowledge Specialist.​</li>
           <li>A process to gather feedback&nbsp; to inform and develop the service.​</li>
           <li>A sustainable process in place to ensure continuity of work.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>What actually happened?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Project development within a QI Silver programme.​</li>
           <li>A presentation to Education Department managers.​</li>
           <li>A survey of manager’s knowledge needs from leavers.</li>
           <li>Development of a questionnaire and the ‘output’ template.​</li>
           <li>An encouraging response, most managers committed to using the service, though it was unclear whether all leavers were referred to the library.​</li>
           <li>The knowledge Specialist undertook interviews with department leavers. ​</li>
           <li>Feedback was solicited but not always submitted.​</li>
           <li>A request to develop an eLearning module for management training.​</li>
           <li>A meeting with HR, to introduce the project.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Why was there a difference?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Some managers may not have informed the library about leavers&nbsp;because:&nbsp;​
           <ul>
            <li>There were time constraints, or a heavy workload.​</li>
            <li>They had forgotten about the service.</li>
            <li>They preferred to keep processes ‘in house’.​</li>
           </ul>
           </li>
           <li>If the results were not as expected, they may have been reluctant to&nbsp;feedback.​</li>
           <li>There was a recognition of the potential to develop as&nbsp;an&nbsp;eLearning tool&nbsp;and a process to gather experiential knowledge in teams.​</li>
          </ul>

          <p>What can we learn from this?</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Demonstrating and promoting the benefits of sharing leavers’ corporate knowledge and best practice&nbsp; - an example interview may ‘sell’ the process more successfully.​</li>
           <li>Speaking to those who have not taken part or given feedback for more information.​</li>
           <li>Proactively contacting leavers to arrange interviews.​</li>
           <li>Using staff stories to illustrate the challenges of taking on a new role.​</li>
           <li>Assessing effectiveness - peer-reviewing the process.​</li>
           <li>Sustainability – developing continuous feedback and review.</li>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;">The Living Library</h2>

          <p>Helen Watts from Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust shared helpful tips about running a Living Library, including template documents from the toolkit she has developed.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>A Living Library works like a standard library where visitors can browse the catalogue for available titles, choose the book they want to read and borrow it for a limited amount of time.&nbsp; The only difference is that the “books” are human.&nbsp; Each “book” volunteers to take part in the library and share their story.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>From running a couple of Living Library events with partners across Bristol, Helen identified the following lessons learned:</p>

          <ul>
           <li>Create aims and objectives for the event to share with everyone involved and use for press releases and promotion</li>
           <li>Link your Living Library event to a larger event e.g. Health Information Week</li>
           <li>About 10 books is a good number but this will depend on your focus, venue size and availability of your volunteers</li>
           <li>Hold a meeting to explain the purpose and recruit your volunteer “books”</li>
           <li>Ask volunteer “books” to write a biography of approximately 150 words to form the catalogue</li>
           <li>Find a venue with space to accommodate your books and borrowers – you will need an issue desk, waiting area and quite areas where conversations can take place.&nbsp; Take time setting this up and thinking about your layout</li>
           <li>Prepare a registration sheet so borrowers can be issued with a library card and agree to abide by the Living Library rules</li>
           <li>Create a timing record sheet of who is borrowing which book when</li>
           <li>Develop some evaluation forms</li>
           <li>Ensure facilitators can be easily identified wearing badges or themed t-shirts</li>
           <li>Create table signs for each book explaining their role</li>
           <li>Publicise widely</li>
           <li>Have as many people on hand to help as possible</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Participating in the FabChange 2020 and 2021 Campaigns&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>The FabChange campaign of sharing change stories was promoted as part of the weLearn programme at Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust.&nbsp; This programme aims to share best practice, research, innovation, and quality improvement across the organisation.&nbsp; Preeti Puligari and Stacey Richards walked us through their role in collecting and sharing Fab stories.&nbsp; The campaign was promoted, and a generic email address was set up to receive submissions on the shared template.&nbsp; With the help of the communications department some of these were recorded as video clips.&nbsp; The stories and videos were collated on the Trust intranet, a report shared within the Trust and submissions uploaded to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/u_MBCj0NQFDLG8qiWxfjM?domain=fabnhsstuff.net/" target="_blank">FabChange website</a>.&nbsp; In 2021 an impact survey was conducted to see if the changes were sustained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;What was learnt?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Campaign details from FabChange comes out at short notice so adding the FabChange event to the annual calendar of recurring activities helps to get planning and promotion in early enough&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Sustaining interest is hard.&nbsp; Once changes have been made some teams revert to business as usual – the follow-up survey helped to remind people about the change they had made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>A new person leading the initiative can bring new thinking and new approaches to campaigns such as these&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Linking learning and change ideas in with other Trust work such as the weLearn programme deliverables, helps to improve how the learning is shared within the organisation and is purposeful to the Trust objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>New platforms and communities such as the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qoBrCkrNQhAVX9QSV80Ym?domain=england.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Beneficial Changes Network</a> can help knowledge about the changes to be spread more widely&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>After hearing the three presentations a short Espresso Café was held to discuss the learning and consider what ideas or tips could be taken and applied elsewhere.&nbsp; The discussion covered the benefit of aligning events to organisational priorities, making use of contacts and champions, and using events to make better connections within the organisation.&nbsp; Knowledge capture was seen as something that could really help new starters and living libraries were regarded as having many potential uses including for recruitment or at careers fairs.&nbsp; For all knowledge mobilisation events senior stakeholder buy-in was agreed to be a key to success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

           <li>
           <p>Sustaining interest is hard.&nbsp; Once changes have been made some teams revert to business as usual – the follow-up survey helped to remind people about the change they had made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>A new person leading the initiative can bring new thinking and new approaches to campaigns such as these&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Linking learning and change ideas in with other Trust work such as the weLearn programme deliverables, helps to improve how the learning is shared within the organisation and is purposeful to the Trust objectives&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>New platforms and communities such as the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/qoBrCkrNQhAVX9QSV80Ym?domain=england.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">Beneficial Changes Network</a> can help knowledge about the changes to be spread more widely&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>After hearing the three presentations a short Espresso Café was held to discuss the learning and consider what ideas or tips could be taken and applied elsewhere.&nbsp; The discussion covered the benefit of aligning events to organisational priorities, making use of contacts and champions, and using events to make better connections within the organisation.&nbsp; Knowledge capture was seen as something that could really help new starters and living libraries were regarded as having many potential uses including for recruitment or at careers fairs.&nbsp; For all knowledge mobilisation events senior stakeholder buy-in was agreed to be a key to success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Continuous Improvement Project Tracker&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>Tilly Dixon shared the work she has been doing with the quality improvement team at Mid Cheshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, raising awareness of quality improvement.&nbsp; The aim was to develop a process to record and share all the improvement work taking place so people could easily see what had been done previously and what was currently underway.&nbsp; The Improvement Director had a good idea of what was required and shared her ideas with the library team.&nbsp; Tilly mapped this specification into a process that clarified what inputs and outputs were required at each stage.&nbsp; Tilly then looked for a no-cost solution to develop a system to do this.&nbsp; A decision was taken to use Microsoft Office 365 to develop this.&nbsp; Microsoft forms were used to log the projects, SharePoint was used to hold all the details underpinned by a SharePoint Directory to hold all the associated documents.&nbsp; Tilly created a power automate flow that took the project submission form information and automatically created an entry on SharePoint.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following testing with the quality improvement team, more formal stakeholder testing took place before the system went live.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Some of the learning from developing the Continuous Improvement Project Tracker includes:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Good collaboration between the teams involved led to an iterative approach to designing a workable solution&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Understanding more about the potential of Office 365 has led to the work being adopted and adapted by other teams to create repositories and the SharePoint Web front-end is popular.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>This single approach is easy to adapt and apply to other repository-style projects, for example&nbsp; Clinical Audit and Research have adapted the process and it is being used a as proof of concept to manage locally produced clinical guidelines and to hold evidence search results&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Freely available Microsoft training is helpful for becoming skilled at using Office 365 tools&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Embedding Knowledge Management into in-house quality improvement training&nbsp;</h2>

          <p>Jess Pawley from Somerset NHS Foundation Trust shared her learning, including what did not work so well, when embedding knowledge management into an in-house quality improvement training programme.&nbsp; As an embedded knowledge specialist working within the trust quality improvement team for a number of years Jess was keen to introduce knowledge management concepts.&nbsp; However, the initial approach took lots of re-working before it finally got embedded into the in-house quality improvement training. Lots of learning was gained from not being able to get this to work initially and this learning is now being applied to rolling-out knowledge management concepts to the wider trust.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Key learning from Jess was:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Be clear about what you are setting out to achieve or the problem you are hoping to solve by using a knowledge mobilisation technique.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Be prepared to discuss and find the right language for the team you are working with to describe knowledge mobilisation.&nbsp; For the quality improvement team, the term knowledge management had more meaning.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Mapping where mobilising evidence and knowledge can fit alongside an existing process can help people to see how it can be used in practice.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Using knowledge mobilisation tools, such as the Before Action Review, is a useful way to prepare for the introduction of other knowledge mobilisation activities&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Working in collaboration with others and adapting knowledge mobilisation tools to suit the circumstances of the team is a great way to succeed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

           <p>Be prepared to discuss and find the right language for the team you are working with to describe knowledge mobilisation.&nbsp; For the quality improvement team, the term knowledge management had more meaning.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Mapping where mobilising evidence and knowledge can fit alongside an existing process can help people to see how it can be used in practice.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Using knowledge mobilisation tools, such as the Before Action Review, is a useful way to prepare for the introduction of other knowledge mobilisation activities&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Working in collaboration with others and adapting knowledge mobilisation tools to suit the circumstances of the team is a great way to succeed&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Embedding a knowledge mobilisation session into Trust leadership programmes&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>At Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sarah Stones described how she teamed-up with organisers of Trust leadership development programmes to share an overview of the Knowledge Mobilisation Framework within the programmes.&nbsp; In the leadership session Sarah gave a presentation about the&nbsp; Knowledge Mobilisation Framework, followed by 3 short 10-minute espresso café discussions prompted by the knowledge mobilisation postcards.&nbsp; This initial development took place in person but following the COVID-19 pandemic was switched to MS Teams and extended out to the more senior leadership development programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The sessions provided a good opportunity to raise the profile of the library and knowledge service and knowledge mobilisation more generally. Learning from the sessions included:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>To have more impact it would be easier to share just two or three of the knowledge mobilisation tools rather than trying to cover off all of the tools in the framework.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Knowledge harvesting was particularly popular as were tools to help share knowledge during and after projects as this is often not done well.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Library and Knowledge Services and Sustainable Healthcare&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>Pippa Orr shared her work with the Sustainable Healthcare group at Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear.&nbsp; Below are the results from Pippa in an After Action Review format.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What was supposed to happen?&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>I joined the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (CNTW) in 2019, when climate emergencies began to be declared and we started to see more in the media about climate change and its impacts.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>And I wanted to raise awareness of climate change across the Trust.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>What actually happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>I produced the monthly Health Management Current Awareness Bulletin. The distribution list included most of the senior management roles within the Trust and I saw this as an opportunity to reach them directly. So, we added a Sustainable Healthcare heading and started to include items relating to the links between climate change and mental health. This led to&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Invitation to join the CNTWClimateHealth Steering Group. My manager agreed it as an appraisal objective.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Topic Review evidence search on green care and theming of results, using Endnote (we triage evidence search requests, offering basic, comprehensive or topic review).&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>“I think a topic review please. Green care is a fundamental part of our task and thorough baseline review would be a very helpful start.” Consultant Psychiatrist, April 2020.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>“It’s fantastic work! The RCPsych were really interested and would like us to share it with them. It will certainly go into our Models of Care strategy document… It will also be very helpful in proposing new services and supporting the maintenance of existing ones.” Consultant Psychiatrist, April 2020.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Contributed knowhow to Climate Health Group conversations and growing the network.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Further evidence searches, e.g., recycling PPE, review of Transport and E-Vehicle Policy.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Document summaries.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Registering Steering Group members onto KnowledgeShare.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Whole LKS Team involved, e.g., books (both purchased and loaned), recycling, signposting, joined CNTWClimateHealth Lunchtime Conversations on 7 different themes, supporting the Green Plan 2021.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>I talk about the CNTWClimateHealth Group when presenting to Team meetings and during Randomised Coffee Conversations.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>I collate Schwartz Round resource lists, including for a planned event looking at climate anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Why was there a difference?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>I thought of creating a separate Bulletin on sustainable healthcare but that risked attracting people who were already aware of climate change issues, and we need more people to engage, as it was and still is a climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>What can we learn from this?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Get involved at the beginning, for searching.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Start small and see where it goes.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Just do it.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Be flexible and open minded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Be proactive.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Invite yourself to meetings.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Be part of the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Not enough hours in the day.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Make every contact count!&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>The climate emergency continues.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p>In the following discussion participants were reminded of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/about/sustainability/kls-and-sustainability" target="_blank">Sustainability Community of Practice</a> as a workspace to share ideas and tips on sustainability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Everyone was inspired by Pippa’s final words and the need to “Just Do It” applied to all the speakers sharing their good knowledge mobilisation practice ideas and tips.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Thank you to all speakers for sharing their learning and to Liz Jordan and Jess Pawley for organising the session.&nbsp;</p>

           </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Why was there a difference?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>I thought of creating a separate Bulletin on sustainable healthcare but that risked attracting people who were already aware of climate change issues, and we need more people to engage, as it was and still is a climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>What can we learn from this?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Get involved at the beginning, for searching.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>

           <li>
           <p>Just do it.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Be flexible and open minded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Invite yourself to meetings.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>

           <p>Make every contact count!&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Everyone was inspired by Pippa’s final words and the need to “Just Do It” applied to all the speakers sharing their good knowledge mobilisation practice ideas and tips.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Embedding a knowledge mobilisation session into Trust leadership programmes&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>At Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sarah Stones described how she teamed-up with organisers of Trust leadership development programmes to share an overview of the Knowledge Mobilisation Framework within the programmes.&nbsp; In the leadership session Sarah gave a presentation about the&nbsp; Knowledge Mobilisation Framework, followed by 3 short 10-minute espresso café discussions prompted by the knowledge mobilisation postcards.&nbsp; This initial development took place in person but following the COVID-19 pandemic was switched to MS Teams and extended out to the more senior leadership development programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The sessions provided a good opportunity to raise the profile of the library and knowledge service and knowledge mobilisation more generally. Learning from the sessions included:&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>To have more impact it would be easier to share just two or three of the knowledge mobilisation tools rather than trying to cover off all of the tools in the framework.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Knowledge harvesting was particularly popular as were tools to help share knowledge during and after projects as this is often not done well.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>To aid understanding and relevance participants needed to understand how the tools could help with their own work – this often involved using less jargon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Discussion of the tools led to some useful conversations and follow-up work.</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>A shorter, more interactive presentation with more time for discussion is more effective.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Joining forces to support GOLD Command in Leeds during the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>Helen Swales, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust&nbsp; and Jenny Emmel, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust shared how they worked together to support GOLD command in Leeds during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>In April 2020 Leeds Community Healthcare library team were asked to support the weekly Health and Social Care Intelligence reports.&nbsp; Due to the time required to compile these the Leeds Community Team reached out to the Teaching Hospitals team for help. Over time the weekly briefings were produced on a fortnightly basis. It was very time consuming for library staff to produce these but there were real benefits to working in partnership rather than as a single library service in doing this vital work.&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Library and Knowledge Services and Sustainable Healthcare&nbsp;</h3>

          <p>Pippa Orr shared her work with the Sustainable Healthcare group at Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear.&nbsp; Below are the results from Pippa in an After Action Review format.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What was supposed to happen?&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>I joined the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (CNTW) in 2019, when climate emergencies began to be declared and we started to see more in the media about climate change and its impacts.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>And I wanted to raise awareness of climate change across the Trust.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>What actually happened?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>I produced the monthly Health Management Current Awareness Bulletin. The distribution list included most of the senior management roles within the Trust and I saw this as an opportunity to reach them directly. So, we added a Sustainable Healthcare heading and started to include items relating to the links between climate change and mental health. This led to&nbsp;</p>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Invitation to join the CNTWClimateHealth Steering Group. My manager agreed it as an appraisal objective.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Topic Review evidence search on green care and theming of results, using Endnote (we triage evidence search requests, offering basic, comprehensive or topic review).&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>“I think a topic review please. Green care is a fundamental part of our task and thorough baseline review would be a very helpful start.” Consultant Psychiatrist, April 2020.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>“It’s fantastic work! The RCPsych were really interested and would like us to share it with them. It will certainly go into our Models of Care strategy document… It will also be very helpful in proposing new services and supporting the maintenance of existing ones.” Consultant Psychiatrist, April 2020.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Contributed knowhow to Climate Health Group conversations and growing the network.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>Further evidence searches, e.g., recycling PPE, review of Transport and E-Vehicle Policy.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Document summaries.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Registering Steering Group members onto KnowledgeShare.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>Whole LKS Team involved, e.g., books (both purchased and loaned), recycling, signposting, joined CNTWClimateHealth Lunchtime Conversations on 7 different themes, supporting the Green Plan 2021.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
           <li>
           <p>I talk about the CNTWClimateHealth Group when presenting to Team meetings and during Randomised Coffee Conversations.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
           <li>
           <p>I collate Schwartz Round resource lists, including for a planned event looking at climate anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
           </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Why was there a difference?&nbsp;</strong></p>

          <p>I thought of creating a separate Bulletin on sustainable healthcare but that risked attracting people who were already aware of climate change issues, and we need more people to engage, as it was and still is a climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">It can be overwhelming to undertake learning these new skills, which come with a whole new language to learn as well. You may also be asking why knowledge and library staff should invest their time in this?</span></span></span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Knowledge and library staff already have a number of core skills which help place us as the natural leaders in this area of work. For example, data engineering incorporates the collection and management of raw data, amongst other things. Our skills in collection management, such as cataloguing and understanding metadata, set us in a prime position to undertake this work within our organisations. And whilst programming (the process of writing computer programming) on first thought can seem like a stretch, many of us are already responsible for our own webpages or adding information on to intranet pages, and so are doing some of this on a very basic level. More in depth skills in programming will allow us to make data tell a story, for example pulling your data from several different sources in to one dashboard showing the story of your service through use. </span></span></span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">This may still seem out of reach, but HEE want to support our network in building awareness and signposting opportunities to develop skills so they can be used in our current work, future proofing our profession for the inevitable changes ahead. We have created a new page on the Learning Zone with definitions of new terminology and a resource list to get you started. We are putting together a programme of events to build your confidence and skills in this varied area of work. You may have already undertaken a Library Carpentry course, or the recent Chat Bot session. More courses and details will be advertised soon for staff at all levels. If you are interested in being more involved you can join our <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/emerging-technologies#current4">Current and Emerging Technologies Community of Practice</a>, where we discuss emerging tech and it’s potential application in our work. </span></span></span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">The <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/">Topol Review (2019)</a> recommended an increase in the number of knowledge specialists to meet the demands of the NHS as a knowledge-based industry. Building our skills and confidence in data and digital advancements will enable us to make the most of innovative emerging technologies in libraries and in healthcare, positioning knowledge and library staff as digital leaders. </span></span></span></p>

For example, data engineering incorporates the collection and management of raw data, amongst other things. Our skills in collection management, such as cataloguing and understanding metadata, set us in a prime position to undertake this work within our organisations. And whilst programming (the process of writing computer programming) on first thought can seem like a stretch, many of us are already responsible for our own webpages or adding information on to intranet pages, and so are doing some of this on a very basic level. More in depth skills in programming will allow us to make data tell a story, for example pulling your data from several different sources in to one dashboard showing the story of your service through use. </span></span></span></p>

We have created a new page on the Learning Zone with definitions of new terminology and a resource list to get you started. We are putting together a programme of events to build your confidence and skills in this varied area of work. You may have already undertaken a Library Carpentry course, or the recent Chat Bot session. More courses and details will be advertised soon for staff at all levels.
