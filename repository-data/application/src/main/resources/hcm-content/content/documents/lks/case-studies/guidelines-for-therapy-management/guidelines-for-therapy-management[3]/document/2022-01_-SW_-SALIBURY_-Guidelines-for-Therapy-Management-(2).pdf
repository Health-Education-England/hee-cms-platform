Trust and Name of KLS: Salisbury NHS Foundation 
Trust Healthcare Library 
 

Date 20.12.2021 
 

Reason for enquiry 

Development of guidelines regarding the use of mirror therapy in the management of pain in 
patients following peripheral nerve injury in the upper limb for the Salisbury District Hospital 
Upper Limb Therapy Team. The results will also be presented at the regional network - the 
Wessex Hand Club and will include reviewing and updating the information that is given to 
patients. 
 

What the knowledge and library specialist did 

Undertook multiple literature searches covering healthcare databases and specialist 
physiotherapy websites on the use of mirror therapy and desensitisation techniques in hand 
peripheral nerve injury rehabilitation. 
 
The project lead commented: “Your efforts have been appreciated and invaluable in enabling 
me to complete my tasks.” 

Impact of input from the library and knowledge 
service 
Immediate Impact 

The search results were used to help develop a set of guidelines on the therapy management of 
peripheral nerve injuries in the upper limb. The guidelines are a reference manual that will 
ensure that the hand therapists have a full understanding of the patient pathway following 
peripheral nerve injury in the hand.  Much of the journey of recovery is undertaken by the 
patient following discharge from the acute services. These guidelines will help to ensure that the 
patient is given detailed and evidence-based guidance on how to self-manage their condition. 
On the back of this work, the hand therapy team are setting up a structured long-term follow-up 
clinic for patients, to better support them after this devastating injury, which often has life 
changing implications. 
 

Probable future Impact 

The guidelines have also been circulated and presented to the Wessex Hand Club regional 
network so will influence the guidelines used by hospitals across the region.
