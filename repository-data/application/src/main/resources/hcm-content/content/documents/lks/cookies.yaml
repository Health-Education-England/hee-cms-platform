        <h3>Which cookies we use</h3>

        <h4>SERVERID</h4>

        <p>This is a Bloomreach Experience Manager cookie. It's an essential cookie that's required for the website to function. It expires after 30 minutes.</p>

        <h4>_hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress</h4>

        <p>This is a Hotjar cookie used to count how many times different users visit the site. It assigns the users an ID, so the user does not get registered twice.&nbsp;It expires after 30 minutes.</p>

        <h4>_hjFirstSeen</h4>

        <p>This is a Hotjar cookie that tells us if this is the first time you've visited the site. It expires at the&nbsp;end of your session.</p>

        <h4>_hjid</h4>

        <p>This is a Hotjar cookie that's set when the user first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It creates a unique ID for your session to help tell us how you use our site. It expires after&nbsp;1 year.</p>

        <h4>_hjIncludedInPageviewSample</h4>

        <p>This cookie lets Hotjar know if you're part of a group of users we're sampling for information about how the site is being used.&nbsp; It expires after 30 minutes.</p>

        <h4>_hjSession_944417</h4>

        <p>This is a Hotjar cookie that holds the current session data. This makes sure that subsequent requests within the session window will be attributed to the same Hotjar session.&nbsp;It expires after 30 minutes.</p>

        <h4>_hjSessionUser_944417</h4>

        <p>This is a Hotjar cookie that's set when a user first lands on a page with the Hotjar script. It's used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser. This ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID. It expires after&nbsp;1 year.</p>

        <h4>_hjTLDTest</h4>

        <p>When the Hotjar script executes we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. This is done so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed. It expires at the&nbsp;end of your session.</p>

        <h4>_ga</h4>

        <p>This is a Google Analytics cookie used to tell users apart. This then gives us data about how people are using the site.&nbsp;It expires after 2 years.</p>

        <h4>_ga_#</h4>

        <p>This is a Google Analytics cookie used to collect data on the number of times a user has visited the site, as well as dates for the first and most recent visit.&nbsp;It expires after 2 years.</p>

        <h4>Other cookies</h4>
