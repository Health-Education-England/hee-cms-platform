                <p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Hannah Cochrane</strong> - is a Knowledge Specialist Librarian at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust (UHBW) Knowledge and Library Service. A key focus of her job is to support and facilitate the mobilisation of knowledge at UHBW. This is a really exciting project which has seen the development of several KM initiatives such as a regular Forum, Knowledge Capture Interviews, a quarterly Randomised Coffee Trial and tailored support for the Internationally Educated Nurses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>She has been in this role for just over a year and finds her work varied and interesting - she is learning all the time! Importantly though, she has seen the value&nbsp;that KM and library services can bring to the organistaion. She is constantly&nbsp;impressed by the work and research that her colleagues do, and feels very lucky to be part of such a great team.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Helen Watts</strong> - she&nbsp;qualified as a librarian in 2004 having previously worked as a library assistant in a large public library and as a school librarian since 1988. Whilst working as a library assistant and bringing up a young family Helen undertook a degree with the Open University and then a Masters at Bristol University. Helen’s first qualified role was working across two NHS Trusts delivering library services to staff working in the Mental Health sector. After working in this role for 11 years, Helen became the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust library and knowledge services manager in 2016. Drawn to a career in libraries by a love of books and information, equality and helping people, expectations of having an interesting job have been realised and Helen appreciates the variety of people and work that working in the NHS affords where no two days are ever the same. Highlights of her career so far have been collaborating on a Living Library Project with University of the West of England in 2018 and with Bristol Public libraries, United Hospital Bristol &amp; Weston and North Bristol Trust in 2019 and getting a positive interview onto local BBC media about AWP mental Health Trust following that project.</p>

                <p>The Living Library lightening talk will give a basic overview of what happens during an LL, how to prepare and discuss the benefits as to why library services should undertake this type of engagement activity.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Pippa Orr</strong> - Pippa will talk about how her Library and Knowledge Service contributes to sustainable healthcare in the North East and north Cumbria, as part of Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (CNTW), a large Mental Health and Learning Disability Trust stretching from West to East coast.</p>

                <p>She was brought up in South Lakes, with regular trips into the Lake District fells, but didn’t appreciate until years later how important the natural world is to all of us. Whilst living in London,&nbsp; she volunteered with the successful Campaign for Lead Free Air (CLEAR) in the 1980s, leading to the introduction of unleaded petrol.</p>

                <p><strong>Tilly Dixon</strong> -&nbsp; is a Digital Librarian at Mid Cheshire Hospitals Foundation Trust. Tilly is relatively new to the NHS, having worked previously as an IT Consultant for several multi-national corporations. Her interests are digital literacy, knowledge mobilisation, and building our future digital workforce. She volunteers at her local library offering IT and family history research support.</p>

                <p><strong>Jess Pawley </strong>- is the Knowledge and Evidence Specialist for Quality Improvement at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, a role she has held for just over 3 years after having worked her way up via library assistant and clinical librarian. She is part of the national Evidence 4 Quality Improvement (E4QI) community of practice, and during the pandemic was seconded to NHS England where she helped establish a knowledge management and evidence service for the COVID-19 Behaviour Change Unit. She is a mentor for CILIP and is working (slowly) on Knowledge Management Chartership.</p>

                <p>Outside of work she can be found at the swimming pool before most normal people are awake, and generally finds it very hard to spend any length of time sitting still.</p>

                <p><strong>Helen Swales</strong> -&nbsp;Helen started her career at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, before moving into Health Libraries in 1996.&nbsp; After two years at Bradford Royal Infirmary she took on the role of Librarian for Leeds Health Authority, and after various organisational restructures, is now Library Services Manager for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, managing delivery of the library service for all LCH staff across Leeds and also via Service Level Agreements delivery of library services to primary care in Leeds and public health staff in Leeds City Council.&nbsp;Helen also chairs the city-wide Project Team for improving access to health library services in Leeds, with specific responsibility for service development.</p>

                <p><strong>Jenny Emmel</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Jenny began her career in London public libraries, before moving to Leeds in 2005, to take up a role at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Jenny is the Corporate Support Librarian, a job role she shares with Beth Tapster.&nbsp; In this role she specifically focuses on supporting the information needs of non-clinical staff and nurses by providing evidence searches and training.&nbsp; She also administers the library management system and website, both of which are multi-organisation systems shared by the three Leeds NHS Trusts and the Public Health Resource Centre.</span></span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Sarah Stones</strong> -&nbsp;Sarah is currently the Library &amp; Knowledge Services Manager for Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which provides services to the Trust, local CCG, primary care and public health teams. She has worked in health libraries since 1992, starting out as Library and Information Officer for Mid-Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, then as Faculty Team Librarian for the University of Nottingham School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery, before moving to the Library &amp; Knowledge Service at Sherwood Forest Hospitals. Sarah also co-chairs the Nottinghamshire Health Information Forum and has a keen interest in health and wellbeing and health literacy.</span></span></p>

                <p><strong>Date: </strong>Wednesday 30th November</p>

                <p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>10.00 - 11.30</p>

                <p><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Come along to this interactive session to learn more about the research agenda and discuss how research is disseminated as we’re joined by the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR).&nbsp;</p>

                <p>NIHR funds projects and people to carry out research across health, public health and social care. The findings of this research ends up in academic journals, with thousands of articles being published every year. Open Access policies mean that more and more people can now access those scientific research articles for free. But they’re often lengthy and full of technical language making them difficult to understand.</p>

                <p><a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR Evidence</a> aims to make the findings of the research they fund and support more accessible and understandable. They are also exploring innovative ways to get research findings in front of the people who are best-placed to use them. For example, exploring the use of Wikipedia, podcasts and infographics to disseminate research.</p>

                <p>As part of this Knowledge cafe, we will be covering:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>NIHR's role as a funder in disseminating knowledge</li>
                 <li>How NIHR works, what they produce and how it helps research to be understood</li>
                 <li>Some of the innovations they’ve been exploring, including the role of Wikipedia, podcasts, and republishing in known journals</li>
                 <li>What they’ve learnt about adapting what they produce to reach different audiences</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will then have a chance to discuss different ways to disseminate research, what’s effective, how this relates to your role and how NIHR could support NHS knowledge and library service staff in the future. This will include discussion questions including:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>Do plain English summaries of research evidence make a difference to how research is used?</li>
                 <li>How could NIHR outputs help you mobilise knowledge to your users?</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Speakers:&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Candace Imison -</strong>Candace oversees the NIHR’s dissemination and knowledge mobilisation activity.

                <p><strong>Dr Deniz Gursul -&nbsp;</strong>Deniz holds a DPhil in neonatal pain and brain imaging from University of Oxford, and gained experience in medical writing before joining the NIHR. She is involved in the selection of papers and ensuring the scientific accuracy of our products.</p>

                <p><strong>Martha Powell -&nbsp;</strong>Martha is in the communications team at NIHR, working to ensure that the products we produce around research findings reach the people who can act on them.

                <p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Hannah Cochrane</strong> - is a Knowledge Specialist Librarian at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust (UHBW) Knowledge and Library Service. A key focus of her job is to support and facilitate the mobilisation of knowledge at UHBW. This is a really exciting project which has seen the development of several KM initiatives such as a regular Forum, Knowledge Capture Interviews, a quarterly Randomised Coffee Trial and tailored support for the Internationally Educated Nurses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>She has been in this role for just over a year and finds her work varied and interesting - she is learning all the time! Importantly though, she has seen the value&nbsp;that KM and library services can bring to the organistaion. She is constantly&nbsp;impressed by the work and research that her colleagues do, and feels very lucky to be part of such a great team.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Helen Watts</strong> - she&nbsp;qualified as a librarian in 2004 having previously worked as a library assistant in a large public library and as a school librarian since 1988. Whilst working as a library assistant and bringing up a young family Helen undertook a degree with the Open University and then a Masters at Bristol University. Helen’s first qualified role was working across two NHS Trusts delivering library services to staff working in the Mental Health sector. After working in this role for 11 years, Helen became the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust library and knowledge services manager in 2016. Drawn to a career in libraries by a love of books and information, equality and helping people, expectations of having an interesting job have been realised and Helen appreciates the variety of people and work that working in the NHS affords where no two days are ever the same. Highlights of her career so far have been collaborating on a Living Library Project with University of the West of England in 2018 and with Bristol Public libraries, United Hospital Bristol &amp; Weston and North Bristol Trust in 2019 and getting a positive interview onto local BBC media about AWP mental Health Trust following that project.</p>

                <p>The Living Library lightening talk will give a basic overview of what happens during an LL, how to prepare and discuss the benefits as to why library services should undertake this type of engagement activity.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Pippa Orr</strong> - Pippa will talk about how her Library and Knowledge Service contributes to sustainable healthcare in the North East and north Cumbria, as part of Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (CNTW), a large Mental Health and Learning Disability Trust stretching from West to East coast.</p>

                <p>She was brought up in South Lakes, with regular trips into the Lake District fells, but didn’t appreciate until years later how important the natural world is to all of us. Whilst living in London,&nbsp; she volunteered with the successful Campaign for Lead Free Air (CLEAR) in the 1980s, leading to the introduction of unleaded petrol.</p>

                <p><strong>Tilly Dixon</strong> -&nbsp; is a Digital Librarian at Mid Cheshire Hospitals Foundation Trust. Tilly is relatively new to the NHS, having worked previously as an IT Consultant for several multi-national corporations.

                <p><strong>Date: </strong>Wednesday 30th November</p>

                <p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>10.00 - 11.30</p>

                <p><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Come along to this interactive session to learn more about the research agenda and discuss how research is disseminated as we’re joined by the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR).&nbsp;</p>

                <p>NIHR funds projects and people to carry out research across health, public health and social care. The findings of this research ends up in academic journals, with thousands of articles being published every year. Open Access policies mean that more and more people can now access those scientific research articles for free. But they’re often lengthy and full of technical language making them difficult to understand.</p>

                <p><a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR Evidence</a> aims to make the findings of the research they fund and support more accessible and understandable. They are also exploring innovative ways to get research findings in front of the people who are best-placed to use them. For example, exploring the use of Wikipedia, podcasts and infographics to disseminate research.</p>

                <p>As part of this Knowledge cafe, we will be covering:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>NIHR's role as a funder in disseminating knowledge</li>
                 <li>How NIHR works, what they produce and how it helps research to be understood</li>
                 <li>Some of the innovations they’ve been exploring, including the role of Wikipedia, podcasts, and republishing in known journals</li>
                 <li>What they’ve learnt about adapting what they produce to reach different audiences</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will then have a chance to discuss different ways to disseminate research, what’s effective, how this relates to your role and how NIHR could support NHS knowledge and library service staff in the future. This will include discussion questions including:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>Do plain English summaries of research evidence make a difference to how research is used?</li>
                 <li>How could NIHR outputs help you mobilise knowledge to your users?</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Speakers:&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Candace Imison -</strong>Candace oversees the NIHR’s dissemination and knowledge mobilisation activity. She has an undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University and a Masters Degree in Health Policy and Health Economics from Birmingham University.

She has researched and published on workforce, future health care trends and service reconfiguration. Candace has senior management experience at board level for NHS providers, commissioners and regulators.</p>

                <p><strong>Professor Lindsay Bearne -&nbsp;</strong>Lindsay is a registered physiotherapist and has a background in physical activity, rehabilitation and self-management research. Her current research focuses on the consequences of long-term conditions (rheumatic, musculoskeletal and vascular disease), rehabilitation, and the translation of evidence into practice. Alongside this, Lindsay is a Senior Research Fellow in Knowledge Mobilisation at NIHR.</p>

                <p><strong>Dr Deniz Gursul -&nbsp;</strong>Deniz holds a DPhil in neonatal pain and brain imaging from University of Oxford, and gained experience in medical writing before joining the NIHR. She is involved in the selection of papers and ensuring the scientific accuracy of our products.</p>

                <p><strong>Martha Powell -&nbsp;</strong>Martha is in the communications team at NIHR, working to ensure that the products we produce around research findings reach the people who can act on them. Prior to joining NIHR Martha worked in scientific publishing, both on traditional journals and writing articles for their websites.</p>

                <p><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Hannah Cochrane</strong> - is a Knowledge Specialist Librarian at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust (UHBW) Knowledge and Library Service. A key focus of her job is to support and facilitate the mobilisation of knowledge at UHBW. This is a really exciting project which has seen the development of several KM initiatives such as a regular Forum, Knowledge Capture Interviews, a quarterly Randomised Coffee Trial and tailored support for the Internationally Educated Nurses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                <p>She has been in this role for just over a year and finds her work varied and interesting - she is learning all the time! Importantly though, she has seen the value&nbsp;that KM and library services can bring to the organistaion. She is constantly&nbsp;impressed by the work and research that her colleagues do, and feels very lucky to be part of such a great team.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Helen Watts</strong> - she&nbsp;qualified as a librarian in 2004 having previously worked as a library assistant in a large public library and as a school librarian since 1988. Whilst working as a library assistant and bringing up a young family Helen undertook a degree with the Open University and then a Masters at Bristol University. Helen’s first qualified role was working across two NHS Trusts delivering library services to staff working in the Mental Health sector. After working in this role for 11 years, Helen became the Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Trust library and knowledge services manager in 2016. Drawn to a career in libraries by a love of books and information, equality and helping people, expectations of having an interesting job have been realised and Helen appreciates the variety of people and work that working in the NHS affords where no two days are ever the same. Highlights of her career so far have been collaborating on a Living Library Project with University of the West of England in 2018 and with Bristol Public libraries, United Hospital Bristol &amp; Weston and North Bristol Trust in 2019 and getting a positive interview onto local BBC media about AWP mental Health Trust following that project.</p>

                <p>The Living Library lightening talk will give a basic overview of what happens during an LL, how to prepare and discuss the benefits as to why library services should undertake this type of engagement activity.&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>Pippa Orr</strong> - Pippa will talk about how her Library and Knowledge Service contributes to sustainable healthcare in the North East and north Cumbria, as part of Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust (CNTW), a large Mental Health and Learning Disability Trust stretching from West to East coast.</p>

                <p>She was brought up in South Lakes, with regular trips into the Lake District fells, but didn’t appreciate until years later how important the natural world is to all of us. Whilst living in London,&nbsp; she volunteered with the successful Campaign for Lead Free Air (CLEAR) in the 1980s, leading to the introduction of unleaded petrol.</p>

                <p><strong>Tilly Dixon</strong> -&nbsp; is a Digital Librarian at Mid Cheshire Hospitals Foundation Trust. Tilly is relatively new to the NHS, having worked previously as an IT Consultant for several multi-national corporations. Her interests are digital literacy, knowledge mobilisation, and building our future digital workforce. She volunteers at her local library offering IT and family history research support.</p>

                <p><strong>Jess Pawley </strong>- is the Knowledge and Evidence Specialist for Quality Improvement at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, a role she has held for just over 3 years after having worked her way up via library assistant and clinical librarian. She is part of the national Evidence 4 Quality Improvement (E4QI) community of practice, and during the pandemic was seconded to NHS England where she helped establish a knowledge management and evidence service for the COVID-19 Behaviour Change Unit. She is a mentor for CILIP and is working (slowly) on Knowledge Management Chartership.</p>

                <p>Outside of work she can be found at the swimming pool before most normal people are awake, and generally finds it very hard to spend any length of time sitting still.</p>

                <p><strong>Helen Swales</strong> -&nbsp;Helen started her career at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, before moving into Health Libraries in 1996.&nbsp; After two years at Bradford Royal Infirmary she took on the role of Librarian for Leeds Health Authority, and after various organisational restructures, is now Library Services Manager for Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, managing delivery of the library service for all LCH staff across Leeds and also via Service Level Agreements delivery of library services to primary care in Leeds and public health staff in Leeds City Council.&nbsp;Helen also chairs the city-wide Project Team for improving access to health library services in Leeds, with specific responsibility for service development.</p>

                <p><strong>Jenny Emmel</strong> -&nbsp;<span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Jenny began her career in London public libraries, before moving to Leeds in 2005, to take up a role at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">Jenny is the Corporate Support Librarian, a job role she shares with Beth Tapster.&nbsp; In this role she specifically focuses on supporting the information needs of non-clinical staff and nurses by providing evidence searches and training.&nbsp; She also administers the library management system and website, both of which are multi-organisation systems shared by the three Leeds NHS Trusts and the Public Health Resource Centre.</span></span></p>

                <p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"><strong>Sarah Stones</strong> -&nbsp;Sarah is currently the Library &amp; Knowledge Services Manager for Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which provides services to the Trust, local CCG, primary care and public health teams. She has worked in health libraries since 1992, starting out as Library and Information Officer for Mid-Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, then as Faculty Team Librarian for the University of Nottingham School of Nursing &amp; Midwifery, before moving to the Library &amp; Knowledge Service at Sherwood Forest Hospitals. Sarah also co-chairs the Nottinghamshire Health Information Forum and has a keen interest in health and wellbeing and health literacy.</span></span></p>

                <p><strong>Time:&nbsp;</strong>10.00 - 11.30</p>

                <p><strong>Description</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Come along to this interactive session to learn more about the research agenda and discuss how research is disseminated as we’re joined by the National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR).&nbsp;</p>

                <p>NIHR funds projects and people to carry out research across health, public health and social care. The findings of this research ends up in academic journals, with thousands of articles being published every year. Open Access policies mean that more and more people can now access those scientific research articles for free. But they’re often lengthy and full of technical language making them difficult to understand.</p>

                <p><a style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline" href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR Evidence</a> aims to make the findings of the research they fund and support more accessible and understandable. They are also exploring innovative ways to get research findings in front of the people who are best-placed to use them. For example, exploring the use of Wikipedia, podcasts and infographics to disseminate research.</p>

                <p>As part of this Knowledge cafe, we will be covering:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>NIHR's role as a funder in disseminating knowledge</li>
                 <li>How NIHR works, what they produce and how it helps research to be understood</li>
                 <li>Some of the innovations they’ve been exploring, including the role of Wikipedia, podcasts, and republishing in known journals</li>
                 <li>What they’ve learnt about adapting what they produce to reach different audiences</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We will then have a chance to discuss different ways to disseminate research, what’s effective, how this relates to your role and how NIHR could support NHS knowledge and library service staff in the future. This will include discussion questions including:</p>

                <ul>
                 <li>Do plain English summaries of research evidence make a difference to how research is used?</li>
                 <li>How could NIHR outputs help you mobilise knowledge to your users?</li>
                </ul>

            <h2><strong>What is a Development Plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>During the review, required actions to address areas for development were identified.</p>

            <p>The development plan is the new name for an action plan, it is required to show how any areas for development are being addressed by the organisation.</p>

            <p>The name of the plan has been changed, from action plan to development plan, to align with the requirements of the NHS Education Contract, schedule 1, section 14.7.</p>

            <h2><strong>Do all organisations need to submit a development plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>Any actions required to address areas for development are set out in the September 2022 Baseline Report for the organisation.</p>

            <p>These are included in the section titled 'Required Actions and Recommendations for Service Improvement.'</p>

            <h2><strong>When do I need to submit my Development Plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>If an organisation is required to produce a development plan this needs to be submitted by 16&nbsp;January 2023.</p>

            <p>The development plan needs to be sent to the Knowledge for Healthcare team on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

            <p>Organisations can submit the development plan at any point up to 16&nbsp;January 2023.</p>

            <p>If you have already submitted an action plan, you do not need to submit a development plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>How is a Service Improvement Plan different from a Development Plan? </strong></h2>

            <p>A service improvement plan sets out the strategic steps the organisation will take to demonstrate progress in line with the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.</p>

            <p>Service improvement planning by organisations for knowledge and library services is an integral requirement of the NHS Education Contract, see schedule 1 section 14.6.&nbsp; All organisations with an NHS Education Contract will require a service improvement plan for knowledge and library services.</p>

            <p>It will be helpful for an organisation’s service improvement plan to include how it will address any recommendations made in the Outcomes Framework detailed report, as sent to the knowledge and library service manager.</p>

            <p>See FAQs on Service Improvement Review and Service Improvement Plan for more detail.</p>

            <h2><strong>Can I request a copy of the national and/or regional baseline graphic to use in other reports?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes, please get in touch with your regional team contact.</p>

            <h2><strong>Can we have a copy of the national baseline graphic set out by organisation type?</strong></h2>

            <p>These are currently in development. We will notify knowledge and library service managers once these have been created</p>

            <h2><strong>Will the good practice and innovation identified be shared?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes, we will actively encourage local services to share the learning, good practice and innovation identified through the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework baseline assessment.&nbsp; This will include, sharing through knowledge and library service manager meetings, blogs and podcasts, facilitating platforms for organisations to share and a national knowledge and library service event in 2023.</p>

            <h2><strong>Who is the baseline report being shared with?</strong></h2>

            <p>The report is going to the KLS Manager, where in post. Where there is no KLS Manager in post, then the report is going to a named contact in the NHS organisation. Where there is a new KLS in development, then the report is going to the named contact.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is the baseline report not being shared with Chief Executives?</strong></h2>

            <p>Listening to the feedback from knowledge and library services we are no longer sharing the baseline report from HEE with organisation senior managers and Chief Executives on this occasion.&nbsp; The report has however been written with senior stakeholders in mind so that it is in a format you can share with an organisation.&nbsp; Please do take time to review the new baseline report, consider how you might share this within an organisation to support development plans and future service improvement plans.</p>

          hippostd:content: |-
            <h2><strong>Is the baseline consistent and accurate when not all organisations have submitted additional evidence?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Throughout the extended period, with the opportunity for organisations to submit additional evidence, we have worked towards ensuring a consistent approach to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The same validation approach and principles were applied to the review of the additional evidence submitted, please see the FAQ on how the submission of additional evidence was validated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The baseline is focused on narrative and evidence of activity undertaken by organisations and knowledge and library services during 2020-21(2019-20 where Covid had resulted in services/activity being postponed) to ensure it is comparable across the country.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>What was involved in the validation process for submissions of additional evidence?</strong></h2>

            <p>The validation process was the same as that carried out for the initial submissions:</p>

            <p>A consistent national process based on the learning from undertaking the pilot of 12 services in 2018:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>the validation review was conducted using the guidance and principles in the validation section of the Framework Handbook, and the Evidence and Outcome Levels section of FAQs</li>
             <li>the validation was based solely on the narrative and all supporting evidence provided in the return</li>
             <li>each self-evaluation was reviewed by two validators to ensure consistency</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The validation for each self-evaluation was undertaken in two stages:&nbsp;</p>

            <ol>
             <li>An individual review of the submission documentation and evidence.</li>
             <li>A meeting at which the validators discussed and reviewed their findings for each of the outcomes, agreed validated levels and compiled both the detailed and baseline report.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul style="margin-left:40px">
             <li>where queries arose, the validators escalated these to the national consistency panel</li>
             <li>throughout the validation consistency processes were put in place. These included sampling reports and validation decisions to ensure a consistent approach</li>
             <li>all baseline reports were reviewed to ensure consistency</li>
            </ul>

          hippostd:content: |-
            <h2><strong>Why are organisations asked to submit a self-evaluation using the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework for Knowledge and Library Services?</strong></h2>

            <p>Health Education England (HEE) is responsible for ensuring that the NHS, its staff and learners in England have access to high-quality education and learning environments. HEE seeks assurance that organisations are enabling knowledge and library services to develop in line with <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare</a> and HEE’s <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.nhs.uk/staff-learners-and-employers/policy/">Knowledge and Library Services Policies</a>, and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/quality">HEE’s Quality Strategy and Framework</a>. &nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Are you planning to review the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework assessment process?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes. Health Education England regularly reviews all our quality assurance processes. We have listened to feedback from knowledge and library services and the national Quality Team to inform the approach going forward.&nbsp; The aim is to simplify and streamline documentation and processes using the following principles:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>supporting the NHS to bring benefits to organisations, the workforce and through them to patients</li>
             <li>achievable and sustainable for NHS organisations, NHS knowledge and library services and validators</li>
             <li>aligned and proportionate to the quality processes for organisations in receipt of NHS Education Contract funding</li>
             <li>supportive of service improvement and development</li>
             <li>enabling active engagement and good working relationships with a nominated development lead identified for each organisation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>How will you work with organisations to continually improve knowledge and library services over the next few years? </strong></h2>

            <p>On 30 August 2022, the Knowledge for Healthcare Board approved the adoption of a 2-year cycle of Service Improvement Reviews for a minimum of the next four years, until 2026/27.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="implementing-the-2023-4-qiof">Implementing the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework from 2023/4</a>. &nbsp;The aim is to focus is on working with organisations and knowledge and library service teams.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will organisations with an Education Contract next be asked to submit a full self-evaluation of the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework?</strong></h2>

            <p>Organisations will not be asked to submit a full self-evaluation using the Outcomes Framework before 2027/28.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework change?</strong></h2>

            <p>Work begins in September 2022, to revise the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework. We will seek input from service managers as this work progresses. The revision of the Outcomes Framework will inform the service improvement review process and the template of the associated Service Improvement Plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will the service improvement reviews begin?</strong></h2>

            <p>The service improvement reviews will start from April 2023, and run for a minimum of four years to 2026/27.</p>

            <h2><strong>What will be involved in a Service Improvement Review?</strong></h2>

            <p>From April 2023, a biennial service improvement review will be introduced, meaning a review of 50% organisations in each year. The review will involve a discussion focused on:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>recent service improvements</li>
             <li>the plan for future development</li>
             <li>any risks and concerns with which the team may be able to help</li>
             <li>identifying good practice to celebrate and share with other knowledge services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>What documentation will the organisation need to submit for the Service Improvement Review?</strong></h2>

            <p>In preparation for the review discussion, each organisation will be asked to provide:</p>

            <ol>
             <li>A Service Improvement Plan for the knowledge and library service as per the <a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract">NHS Education Contract</a> (Schedule 1; 14.6).</li>
             <li>The most recent Knowledge and Library Service Annual Report.</li>
             <li>Any Service Level Agreements, where applicable.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2><strong>For the service improvement review do you require an annual report for the preceding year?</strong></h2>

            <p>Only if this is available and has been produced before the required submission date.&nbsp; The most recent annual report for the knowledge and library service should be submitted.</p>

            <h2><strong>Will all organisations have a service improvement review discussion in 2023/24?</strong></h2>

            <p>Reviews will be undertaken with 50% of organisations with an Education Contract in each year, beginning with 50% having review discussions in 2023/24.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will organisations having a service improvement review in 2024/25 be informed?</strong></h2>

            <p>Each organisation will be informed, by March 2023, regarding which year, either 2023/24 or 2024/25, the service improvement review will take place.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will HEE decide which organisations will have a review in 2023/24. </strong></h2>

            <p>This has not yet been decided. The Knowledge for Healthcare Board is to consider whether to ‘cluster’ reviews, for example by geography or by type of organisation.</p>

            <p>However, in the first instance knowledge and library services will have an opportunity to express interest in being an early adopter.</p>

            <h2><strong>Will the service improvement review include a visit to the library?</strong></h2>

            <p>The service improvement review will include a discussion with the organisation and the knowledge and library service manager.&nbsp; Although visits to knowledge and library services will take place over the four-year period, 2023/24 to 2026/27, it is like that most service improvement review discussions will take place virtually.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will I know when my organisation(s) review will take place?</strong></h2>

            <p>The regional knowledge and library services team will be in touch with all organisations with an Education Contract before the end of March 2023, to arrange the date of the review meeting and to agree the date by which documents are needed.</p>

            <h2><strong>Who should I work with in my organisation?</strong></h2>

            <p>We would recommend you work with senior colleagues, the named contact on your Board, Head of Education and anyone else in your organisation you involve in service planning.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why has this service improvement review approach been put in place?</strong></h2>

            <p>This change is partly in response to feedback after the self-evaluation submission for the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework and partly informed by a review of the baseline data. This approach provides time for organisations and knowledge and library services to work together on service improvement.</p>

            <p>The quality assurance process for libraries is fully integrated into HEE’s quality processes as part of the HEE Quality Framework. Taking a joined-up approach, the requirement for a Service Improvement Plan for knowledge and library services in the NHS Education Contract is reflected in the “ask” in the annual self-assessment survey, issued by regional HEE Quality teams to organisations.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does the Education Contract say about Service Improvement Plans?</strong></h2>

            <p>'The Placement Provider will ensure progression through the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework maturity model levels for all outcomes. The Placement Provider will ensure that there is an agreed and implemented Service Improvement Plan in place for the knowledge and library service. This plan is required to reflect the requirements of The Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.'&nbsp;<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract">The Education Contract</a> Schedule 1; 14.6</p>

            <h2><strong>What format will organisations need to use for a Service Improvement Plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>A new Service Improvement Plan template will be developed, based on the revision to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework. &nbsp;The Service Improvement Plan should align to your organisation’s strategic plans as well as the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.&nbsp; The baseline report and recommendations to the organisation can be used to assist in informing the plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will the Service Improvement Plan link to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework?</strong></h2>

            <p>The Service Improvement Plan will reflect the updated Framework, revised to align with the six Outcomes.</p>

            <h2><strong>What can I do now to prepare for the service improvement approach?</strong></h2>

            <p>To start preparing for a service improvement review you may find it helpful to:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>review the recommendations in your baseline and detailed​ Quality and Improvement Outcomes Report</li>
             <li>Make sure you are producing an annual report</li>
             <li>Make sure that any your Service level Agreements are up to date and signed.</li>

            <p>The name of the plan has been changed, from action plan to development plan, to align with the requirements of the NHS Education Contract, schedule 1, section 14.7.</p>

            <h2><strong>Do all organisations need to submit a development plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>Any actions required to address areas for development are set out in the September 2022 Baseline Report for the organisation.</p>

            <p>These are included in the section titled 'Required Actions and Recommendations for Service Improvement.'</p>

            <h2><strong>When do I need to submit my Development Plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>If an organisation is required to produce a development plan this needs to be submitted by 16&nbsp;January 2023.</p>

            <p>The development plan needs to be sent to the Knowledge for Healthcare team on&nbsp;<a href="mailto:kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk">kfh.england@hee.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

            <p>Organisations can submit the development plan at any point up to 16&nbsp;January 2023.</p>

            <p>If you have already submitted an action plan, you do not need to submit a development plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>How is a Service Improvement Plan different from a Development Plan? </strong></h2>

            <p>A service improvement plan sets out the strategic steps the organisation will take to demonstrate progress in line with the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.</p>

            <p>Service improvement planning by organisations for knowledge and library services is an integral requirement of the NHS Education Contract, see schedule 1 section 14.6.&nbsp; All organisations with an NHS Education Contract will require a service improvement plan for knowledge and library services.</p>

            <p>It will be helpful for an organisation’s service improvement plan to include how it will address any recommendations made in the Outcomes Framework detailed report, as sent to the knowledge and library service manager.</p>

            <p>See FAQs on Service Improvement Review and Service Improvement Plan for more detail.</p>

            <h2><strong>Can I request a copy of the national and/or regional baseline graphic to use in other reports?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes, please get in touch with your regional team contact.</p>

            <h2><strong>Can we have a copy of the national baseline graphic set out by organisation type?</strong></h2>

            <p>These are currently in development. We will notify knowledge and library service managers once these have been created</p>

            <h2><strong>Will the good practice and innovation identified be shared?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes, we will actively encourage local services to share the learning, good practice and innovation identified through the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework baseline assessment.&nbsp; This will include, sharing through knowledge and library service manager meetings, blogs and podcasts, facilitating platforms for organisations to share and a national knowledge and library service event in 2023.</p>

            <h2><strong>Who is the baseline report being shared with?</strong></h2>

            <p>The report is going to the KLS Manager, where in post. Where there is no KLS Manager in post, then the report is going to a named contact in the NHS organisation. Where there is a new KLS in development, then the report is going to the named contact.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is the baseline report not being shared with Chief Executives?</strong></h2>

            <p>Listening to the feedback from knowledge and library services we are no longer sharing the baseline report from HEE with organisation senior managers and Chief Executives on this occasion.&nbsp; The report has however been written with senior stakeholders in mind so that it is in a format you can share with an organisation.&nbsp; Please do take time to review the new baseline report, consider how you might share this within an organisation to support development plans and future service improvement plans.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why are organisations asked to submit a self-evaluation using the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework for Knowledge and Library Services?</strong></h2>

            <p>Health Education England (HEE) is responsible for ensuring that the NHS, its staff and learners in England have access to high-quality education and learning environments. HEE seeks assurance that organisations are enabling knowledge and library services to develop in line with <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare</a> and HEE’s <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.nhs.uk/staff-learners-and-employers/policy/">Knowledge and Library Services Policies</a>, and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/quality">HEE’s Quality Strategy and Framework</a>. &nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Are you planning to review the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework assessment process?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes. Health Education England regularly reviews all our quality assurance processes. We have listened to feedback from knowledge and library services and the national Quality Team to inform the approach going forward.&nbsp; The aim is to simplify and streamline documentation and processes using the following principles:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>supporting the NHS to bring benefits to organisations, the workforce and through them to patients</li>
             <li>achievable and sustainable for NHS organisations, NHS knowledge and library services and validators</li>
             <li>aligned and proportionate to the quality processes for organisations in receipt of NHS Education Contract funding</li>
             <li>supportive of service improvement and development</li>
             <li>enabling active engagement and good working relationships with a nominated development lead identified for each organisation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>How will you work with organisations to continually improve knowledge and library services over the next few years? </strong></h2>

            <p>On 30 August 2022, the Knowledge for Healthcare Board approved the adoption of a 2-year cycle of Service Improvement Reviews for a minimum of the next four years, until 2026/27.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="implementing-the-2023-4-qiof">Implementing the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework from 2023/4</a>. &nbsp;The aim is to focus is on working with organisations and knowledge and library service teams.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will organisations with an Education Contract next be asked to submit a full self-evaluation of the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework?</strong></h2>

            <p>Organisations will not be asked to submit a full self-evaluation using the Outcomes Framework before 2027/28.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework change?</strong></h2>

            <p>Work begins in September 2022, to revise the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework. We will seek input from service managers as this work progresses. The revision of the Outcomes Framework will inform the service improvement review process and the template of the associated Service Improvement Plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will the service improvement reviews begin?</strong></h2>

            <p>The service improvement reviews will start from April 2023, and run for a minimum of four years to 2026/27.</p>

            <h2><strong>What will be involved in a Service Improvement Review?</strong></h2>

            <p>From April 2023, a biennial service improvement review will be introduced, meaning a review of 50% organisations in each year. The review will involve a discussion focused on:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>recent service improvements</li>
             <li>the plan for future development</li>
             <li>any risks and concerns with which the team may be able to help</li>
             <li>identifying good practice to celebrate and share with other knowledge services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>What documentation will the organisation need to submit for the Service Improvement Review?</strong></h2>

            <p>In preparation for the review discussion, each organisation will be asked to provide:</p>

            <ol>
             <li>A Service Improvement Plan for the knowledge and library service as per the <a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract">NHS Education Contract</a> (Schedule 1; 14.6).</li>
             <li>The most recent Knowledge and Library Service Annual Report.</li>
             <li>Any Service Level Agreements, where applicable.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2><strong>For the service improvement review do you require an annual report for the preceding year?</strong></h2>

            <p>Only if this is available and has been produced before the required submission date.&nbsp; The most recent annual report for the knowledge and library service should be submitted.</p>

            <h2><strong>Will all organisations have a service improvement review discussion in 2023/24?</strong></h2>

            <p>Reviews will be undertaken with 50% of organisations with an Education Contract in each year, beginning with 50% having review discussions in 2023/24.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will organisations having a service improvement review in 2024/25 be informed?</strong></h2>

            <p>Each organisation will be informed, by March 2023, regarding which year, either 2023/24 or 2024/25, the service improvement review will take place.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will HEE decide which organisations will have a review in 2023/24. </strong></h2>

            <p>This has not yet been decided. The Knowledge for Healthcare Board is to consider whether to ‘cluster’ reviews, for example by geography or by type of organisation.</p>

            <p>However, in the first instance knowledge and library services will have an opportunity to express interest in being an early adopter.</p>

            <h2><strong>Will the service improvement review include a visit to the library?</strong></h2>

            <p>The service improvement review will include a discussion with the organisation and the knowledge and library service manager.&nbsp; Although visits to knowledge and library services will take place over the four-year period, 2023/24 to 2026/27, it is like that most service improvement review discussions will take place virtually.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will I know when my organisation(s) review will take place?</strong></h2>

            <p>The regional knowledge and library services team will be in touch with all organisations with an Education Contract before the end of March 2023, to arrange the date of the review meeting and to agree the date by which documents are needed.</p>

            <h2><strong>Who should I work with in my organisation?</strong></h2>

            <p>We would recommend you work with senior colleagues, the named contact on your Board, Head of Education and anyone else in your organisation you involve in service planning.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why has this service improvement review approach been put in place?</strong></h2>

            <p>This change is partly in response to feedback after the self-evaluation submission for the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework and partly informed by a review of the baseline data. This approach provides time for organisations and knowledge and library services to work together on service improvement.</p>

            <p>The quality assurance process for libraries is fully integrated into HEE’s quality processes as part of the HEE Quality Framework. Taking a joined-up approach, the requirement for a Service Improvement Plan for knowledge and library services in the NHS Education Contract is reflected in the “ask” in the annual self-assessment survey, issued by regional HEE Quality teams to organisations.</p>

            <p>'The Placement Provider will ensure progression through the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework maturity model levels for all outcomes. The Placement Provider will ensure that there is an agreed and implemented Service Improvement Plan in place for the knowledge and library service. This plan is required to reflect the requirements of The Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.'&nbsp;<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract">The Education Contract</a> Schedule 1; 14.6</p>

            <h2><strong>What format will organisations need to use for a Service Improvement Plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>A new Service Improvement Plan template will be developed, based on the revision to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework. &nbsp;The Service Improvement Plan should align to your organisation’s strategic plans as well as the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.&nbsp; The baseline report and recommendations to the organisation can be used to assist in informing the plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will the Service Improvement Plan link to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework?</strong></h2>

            <p>The Service Improvement Plan will reflect the updated Framework, revised to align with the six Outcomes.</p>

            <h2><strong>What can I do now to prepare for the service improvement approach?</strong></h2>

            <p>To start preparing for a service improvement review you may find it helpful to:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>review the recommendations in your baseline and detailed​ Quality and Improvement Outcomes Report</li>
             <li>Make sure you are producing an annual report</li>
             <li>Make sure that any your Service level Agreements are up to date and signed.</li>

             <li>A meeting at which the validators discussed and reviewed their findings for each of the outcomes, agreed validated levels and compiled both the detailed and baseline report.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2><strong>Why are organisations asked to submit a self-evaluation using the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework for Knowledge and Library Services?</strong></h2>

            <p>Health Education England (HEE) is responsible for ensuring that the NHS, its staff and learners in England have access to high-quality education and learning environments. HEE seeks assurance that organisations are enabling knowledge and library services to develop in line with <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/knowledge-for-healthcare">Knowledge for Healthcare</a> and HEE’s <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://library.nhs.uk/staff-learners-and-employers/policy/">Knowledge and Library Services Policies</a>, and <a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/quality">HEE’s Quality Strategy and Framework</a>. &nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Are you planning to review the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework assessment process?</strong></h2>

            <p>Yes. Health Education England regularly reviews all our quality assurance processes. We have listened to feedback from knowledge and library services and the national Quality Team to inform the approach going forward.&nbsp; The aim is to simplify and streamline documentation and processes using the following principles:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>supporting the NHS to bring benefits to organisations, the workforce and through them to patients</li>
             <li>achievable and sustainable for NHS organisations, NHS knowledge and library services and validators</li>
             <li>aligned and proportionate to the quality processes for organisations in receipt of NHS Education Contract funding</li>
             <li>supportive of service improvement and development</li>
             <li>enabling active engagement and good working relationships with a nominated development lead identified for each organisation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>How will you work with organisations to continually improve knowledge and library services over the next few years? </strong></h2>

            <p>On 30 August 2022, the Knowledge for Healthcare Board approved the adoption of a 2-year cycle of Service Improvement Reviews for a minimum of the next four years, until 2026/27.&nbsp; See&nbsp;<a href="implementing-the-2023-4-qiof">Implementing the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework from 2023/4</a>. &nbsp;The aim is to focus is on working with organisations and knowledge and library service teams.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will organisations with an Education Contract next be asked to submit a full self-evaluation of the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework?</strong></h2>

            <p>Organisations will not be asked to submit a full self-evaluation using the Outcomes Framework before 2027/28.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework change?</strong></h2>

            <p>Work begins in September 2022, to revise the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework. We will seek input from service managers as this work progresses. The revision of the Outcomes Framework will inform the service improvement review process and the template of the associated Service Improvement Plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will the service improvement reviews begin?</strong></h2>

            <p>The service improvement reviews will start from April 2023, and run for a minimum of four years to 2026/27.</p>

            <h2><strong>What will be involved in a Service Improvement Review?</strong></h2>

            <p>From April 2023, a biennial service improvement review will be introduced, meaning a review of 50% organisations in each year. The review will involve a discussion focused on:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>recent service improvements</li>
             <li>the plan for future development</li>
             <li>any risks and concerns with which the team may be able to help</li>
             <li>identifying good practice to celebrate and share with other knowledge services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>What documentation will the organisation need to submit for the Service Improvement Review?</strong></h2>

            <p>In preparation for the review discussion, each organisation will be asked to provide:</p>

            <ol>
             <li>A Service Improvement Plan for the knowledge and library service as per the <a href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract">NHS Education Contract</a> (Schedule 1; 14.6).</li>
             <li>The most recent Knowledge and Library Service Annual Report.</li>
             <li>Any Service Level Agreements, where applicable.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2><strong>For the service improvement review do you require an annual report for the preceding year?</strong></h2>

            <p>Only if this is available and has been produced before the required submission date.&nbsp; The most recent annual report for the knowledge and library service should be submitted.</p>

            <h2><strong>Will all organisations have a service improvement review discussion in 2023/24?</strong></h2>

            <p>Reviews will be undertaken with 50% of organisations with an Education Contract in each year, beginning with 50% having review discussions in 2023/24.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will organisations having a service improvement review in 2024/25 be informed?</strong></h2>

            <p>Each organisation will be informed, by March 2023, regarding which year, either 2023/24 or 2024/25, the service improvement review will take place.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will HEE decide which organisations will have a review in 2023/24. </strong></h2>

            <p>This has not yet been decided. The Knowledge for Healthcare Board is to consider whether to ‘cluster’ reviews, for example by geography or by type of organisation.</p>

            <p>However, in the first instance knowledge and library services will have an opportunity to express interest in being an early adopter.</p>

            <h2><strong>Will the service improvement review include a visit to the library?</strong></h2>

            <p>The service improvement review will include a discussion with the organisation and the knowledge and library service manager.&nbsp; Although visits to knowledge and library services will take place over the four-year period, 2023/24 to 2026/27, it is like that most service improvement review discussions will take place virtually.</p>

            <h2><strong>When will I know when my organisation(s) review will take place?</strong></h2>

            <p>The regional knowledge and library services team will be in touch with all organisations with an Education Contract before the end of March 2023, to arrange the date of the review meeting and to agree the date by which documents are needed.</p>

            <h2><strong>Who should I work with in my organisation?</strong></h2>

            <p>We would recommend you work with senior colleagues, the named contact on your Board, Head of Education and anyone else in your organisation you involve in service planning.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why has this service improvement review approach been put in place?</strong></h2>

            <p>This change is partly in response to feedback after the self-evaluation submission for the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework and partly informed by a review of the baseline data. This approach provides time for organisations and knowledge and library services to work together on service improvement.</p>

            <p>The quality assurance process for libraries is fully integrated into HEE’s quality processes as part of the HEE Quality Framework. Taking a joined-up approach, the requirement for a Service Improvement Plan for knowledge and library services in the NHS Education Contract is reflected in the “ask” in the annual self-assessment survey, issued by regional HEE Quality teams to organisations.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does the Education Contract say about Service Improvement Plans?</strong></h2>

            <p>'The Placement Provider will ensure progression through the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework maturity model levels for all outcomes. The Placement Provider will ensure that there is an agreed and implemented Service Improvement Plan in place for the knowledge and library service. This plan is required to reflect the requirements of The Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.'&nbsp;<a style="color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.hee.nhs.uk/our-work/new-nhs-education-contract">The Education Contract</a> Schedule 1; 14.6</p>

            <h2><strong>What format will organisations need to use for a Service Improvement Plan?</strong></h2>

            <p>A new Service Improvement Plan template will be developed, based on the revision to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework. &nbsp;The Service Improvement Plan should align to your organisation’s strategic plans as well as the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework.&nbsp; The baseline report and recommendations to the organisation can be used to assist in informing the plan.</p>

            <h2><strong>How will the Service Improvement Plan link to the Quality and Improvement Outcomes Framework?</strong></h2>

            <p>The Service Improvement Plan will reflect the updated Framework, revised to align with the six Outcomes.</p>

            <h2><strong>What can I do now to prepare for the service improvement approach?</strong></h2>

            <p>To start preparing for a service improvement review you may find it helpful to:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>review the recommendations in your baseline and detailed​ Quality and Improvement Outcomes Report</li>
             <li>Make sure you are producing an annual report</li>
             <li>Make sure that any your Service level Agreements are up to date and signed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Metric definition</h2>

            <p>Number of active users on OpenAthens in a month.</p>

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

            <ul>
             <li>can show users are aware and engaged with services</li>
             <li>shows meaningful activity to funders</li>
             <li>simple to collect in an area of high investment so demonstrate value for money for electronic resources</li>
             <li>active users shows breadth of engagement</li>
             <li>usage data counts in OpenAthens can be quite variable and feel less reliable than “has someone used something in a time period or not”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process for compiling the metric</h2>

            <ol>
             <li>Generate report for required period in OpenAthens admin­.</li>
             <li>In the data explorer select accounts, authentications and&nbsp;then set granularity to monthly.</li>
             <li>Select start and end date of the month you want.</li>
             <li>You can then see the Successful unique authentications.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>What does it mean?</h2>

            <p>Compare performance during different time periods:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>month versus equivalent month in previous years</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
             <li>pre and post promotion</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Potential to benchmark against equivalent organisations.</p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>

            <ul>
             <li>changing staffing within the Trust</li>
             <li>IP enabled resources not captured</li>
             <li>not able to choose a period longer than a month</li>
             <li>figures not consistent with equivalent metric pre September 2018 no longer supported by OpenAthens</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Desired outcomes</h2>

            <p>Increase number of active users versus equivalent periods.</p>

            <h2>Improvement plans</h2>

            <p>Promotional work.&nbsp; Potential to use activity date by resource or user type to target this.</p>

            <h2>Reporting</h2>

            <p>Include in quarterly stats reports to library user boards. Include in annual reports.</p>

            <p>North West Ambulance Service LKS, <a href="mailto:Matt.Holland@nwas.nhs.uk?subject=Metrics">Matt Holland</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Ratio of OpenAthens accesses to resources per headcount.</p>

            <p>The number of OpenAthens accesses to available resources in a given period divided by the Trust headcount.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For example, for January 2017 using NWAS knowledge and library services (KLS) data, the calculation is 247 (OpenAthens accesses)&nbsp;/ 5856 (NWAS headcount) = 0.04</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Open Athens accesses are impacted by all library activities to drive up the use of eresources. Where these are embedded in the library strategy and the marketing and are effectively implemented the ratio should be positively affected. The metric provides a simple number to evidence success (or lack of it).</p>

            <h2><strong>Strategies and plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Achieving a higher resource utilisation, evidenced by the ratio, could be a strategic objective in the KLS strategy and marketing plan.</p>

            <h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

            <p>The audiences are those external to the library including, other NHS health care library managers, Trust managers and other external stakeholders.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Data sources</strong></h3>

            <p>The total number of Open Athens accesses to resources can be sourced from the OpenAthens administrative statistics module.&nbsp; From the OpenAthens administrators dashboard for statistics, generate a report for required period.</p>

            <p>Select the options,<em>&nbsp;'</em>Total usage for all accounts at this level' and 'Usage total for all resources.'&nbsp; Choose a start and end date. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Typically, you can record the number for each month for a monthly presentation and for the previous twelve months for an annual percentage.</p>

            <p>The number of employees is sourced from NHS Digital's 'Workforce Statistics.'&nbsp; All things being equal the headcount will not change significantly over time.</p>

            <p>You have the option for an annual ratio of taking the last headcount for the year you are calculating the ratio for or averaging the headcount over the previous 12 months. Be sure to make clear how the number you used was derived.</p>

            <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>

            <p>Problems inherent in compiling OpenAthens accesses apply to this metric. Different profiles of use by your Trust staff will deliver the same ratio; a few super users can generate the same number of accesses as a larger number of infrequent users.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The number of resources you provide access to and how you provide access will also influence the ratio.&nbsp; While it is possible to compare with other Trusts, caution should be exercised.</p>

            <h3><strong>Frequency</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric can be repeated monthly or annually.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>This metric gives a single measure of how active Trust staff are in using eresources.&nbsp; It provides a useful indication of how successful promotion of eresources is in affecting usage by library users. It is a useful complement to the 'Percentage of NHS Open Athens Accounts to Headcount'<em>.</em>&nbsp; See also <a href="https://lihnnclinicallibs.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/a-note-on-open-athens-statistics-by-matt-holland/">A note on Open Athens Statistics</a> for a further explanation.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Improvement would be raising the ratio month on month or year on year.&nbsp; If it is available the ratio can be compared to a regional average ration. An average is available for the North West region.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Improvement in the ratio is the effect of the whole library effort (training, promotion, current awareness services etc. ) to promote us of eresources to users.&nbsp; Effective promotion of eresources should cause an increase in the ratio over time.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Percentage of NHS OpenAthens accounts to headcount.</p>

            <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric uses NHS Open Athens as a proxy for user engagement to estimate the percentage of trust staff (FTE) who are<em>&nbsp;potentially</em>&nbsp;engaged with the Library and its eResources.</p>

            <p>Calculate by (Number of Accounts / Headcount) * 100. For example, (2000 / 5000) * 100 = 40%</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Strategies and plans</strong></h3>

            <p>Achieving a higher penetration of NHS OpenAthens accounts can be a strategic objective in the knowledge and library services (KLS) strategy and marketing plan.</p>

            <h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

            <p>The audiences are those external to the library including, other NHS health care library managers, Trust managers and other external stakeholders.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the Metric</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Data Sources</strong></h3>

            <p>The number of NHS Open Athens Accounts can be sourced from the front page of the Open Athens Administrative module. Typically, you can record the number on the first of the month for a monthly presentation and an average of the previous 12 months for an annual percentage.</p>

            <p>For the annual percentage figure, you might also take the last recorded number for the period reported, e.g. 1 April each year. Be sure to make clear how the number you used was derived.</p>

            <p>The number of employees is sourced from NHS Digital's 'Workforce Statistics.'&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>

            <p>Trusts have different strategies for registering staff:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>staff may elect to have NHS OpenAthens accounts or be given them on contacting the library</li>
             <li>staff may be given an account on joining the Trust. &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Either strategy will effect the statistics and their comparability with other Trusts.&nbsp; Another limitation is the imperfect match between accounts and current staff.&nbsp; For example, unexpired accounts still on the system for staff who have left your organisation.</p>

            <p>If you can identify a specific group of staff who have OpenAthens accounts, such as doctors, and a comparable headcount you can run this metric for these discrete groups.</p>

            <h3><strong>Frequency</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric can be repeated monthly or annually.</p>

            <h3><strong>Repeatability</strong></h3>

            <p>Any NHS Trust can create this metric.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>This is a simple, easy to understand metric.&nbsp; Broadly the more NHS OpenAthens registrations, the more Trust staff have engaged with the library, at least registering for an account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For services without a physical library such as NWAS KLS, this is a useful measure of activity where other measures, for example physical visits to the library, are not available.&nbsp;&nbsp; See also&nbsp;<a href="https://lihnnclinicallibs.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/a-note-on-open-athens-statistics-by-matt-holland/">A note on Open Athens Statistics</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>This metric works best against a benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, setting a benchmark to say 25% of Trust members will have registered for an NHS OpenAthens account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Achieving this benchmark or consistently exceeding it provides a measure against which to assess improvement.&nbsp; NWAS KLS sets a benchmark of 25%.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Raising the percentage of OpenAthens registrations is an objective in the NWAS KLS strategy. The means to achieve it are set out in the NWAS KLS marketing plan and the metric is reported in the monthly dashboard.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Messages about OpenAthens are included in all the libraries communications, article in newsletters, meeting with students and with those running internal courses.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The whole effort is aimed at a year on year increase in OpenAthens registrations and/or to exceed the benchmark of 25% of staff registered.</p>

            <p>Brighton and Sussex NHS Trust, <a href="mailto:ben.skinner@bsuh.nhs.uk?subject=Metrics">Ben Skinner</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Proportion of members registered for KnowledgeShare targeted evidence updates who receive at least one email in three months.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Qualitative feedback shows that receiving regular KnowledgeShare evidence updates informs patient care and service decisions, research and education.</p>

            <p>The number of emails received varies for each recipient in relation to their own professional interests and the coverage of content in KnowledgeShare.</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare is an expenditure, which includes a small amount of staff time for categorising members’ interests – this must be shown to be a good use of resources.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <p>KnowledgeShare provides data quarterly showing all members who have signed up for targeted updates and how many emails each member has received in that time (called “FinalReportMembersCurrentAwareness”).</p>

            <p>Using the Excel filter function, filter out those members who have been added to the system fewer than three months ago.&nbsp; Excel displays how many remain.</p>

            <p>Next, filter out those members who have received zero emails. Excel displays how many remain.</p>

            <p>Calculate the proportion by dividing the second number by the first; this will be the proportion of members registered for more than three months that have received at least one email.</p>

            <p>Changes to this proportion can be plotted quarterly.</p>

            <p>NB. One can also calculate the average number of emails that members have received in this time period.&nbsp; However, this is made less useful by the fact that members can choose the frequency with which they receive emails.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>The metric indicates whether KnowledgeShare is successfully delivering targeted evidence updates to your members.</p>

            <p>For those members who do not receive emails it may be because:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>their professional interests have been set up too narrowly on the system and should be adjusted</li>
             <li>there is not sufficient content delivered through KnowledgeShare in their areas of interest (or both)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Ideally 100% of members would receive an email once per quarter but there are likely to be those whose interests are extremely niche, with little published evidence, who will receive relatively little content.</p>

            <p>Suggested bandings would be:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>green = 95%-100%</li>
             <li>amber = 85%-94%</li>
             <li>red = 0%-84%</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Check individual members who are not receiving many updates.&nbsp; Have they been categorised correctly? Can their categories be expanded (discuss with them where necessary)?</p>

            <p>Consider whether the amount of content in a particular subject area needs to be increased. What sources would improve this coverage?</p>

            <p>Discuss with suppliers of KnowledgeShare whether your team could offer to add content in this area, or whether there is capacity from another team.</p>

            <p>Proportion of registered knowlerdge and library services (KLS) members who are registered for KnowledgeShare targeted evidence updates.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Qualitative feedback shows that receiving regular KnowledgeShare evidence updates informs patient care and service decisions, research and education.</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare is an expenditure, which must be shown to be a good use of resources.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <p>Figures for number of active (non-expired) registered LKS members can be obtained from the library management system.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare provides data quarterly showing all members who have signed up for targeted updates (called “FinalReportMembersCurrentAwareness”).</p>

            <p>Registered KnowledgeShare members as a proportion of total LKS membership can therefore be determined.</p>

            <p>Changes to this proportion can be plotted quarterly.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>The metric indicates whether KnowledgeShare is providing an extensive targeted evidence update function for your service.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The system is designed to allow the creation of tailored updates for large numbers of members with little effort and so one should be aiming for a significant proportion of total users to be signed up.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Evidence updates will not be needed by some users – e.g. they may be of less use to undergraduates, estates and facilities staff, etc. Sign-up should be user-driven. However, increased promotion is likely to increase the number of recipients.</p>

            <p>An increasing proportion would be expected over the first five years of implementation, with the increase eventually slowing down and stabilising at around 30%-40%.</p>

            <p>Alternatively it would be possible to focus on particular staff groups, e.g. doctors-in-training, for whom one might expect a higher proportion.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Increase promotion of the targeted evidence updates. Ensure that enquiry desk staff are able to promote the benefits when members join the library.</p>

            <h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>

            <p>This could be reported in the KLS annual report.</p>

            <p>North West Ambulance Service LKS, <a href="mailto:Matt.Holland@nwas.nhs.uk?subject=Metrics">Matt Holland</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Ratio of OpenAthens accesses to resources per headcount.</p>

            <p>The number of OpenAthens accesses to available resources in a given period divided by the Trust headcount.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For example, for January 2017 using NWAS knowledge and library services (KLS) data, the calculation is 247 (OpenAthens accesses)&nbsp;/ 5856 (NWAS headcount) = 0.04</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Open Athens accesses are impacted by all library activities to drive up the use of eresources. Where these are embedded in the library strategy and the marketing and are effectively implemented the ratio should be positively affected. The metric provides a simple number to evidence success (or lack of it).</p>

            <h2><strong>Strategies and plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Achieving a higher resource utilisation, evidenced by the ratio, could be a strategic objective in the KLS strategy and marketing plan.</p>

            <h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

            <p>The audiences are those external to the library including, other NHS health care library managers, Trust managers and other external stakeholders.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Data sources</strong></h3>

            <p>The total number of Open Athens accesses to resources can be sourced from the OpenAthens administrative statistics module.&nbsp; From the OpenAthens administrators dashboard for statistics, generate a report for required period.</p>

            <p>Select the options,<em>&nbsp;'</em>Total usage for all accounts at this level' and 'Usage total for all resources.'&nbsp; Choose a start and end date. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Typically, you can record the number for each month for a monthly presentation and for the previous twelve months for an annual percentage.</p>

            <p>The number of employees is sourced from NHS Digital's 'Workforce Statistics.'&nbsp; All things being equal the headcount will not change significantly over time.</p>

            <p>You have the option for an annual ratio of taking the last headcount for the year you are calculating the ratio for or averaging the headcount over the previous 12 months. Be sure to make clear how the number you used was derived.</p>

            <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>

            <p>Problems inherent in compiling OpenAthens accesses apply to this metric. Different profiles of use by your Trust staff will deliver the same ratio; a few super users can generate the same number of accesses as a larger number of infrequent users.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The number of resources you provide access to and how you provide access will also influence the ratio.&nbsp; While it is possible to compare with other Trusts, caution should be exercised.</p>

            <h3><strong>Frequency</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric can be repeated monthly or annually.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>This metric gives a single measure of how active Trust staff are in using eresources.&nbsp; It provides a useful indication of how successful promotion of eresources is in affecting usage by library users. It is a useful complement to the 'Percentage of NHS Open Athens Accounts to Headcount'<em>.</em>&nbsp; See also <a href="https://lihnnclinicallibs.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/a-note-on-open-athens-statistics-by-matt-holland/">A note on Open Athens Statistics</a> for a further explanation.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Improvement would be raising the ratio month on month or year on year.&nbsp; If it is available the ratio can be compared to a regional average ration. An average is available for the North West region.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Improvement in the ratio is the effect of the whole library effort (training, promotion, current awareness services etc. ) to promote us of eresources to users.&nbsp; Effective promotion of eresources should cause an increase in the ratio over time.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Percentage of NHS OpenAthens accounts to headcount.</p>

            <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric uses NHS Open Athens as a proxy for user engagement to estimate the percentage of trust staff (FTE) who are<em>&nbsp;potentially</em>&nbsp;engaged with the Library and its eResources.</p>

            <p>Calculate by (Number of Accounts / Headcount) * 100. For example, (2000 / 5000) * 100 = 40%</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Strategies and plans</strong></h3>

            <p>Achieving a higher penetration of NHS OpenAthens accounts can be a strategic objective in the knowledge and library services (KLS) strategy and marketing plan.</p>

            <h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

            <p>The audiences are those external to the library including, other NHS health care library managers, Trust managers and other external stakeholders.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the Metric</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Data Sources</strong></h3>

            <p>The number of NHS Open Athens Accounts can be sourced from the front page of the Open Athens Administrative module. Typically, you can record the number on the first of the month for a monthly presentation and an average of the previous 12 months for an annual percentage.</p>

            <p>For the annual percentage figure, you might also take the last recorded number for the period reported, e.g. 1 April each year. Be sure to make clear how the number you used was derived.</p>

            <p>The number of employees is sourced from NHS Digital's 'Workforce Statistics.'&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>

            <p>Trusts have different strategies for registering staff:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>staff may elect to have NHS OpenAthens accounts or be given them on contacting the library</li>
             <li>staff may be given an account on joining the Trust. &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Either strategy will effect the statistics and their comparability with other Trusts.&nbsp; Another limitation is the imperfect match between accounts and current staff.&nbsp; For example, unexpired accounts still on the system for staff who have left your organisation.</p>

            <p>If you can identify a specific group of staff who have OpenAthens accounts, such as doctors, and a comparable headcount you can run this metric for these discrete groups.</p>

            <h3><strong>Frequency</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric can be repeated monthly or annually.</p>

            <h3><strong>Repeatability</strong></h3>

            <p>Any NHS Trust can create this metric.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>This is a simple, easy to understand metric.&nbsp; Broadly the more NHS OpenAthens registrations, the more Trust staff have engaged with the library, at least registering for an account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For services without a physical library such as NWAS KLS, this is a useful measure of activity where other measures, for example physical visits to the library, are not available.&nbsp;&nbsp; See also&nbsp;<a href="https://lihnnclinicallibs.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/a-note-on-open-athens-statistics-by-matt-holland/">A note on Open Athens Statistics</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>This metric works best against a benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, setting a benchmark to say 25% of Trust members will have registered for an NHS OpenAthens account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Achieving this benchmark or consistently exceeding it provides a measure against which to assess improvement.&nbsp; NWAS KLS sets a benchmark of 25%.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Raising the percentage of OpenAthens registrations is an objective in the NWAS KLS strategy. The means to achieve it are set out in the NWAS KLS marketing plan and the metric is reported in the monthly dashboard.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Messages about OpenAthens are included in all the libraries communications, article in newsletters, meeting with students and with those running internal courses.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The whole effort is aimed at a year on year increase in OpenAthens registrations and/or to exceed the benchmark of 25% of staff registered.</p>

            <h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>

            <p>Reported on the library monthly dashboard.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Proportion of members registered for KnowledgeShare targeted evidence updates who receive at least one email in three months.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Qualitative feedback shows that receiving regular KnowledgeShare evidence updates informs patient care and service decisions, research and education.</p>

            <p>The number of emails received varies for each recipient in relation to their own professional interests and the coverage of content in KnowledgeShare.</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare is an expenditure, which includes a small amount of staff time for categorising members’ interests – this must be shown to be a good use of resources.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <p>KnowledgeShare provides data quarterly showing all members who have signed up for targeted updates and how many emails each member has received in that time (called “FinalReportMembersCurrentAwareness”).</p>

            <p>Using the Excel filter function, filter out those members who have been added to the system fewer than three months ago.&nbsp; Excel displays how many remain.</p>

            <p>Next, filter out those members who have received zero emails. Excel displays how many remain.</p>

            <p>Calculate the proportion by dividing the second number by the first; this will be the proportion of members registered for more than three months that have received at least one email.</p>

            <p>Changes to this proportion can be plotted quarterly.</p>

            <p>NB. One can also calculate the average number of emails that members have received in this time period.&nbsp; However, this is made less useful by the fact that members can choose the frequency with which they receive emails.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>The metric indicates whether KnowledgeShare is successfully delivering targeted evidence updates to your members.</p>

            <p>For those members who do not receive emails it may be because:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>their professional interests have been set up too narrowly on the system and should be adjusted</li>
             <li>there is not sufficient content delivered through KnowledgeShare in their areas of interest (or both)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Ideally 100% of members would receive an email once per quarter but there are likely to be those whose interests are extremely niche, with little published evidence, who will receive relatively little content.</p>

            <p>Suggested bandings would be:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>green = 95%-100%</li>
             <li>amber = 85%-94%</li>
             <li>red = 0%-84%</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Check individual members who are not receiving many updates.&nbsp; Have they been categorised correctly? Can their categories be expanded (discuss with them where necessary)?</p>

            <p>Consider whether the amount of content in a particular subject area needs to be increased. What sources would improve this coverage?</p>

            <p>Discuss with suppliers of KnowledgeShare whether your team could offer to add content in this area, or whether there is capacity from another team.</p>

            <p>Proportion of registered knowlerdge and library services (KLS) members who are registered for KnowledgeShare targeted evidence updates.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Qualitative feedback shows that receiving regular KnowledgeShare evidence updates informs patient care and service decisions, research and education.</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare is an expenditure, which must be shown to be a good use of resources.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <p>Figures for number of active (non-expired) registered LKS members can be obtained from the library management system.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare provides data quarterly showing all members who have signed up for targeted updates (called “FinalReportMembersCurrentAwareness”).</p>

            <p>Registered KnowledgeShare members as a proportion of total LKS membership can therefore be determined.</p>

            <p>Changes to this proportion can be plotted quarterly.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>The metric indicates whether KnowledgeShare is providing an extensive targeted evidence update function for your service.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The system is designed to allow the creation of tailored updates for large numbers of members with little effort and so one should be aiming for a significant proportion of total users to be signed up.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Evidence updates will not be needed by some users – e.g. they may be of less use to undergraduates, estates and facilities staff, etc. Sign-up should be user-driven. However, increased promotion is likely to increase the number of recipients.</p>

            <p>An increasing proportion would be expected over the first five years of implementation, with the increase eventually slowing down and stabilising at around 30%-40%.</p>

            <p>Alternatively it would be possible to focus on particular staff groups, e.g. doctors-in-training, for whom one might expect a higher proportion.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Increase promotion of the targeted evidence updates. Ensure that enquiry desk staff are able to promote the benefits when members join the library.</p>

            <h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>

            <p>This could be reported in the KLS annual report.</p>

            <p>North West Ambulance Service LKS, <a href="mailto:Matt.Holland@nwas.nhs.uk?subject=Metrics">Matt Holland</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Ratio of OpenAthens accesses to resources per headcount.</p>

            <p>The number of OpenAthens accesses to available resources in a given period divided by the Trust headcount.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For example, for January 2017 using NWAS knowledge and library services (KLS) data, the calculation is 247 (OpenAthens accesses)&nbsp;/ 5856 (NWAS headcount) = 0.04</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Open Athens accesses are impacted by all library activities to drive up the use of eresources. Where these are embedded in the library strategy and the marketing and are effectively implemented the ratio should be positively affected. The metric provides a simple number to evidence success (or lack of it).</p>

            <h2><strong>Strategies and plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Achieving a higher resource utilisation, evidenced by the ratio, could be a strategic objective in the KLS strategy and marketing plan.</p>

            <h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

            <p>The audiences are those external to the library including, other NHS health care library managers, Trust managers and other external stakeholders.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Data sources</strong></h3>

            <p>The total number of Open Athens accesses to resources can be sourced from the OpenAthens administrative statistics module.&nbsp; From the OpenAthens administrators dashboard for statistics, generate a report for required period.</p>

            <p>Select the options,<em>&nbsp;'</em>Total usage for all accounts at this level' and 'Usage total for all resources.'&nbsp; Choose a start and end date. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Typically, you can record the number for each month for a monthly presentation and for the previous twelve months for an annual percentage.</p>

            <p>The number of employees is sourced from NHS Digital's 'Workforce Statistics.'&nbsp; All things being equal the headcount will not change significantly over time.</p>

            <p>You have the option for an annual ratio of taking the last headcount for the year you are calculating the ratio for or averaging the headcount over the previous 12 months. Be sure to make clear how the number you used was derived.</p>

            <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>

            <p>Problems inherent in compiling OpenAthens accesses apply to this metric. Different profiles of use by your Trust staff will deliver the same ratio; a few super users can generate the same number of accesses as a larger number of infrequent users.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The number of resources you provide access to and how you provide access will also influence the ratio.&nbsp; While it is possible to compare with other Trusts, caution should be exercised.</p>

            <h3><strong>Frequency</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric can be repeated monthly or annually.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>This metric gives a single measure of how active Trust staff are in using eresources.&nbsp; It provides a useful indication of how successful promotion of eresources is in affecting usage by library users. It is a useful complement to the 'Percentage of NHS Open Athens Accounts to Headcount'<em>.</em>&nbsp; See also <a href="https://lihnnclinicallibs.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/a-note-on-open-athens-statistics-by-matt-holland/">A note on Open Athens Statistics</a> for a further explanation.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Improvement would be raising the ratio month on month or year on year.&nbsp; If it is available the ratio can be compared to a regional average ration. An average is available for the North West region.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Improvement in the ratio is the effect of the whole library effort (training, promotion, current awareness services etc. ) to promote us of eresources to users.&nbsp; Effective promotion of eresources should cause an increase in the ratio over time.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Percentage of NHS OpenAthens accounts to headcount.</p>

            <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric uses NHS Open Athens as a proxy for user engagement to estimate the percentage of trust staff (FTE) who are<em>&nbsp;potentially</em>&nbsp;engaged with the Library and its eResources.</p>

            <p>Calculate by (Number of Accounts / Headcount) * 100. For example, (2000 / 5000) * 100 = 40%</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important?</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Strategies and plans</strong></h3>

            <p>Achieving a higher penetration of NHS OpenAthens accounts can be a strategic objective in the knowledge and library services (KLS) strategy and marketing plan.</p>

            <h3><strong>Audience</strong></h3>

            <p>The audiences are those external to the library including, other NHS health care library managers, Trust managers and other external stakeholders.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the Metric</strong></h2>

            <h3><strong>Data Sources</strong></h3>

            <p>The number of NHS Open Athens Accounts can be sourced from the front page of the Open Athens Administrative module. Typically, you can record the number on the first of the month for a monthly presentation and an average of the previous 12 months for an annual percentage.</p>

            <p>For the annual percentage figure, you might also take the last recorded number for the period reported, e.g. 1 April each year. Be sure to make clear how the number you used was derived.</p>

            <p>The number of employees is sourced from NHS Digital's 'Workforce Statistics.'&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>

            <p>Trusts have different strategies for registering staff:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>staff may elect to have NHS OpenAthens accounts or be given them on contacting the library</li>
             <li>staff may be given an account on joining the Trust. &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Either strategy will effect the statistics and their comparability with other Trusts.&nbsp; Another limitation is the imperfect match between accounts and current staff.&nbsp; For example, unexpired accounts still on the system for staff who have left your organisation.</p>

            <p>If you can identify a specific group of staff who have OpenAthens accounts, such as doctors, and a comparable headcount you can run this metric for these discrete groups.</p>

            <h3><strong>Frequency</strong></h3>

            <p>This metric can be repeated monthly or annually.</p>

            <h3><strong>Repeatability</strong></h3>

            <p>Any NHS Trust can create this metric.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>This is a simple, easy to understand metric.&nbsp; Broadly the more NHS OpenAthens registrations, the more Trust staff have engaged with the library, at least registering for an account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For services without a physical library such as NWAS KLS, this is a useful measure of activity where other measures, for example physical visits to the library, are not available.&nbsp;&nbsp; See also&nbsp;<a href="https://lihnnclinicallibs.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/a-note-on-open-athens-statistics-by-matt-holland/">A note on Open Athens Statistics</a>.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>This metric works best against a benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, setting a benchmark to say 25% of Trust members will have registered for an NHS OpenAthens account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Achieving this benchmark or consistently exceeding it provides a measure against which to assess improvement.&nbsp; NWAS KLS sets a benchmark of 25%.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Raising the percentage of OpenAthens registrations is an objective in the NWAS KLS strategy. The means to achieve it are set out in the NWAS KLS marketing plan and the metric is reported in the monthly dashboard.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Messages about OpenAthens are included in all the libraries communications, article in newsletters, meeting with students and with those running internal courses.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The whole effort is aimed at a year on year increase in OpenAthens registrations and/or to exceed the benchmark of 25% of staff registered.</p>

            <h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>

            <p>Reported on the library monthly dashboard.</p>

            <h2><strong>Metric definition</strong></h2>

            <p>Proportion of members registered for KnowledgeShare targeted evidence updates who receive at least one email in three months.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Qualitative feedback shows that receiving regular KnowledgeShare evidence updates informs patient care and service decisions, research and education.</p>

            <p>The number of emails received varies for each recipient in relation to their own professional interests and the coverage of content in KnowledgeShare.</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare is an expenditure, which includes a small amount of staff time for categorising members’ interests – this must be shown to be a good use of resources.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <p>KnowledgeShare provides data quarterly showing all members who have signed up for targeted updates and how many emails each member has received in that time (called “FinalReportMembersCurrentAwareness”).</p>

            <p>Using the Excel filter function, filter out those members who have been added to the system fewer than three months ago.&nbsp; Excel displays how many remain.</p>

            <p>Next, filter out those members who have received zero emails. Excel displays how many remain.</p>

            <p>Calculate the proportion by dividing the second number by the first; this will be the proportion of members registered for more than three months that have received at least one email.</p>

            <p>Changes to this proportion can be plotted quarterly.</p>

            <p>NB. One can also calculate the average number of emails that members have received in this time period.&nbsp; However, this is made less useful by the fact that members can choose the frequency with which they receive emails.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>The metric indicates whether KnowledgeShare is successfully delivering targeted evidence updates to your members.</p>

            <p>For those members who do not receive emails it may be because:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>their professional interests have been set up too narrowly on the system and should be adjusted</li>
             <li>there is not sufficient content delivered through KnowledgeShare in their areas of interest (or both)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Ideally 100% of members would receive an email once per quarter but there are likely to be those whose interests are extremely niche, with little published evidence, who will receive relatively little content.</p>

            <p>Suggested bandings would be:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>green = 95%-100%</li>
             <li>amber = 85%-94%</li>
             <li>red = 0%-84%</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Check individual members who are not receiving many updates.&nbsp; Have they been categorised correctly? Can their categories be expanded (discuss with them where necessary)?</p>

            <p>Consider whether the amount of content in a particular subject area needs to be increased. What sources would improve this coverage?</p>

            <p>Discuss with suppliers of KnowledgeShare whether your team could offer to add content in this area, or whether there is capacity from another team.</p>

            <h2><strong>Why is it important? </strong></h2>

            <p>Qualitative feedback shows that receiving regular KnowledgeShare evidence updates informs patient care and service decisions, research and education.</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare is an expenditure, which must be shown to be a good use of resources.</p>

            <h2><strong>Process for compiling the metric</strong></h2>

            <p>Figures for number of active (non-expired) registered LKS members can be obtained from the library management system.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>KnowledgeShare provides data quarterly showing all members who have signed up for targeted updates (called “FinalReportMembersCurrentAwareness”).</p>

            <p>Registered KnowledgeShare members as a proportion of total LKS membership can therefore be determined.</p>

            <p>Changes to this proportion can be plotted quarterly.</p>

            <h2><strong>What does it mean?</strong></h2>

            <p>The metric indicates whether KnowledgeShare is providing an extensive targeted evidence update function for your service.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The system is designed to allow the creation of tailored updates for large numbers of members with little effort and so one should be aiming for a significant proportion of total users to be signed up.</p>

            <h2><strong>Desired outcomes</strong></h2>

            <p>Evidence updates will not be needed by some users – e.g. they may be of less use to undergraduates, estates and facilities staff, etc. Sign-up should be user-driven. However, increased promotion is likely to increase the number of recipients.</p>

            <p>An increasing proportion would be expected over the first five years of implementation, with the increase eventually slowing down and stabilising at around 30%-40%.</p>

            <p>Alternatively it would be possible to focus on particular staff groups, e.g. doctors-in-training, for whom one might expect a higher proportion.</p>

            <h2><strong>Improvement plans</strong></h2>

            <p>Increase promotion of the targeted evidence updates. Ensure that enquiry desk staff are able to promote the benefits when members join the library.</p>

            <h2><strong>Reporting</strong></h2>

            <p>One of the ways that a library may wish to demonstrate value is by providing evidence of economic impact or value for money. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>There are different ways of measuring costs and economic impact. </p>

            <p>Urquhart and Turner&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302870418_Reflections_on_the_value_and_impact_of_library_and_information_services_Part_2_impact_assessment">Reflections on the value and impact of library and information services: Part 2: impact assessment</a>&nbsp;suggest that economic impact is usually measured by cost benefit analyses or return on investment&nbsp;studies. </p>

            <p>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uhl-library.nhs.uk/cl/pdfs/scharr_evaluation_2002.pdf">basic cost analysis of a clinical librarian service</a>&nbsp;was conducted by Booth et al in 2002.</p>

            <p>Cost effective analysis is a comparative analysis of the costs and effectiveness of alternative interventions or services.  &nbsp;</p>

            <p>For example:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>competing methods of providing training&nbsp;</li>
             <li>use of different databases for information retrieval</li>

            <p>This uses a case study of mediated searching or&nbsp;information skills training in health libraries as an example.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Effectiveness tests whether something works (does what it is supposed to do) or meets its objectives.</p>

            <p>In health care, it focuses on what works and what works best. It often involves some type of measurement. It can include an evaluation, or in some cases research.</p>

            <h2><strong>Evaluation</strong><strong>&nbsp;versus research</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.hra.nhs.uk/documents/2013/09/defining-research.pdf">Evaluation</a>&nbsp;determines whether objectives have been met and meeting standards.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Research&nbsp;provides&nbsp;new knowledge.  &nbsp;</p>

            <p>In the NHS it is important to be clear about this distinction. Research projects require <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="value-and-impact-toolkit-bibliography" target="_blank">NHS ethical approval</a> whereas service evaluations do not.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Systematic reviews</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Within health care,&nbsp;systematic reviews&nbsp;summarise the effectiveness of interventions. In knowledge and library services the use&nbsp;of systematic reviews&nbsp;is increasing.</p>

            <p>Systematic review evidence, including:</p>

            <ul>

            <h2>Definition</h2>

            <p>Impact is about the influence of libraries and their services on individuals and/or on society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An easier way of thinking about impact is as the difference or change in an individual or group resulting from the contact with library services (British Standard&nbsp;3.25).</p>

            <h2><strong>Identifying</strong><strong>&nbsp;impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Bear these two key issues in mind about impact&nbsp;and knowledge and library services:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>the change (impact) can be tangible or intangible and may be difficult to quantify</li>
             <li>the impact may be difficult to separate from other influences and prove that the impact was due to the library</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Knowledge and library services may only&nbsp;contribute to an impact rather than be solely responsible for it (e.g. length of stay, patient care).&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Proxy measures</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Surrogate or proxy measures of impact may be used to monitor impact. For example, output data such as attendance, or satisfaction&nbsp;with a service. Proxy measure&nbsp;will not demonstrate actual impact.</p>

            <p>The contributions of KLSs&nbsp;can be monitored via:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>solicited methods&nbsp;such as&nbsp;questionnaires, interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
             <li>observations&nbsp;that are either&nbsp;structured or informal  &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Critical incident technique</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>The<a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/value-and-impact/value-and-impact-toolkit/tools-to-measure-impact"> critical incident technique</a> is useful for tying the impact to one particular use of the library and knowledge service.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ideally these methods should be used in combination for reliability.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>The impact of sample size and low response rates</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Care needs to be taken when making claims about impact generated from small sample sizes or low response rates.</p>

            <p>A&nbsp;minimum of 60% response rate has been recommended, by Urguhart et al. in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302870418_Reflections_on_the_value_and_impact_of_library_and_information_services_Part_2_impact_assessment">Reflections on the value and impact of library and information services: Part 2: impact assessment</a>, for samples of physicians to be confident about the claims being made.</p>

            <h2><strong>Tools to measure impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Before measuring impact, check that it is really <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="value-and-impact-toolkit-bibliography" title="What are you going to measure and for whom">impact you want to measure</a>.&nbsp;The terminology is complex and often used interchangeably.</p>

            <p>A range of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/value-and-impact/value-and-impact-toolkit/tools-to-measure-impact" title="Resources to measure impact">tools</a> is available that can be used to measure impact.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/value-and-impact/value-and-impact-toolkit/tools-to-measure-impact">logic model</a>&nbsp;visualises inputs, outputs and outcomes which demonstrate impact.</p>

            <p>It is a complex method that ideally needs the expertise of an economist. It has been used in large scale studies, most notably in the public library sector</p>

            <p>There are studies in academic library sectors. Across the board the return is similar. &nbsp;For every $1 invested in the library $4-$5 are returned. &nbsp;This suggests that similar returns may be possible in other sectors .&nbsp; See:</p>

            <p>Value is defined as:</p>

            <p>“The importance that stakeholders (funding institutions, politicians, the public, users, staff) attach to libraries and which is related to the perception of actual or potential benefit (3.75).&nbsp;The input is converted into output by means of processes. The output can have direct, predefined effects (outcomes).&nbsp;Output and outcomes can lead to impact and finally to value.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=56756" target="_blank">Methods and procedures for assessing the impact of libraries BS ISO 16439:2014. </a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>One of the ways that a library may wish to demonstrate value is by providing evidence of economic impact or value for money. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>There are different ways of measuring costs and economic impact. </p>

            <p>Urquhart and Turner&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302870418_Reflections_on_the_value_and_impact_of_library_and_information_services_Part_2_impact_assessment">Reflections on the value and impact of library and information services: Part 2: impact assessment</a>&nbsp;suggest that economic impact is usually measured by cost benefit analyses or return on investment&nbsp;studies. </p>

            <p>Effectiveness tests whether something works (does what it is supposed to do) or meets its objectives.</p>

            <p>In health care, it focuses on what works and what works best. It often involves some type of measurement. It can include an evaluation, or in some cases research.</p>

            <h2>Definition</h2>

            <p>Impact is about the influence of libraries and their services on individuals and/or on society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An easier way of thinking about impact is as the difference or change in an individual or group resulting from the contact with library services (British Standard&nbsp;3.25).</p>

            <h2><strong>Identifying</strong><strong>&nbsp;impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Bear these two key issues in mind about impact&nbsp;and knowledge and library services:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>the change (impact) can be tangible or intangible and may be difficult to quantify</li>
             <li>the impact may be difficult to separate from other influences and prove that the impact was due to the library</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Knowledge and library services may only&nbsp;contribute to an impact rather than be solely responsible for it (e.g. length of stay, patient care).&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Proxy measures</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Surrogate or proxy measures of impact may be used to monitor impact. For example, output data such as attendance, or satisfaction&nbsp;with a service. Proxy measure&nbsp;will not demonstrate actual impact.</p>

            <p>The contributions of KLSs&nbsp;can be monitored via:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>solicited methods&nbsp;such as&nbsp;questionnaires, interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
             <li>observations&nbsp;that are either&nbsp;structured or informal  &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Critical incident technique</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>The<a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/value-and-impact/value-and-impact-toolkit/tools-to-measure-impact"> critical incident technique</a> is useful for tying the impact to one particular use of the library and knowledge service.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ideally these methods should be used in combination for reliability.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>The impact of sample size and low response rates</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Care needs to be taken when making claims about impact generated from small sample sizes or low response rates.</p>

            <p>A&nbsp;minimum of 60% response rate has been recommended, by Urguhart et al. in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302870418_Reflections_on_the_value_and_impact_of_library_and_information_services_Part_2_impact_assessment">Reflections on the value and impact of library and information services: Part 2: impact assessment</a>, for samples of physicians to be confident about the claims being made.</p>

            <h2><strong>Tools to measure impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Before measuring impact, check that it is really <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="value-and-impact-toolkit-bibliography" title="What are you going to measure and for whom">impact you want to measure</a>.&nbsp;The terminology is complex and often used interchangeably.</p>

            <p>It is a complex method that ideally needs the expertise of an economist. It has been used in large scale studies, most notably in the public library sector</p>

            <p>There are studies in academic library sectors. Across the board the return is similar. &nbsp;For every $1 invested in the library $4-$5 are returned. &nbsp;This suggests that similar returns may be possible in other sectors .&nbsp; See:</p>

            <p>Value is defined as:</p>

            <p>“The importance that stakeholders (funding institutions, politicians, the public, users, staff) attach to libraries and which is related to the perception of actual or potential benefit (3.75).&nbsp;The input is converted into output by means of processes.

            <h2>Definition</h2>

            <p>Impact is about the influence of libraries and their services on individuals and/or on society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An easier way of thinking about impact is as the difference or change in an individual or group resulting from the contact with library services (British Standard&nbsp;3.25).</p>

            <h2><strong>Identifying</strong><strong>&nbsp;impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Bear these two key issues in mind about impact&nbsp;and knowledge and library services:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>the change (impact) can be tangible or intangible and may be difficult to quantify</li>
             <li>the impact may be difficult to separate from other influences and prove that the impact was due to the library</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Knowledge and library services may only&nbsp;contribute to an impact rather than be solely responsible for it (e.g. length of stay, patient care).&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>Proxy measures</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Surrogate or proxy measures of impact may be used to monitor impact. For example, output data such as attendance, or satisfaction&nbsp;with a service. Proxy measure&nbsp;will not demonstrate actual impact.</p>

            <p>The contributions of KLSs&nbsp;can be monitored via:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>solicited methods&nbsp;such as&nbsp;questionnaires, interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
             <li>observations&nbsp;that are either&nbsp;structured or informal  &nbsp;</li>
            </ul>

            <h2><strong>Critical incident technique</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>The<a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/quality-and-impact/value-and-impact/value-and-impact-toolkit/tools-to-measure-impact"> critical incident technique</a> is useful for tying the impact to one particular use of the library and knowledge service.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ideally these methods should be used in combination for reliability.&nbsp;</p>

            <h2><strong>The impact of sample size and low response rates</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Care needs to be taken when making claims about impact generated from small sample sizes or low response rates.</p>

            <p>A&nbsp;minimum of 60% response rate has been recommended, by Urguhart et al. in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302870418_Reflections_on_the_value_and_impact_of_library_and_information_services_Part_2_impact_assessment">Reflections on the value and impact of library and information services: Part 2: impact assessment</a>, for samples of physicians to be confident about the claims being made.</p>

            <h2><strong>Tools to measure impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

            <p>Before measuring impact, check that it is really <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="value-and-impact-toolkit-bibliography" title="What are you going to measure and for whom">impact you want to measure</a>.&nbsp;The terminology is complex and often used interchangeably.</p>

            <p>Most Significant Change (MSC) methodology is a technique with a high level of involvement from stakeholders&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Stakeholders participate in the decisions about what changes are recorded and reported. &nbsp;They are also involved in analysing the resulting information. The method involves the generation and collection of a range of significant change impact stories, with the most significant of these being selected for use.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235293909_Libraries_and_return_on_investment_ROI_A_meta-analysis">Libraries and return on investment (ROI): A meta-analysis</a>, Svanhold Aabø defines return on investment as An economic evaluation that seeks to justify investment made (in an information service) in terms of the gains or losses (to the organisation) that might be attributed to the investment.</p>

            <p>It is a complex method that ideally needs the expertise of an economist. It has been used in large scale studies, most notably in the public library sector</p>

            <p>There are studies in academic library sectors. Across the board the return is similar. &nbsp;For every $1 invested in the library $4-$5 are returned. &nbsp;This suggests that similar returns may be possible in other sectors .&nbsp; See:</p>

            <p>The last study provides an example and some tools of its use in a hospital library in the US. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>One of the largest UK studies relates to the British Library (<a href="https://cercles.diba.cat/documentsdigitals/pdf/E130253.pdf">Economic valuation of the British Library</a>&nbsp;by Andrew Tessler).

            <p>“The importance that stakeholders (funding institutions, politicians, the public, users, staff) attach to libraries and which is related to the perception of actual or potential benefit (3.75).&nbsp;The input is converted into output by means of processes.

             <li>if the specific cost saving has not been calculated ask the interviewee to provide an informed estimate of cost savings</li>

            <p>We have been quite rigorous in looking at the existing evidence and existing tools, and have striven to ensure that the data collected maps to the current evident base regarding health library impact.</p>

            <p>In the past slightly different wording or outcome categories has made comparison between studies difficult. This has been compounded by small samples suggesting that the evidence base is weak.</p>

            <p>Using the questions as they stand will make comparison, and collation of data possible and allow us to develop the evidence base at a national level. Libraries can add more specific questions (or develop their own), but ideally these should be selected from existing tools (such as the others listed in the toolkit) to enable comparison to other studies and to help us build the evidence base at local and national levels.</p>

            <p>If we are unable to accept the case study for any reason you will receive a message detailing the reasons for this. Successful case studies are uploaded to the public facing area of the blog and Knowedge for Healthcare leads notified of examples added from their regions.</p>

          hippostd:content: |-
            <p>The forms is set up on the assumption that personally attributable data is included so if this is not the case with your case study then obviously you don't need to get consent from these third parties.</p>

            <p>Just check that if you are quoting anyone and not actually giving their name, their identity cannot be traced back in other ways (eg through job titles: "Head of Nursing").</p>

            <p>If all the information contained in the case study is from you/library staff then you could read this is you /library staff giving consent for us to use it.</p>

        /hee:expanderDetails:
          jcr:primaryType: hippostd:html
          hippostd:content: |-
            <p>We sought advice on this and confirm that GDPR should not stop services collecting Impact information relating to their service.</p>

            <p>Collection of impact data is an inherent part of the library service itself. If you receive the services of the library then you are asked about its impact.</p>

            <p>The Quality Improvement Framework makes it clear that gathering Impact data is an essential element of an NHS Library and Knowledge service. Hence provision of the service and collection of impact data pertaining to it are two parts of a single continuum of service.</p>

            <p>If you feel that impact data collection is a distinct activity in its own right, and cannot be justified as above, then legitimate interest would be a reasonable basis for processing the data.</p>

            <p>However:&nbsp;</p>

            <ul>
             <li>if recipients actively object to any impact information requests then they should not be approached in the future</li>
             <li>to avoid confusion any requests for impact data should not be sent alongside promotional or marketing information</li>

            <p>Stakeholder 2 (Trainer) wants confident users who regularly use resources to find what they want and need.</p>

            <p>Stakeholder 3 (Library Manager) wants to know the costs of training compared to other methods and the value of the training to the organisation.</p>

            <h3>What are our possible measures or metrics?&nbsp;</h3>

            <p>For the desired outcomes of Stakeholder 1 (User) possible measures could be the use of the learned skills and their perceived confidence.</p>

            <p>For the desired outcomes of Stakeholder 2 (Trainer) possible measures could be the use of learned skills, their perceived confidence, and their ability to find evidence.</p>

            <p>For the desired outcomes of Stakeholder 3 (Library Manager) we might want to measure whether the skills learned in training are used, how these learned skills are used, the cost of training versus mediated search, and the feasibility of providing group rather than 1 to 1 training.</p>

            <p>It is run annually and provides information on the satisfaction of final year undergraduates with all aspects of their University courses.</p>

            <p>Answers are ranked on a&nbsp;5 point&nbsp;scale from “definitely agree to definitely disagree." &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Libraries at higher education institutions use the responses from the questionnaire to help with planning.</p>

            <p>Libqual is a validated standardised survey widely used in academic libraries to measure satisfaction.</p>

            <p>It also asks what users expect from the library service.</p>

            <p>In the UK, it is run by  the Society of College, National and University Libraries (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.sconul.ac.uk/page/what-is-libqual">SCONUL</a>) so that participating libraries can benchmark their performance against other university libraries.</p>

            <p>The survey comprises 22 items and 5 additional items can be added relevant to the local library.</p>

            <p>There is a considerable amount of guidance available to help administer the survey and analyse the results.</p>

            <p>Evidence suggests that reading for pleasure lifts people’s moods. Previously, the Library team had delivered mood-boosting sessions in the Library and to the Trust’s literacy cohort, gaining positive feedback.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In response to requests, the second phase has been for the Library Manager, Senior Library Assistant and Trust’s Co-ordinating Chaplain to take mood-boosting reading sessions on two wards.</p>

            <p>Themed readings are selected from national Reading Agency collections which were added to Library stock. Brief passages of prose and poems are read for 15-20 minutes to patients and staff in the day room of Torbay’s Care of the Elderly ward, and to patients in the day room of the residential mental health ward.</p>

            <p>Other health information providers have collections of resources that may be useful to your organisation, patients or the public.&nbsp; These range from sets of fiction books for book clubs to collections of patient information materials that you can make available in the health library.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Some public libraries will also donate withdrawn books for ward book trolleys.&nbsp; Local public libraries’ e-books collection can include self-help titles that you can help publicise (as well as providing demonstrations of how to access them).&nbsp; Voluntary organisations have a wealth of information materials available. Public libraries’ local history collections can be a rich source of material for reminiscence resources.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Developing reminiscence resources can be an area where public libraries, health libraries and memory service clinicians can collaborate.</p>

            <h4>Examples and resources</h4>

            <p>Reminiscence boxes held in Wirral public libraries and Wirral University Teaching Hospital;<em>&nbsp;</em>Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust reminiscence boxes and other Activities to Share resources – available to patients and carers as well as staff and volunteers at the hospital.</p>

            <p>The collection was initiated as part of a joint project with Hardwick CCG and Chesterfield Royal Hospital library. Later boxes were produced jointly with public library staff from Nottinghamshire County Council libraries.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.surreyandsussexlibraryservices.nhs.uk/autumn-reads/">Surrey and Sussex Libraries&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;made an Autumn Reads collection of fiction from their local public library available in two of their hospital libraries: aims to encourage reading for pleasure, improve literacy and make it easier for busy staff to use the public library.</p>

            <p>Sherwood Forest Hospitals - the library worked with the Community Paediatrics department to assemble a Child Health Collection, for use by patients and carers of their autism, ADHD and Down’s syndrome clinics. A librarian attends the clinic when possible and takes/answers information requests and the external Community Paediatrics website promotes the Library and its collection to users.</p>

          hippostd:content: |-
            <p>Staff in the voluntary sector and public libraries frequently handle enquiries on health topics from members of the public.&nbsp; Health library staff have specialist skills in this area that are worth sharing, for example through providing training for public library staff or setting up a referral pathway for more complex health queries.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Conversely, health library staff are often not aware of the range of health information and resources available from other sources – inviting a public librarian or other health information provider in to talk to the library team can raise awareness and improve signposting to each other’s resources and expertise.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your public library also often maintains the local Community Directory – it is worth checking to make sure that your Trust is aware of it and using it to good effect.</p>

            <h4>Examples and resources</h4>

            <p>Shropshire information providers and staff from the mental health trust collaborated on setting up training on how to make libraries a comfortable environment for people with mental health issues – this idea is transferable to other themes.</p>

            <p>North East London NHS Trust’s Library team provided hands on health information skills training to local public library staff as part of the Trust’s Recovery College pilot project.</p>

            <p>South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust offers&nbsp;regular information literacy training and coaching sessions for staff in the local recovery colleges.</p>

            <p>Several examples of cross sector collaboration – Nottinghamshire Health Information Forum (HIF) – members of hospital libraries, public libraries and voluntary sector bodies in Nottingham City and the county meet regularly to share knowledge and information.</p>

            <p>Similar examples at Brighton and&nbsp;Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust - involved in a Brighton and&nbsp;Hove wide health information group.</p>

            <p>Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust – working in partnership with the staff of Barnsley Public Libraries and St Nicholas Hospital.</p>

            <p>Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust – part of the Well-being Information Partnership (WIP) with public libraries.</p>

            <p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wkp.nhs.uk/knowledge-services/books-on-prescription/">Worcestershire Books on Prescriptions Steering Group</a>&nbsp;is a cross-sector group of GPs, volunteers, public and health groups working to launch and promote quality self-help books. This group is currently working to re-engage with the prison service to re-launch BOPs for prisons.</p>

            <p>A key element of the Knowledge for Healthcare vision statement involves ensuring patients and the public use the right information at the right time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There are any number of events and themed weeks on healthcare topics; and these can provide an excellent opportunity to work with other local health providers and clinicians to get across health messages and raise awareness of the many sources of health information now available.</p>

            <p>Possible activities range from putting up a display or staffing an information stall, to simply ensuring that relevant leaflets or awareness raising material from other local information providers are on display at your library or Trust events.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your library could also join in initiatives to support literacy or encourage reading for pleasure, such as the national Six Book Challenge which is aimed at encouraging less confident readers.</p>

            <h4><strong>Examples and resources</strong></h4>

            <p><a href="https://readingagency.org.uk/">Reading Agency website</a>&nbsp;for information about their events (including the Six Book Challenge) and initiatives to encourage reading.</p>

            <p>The Health Information Week web page gives a list of examples of events from previous years – many of these events have been organised by a health library or involve collaboration between the NHS and other local organisations.</p>

            <p>NHS Employers publish a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhsemployers.org/your-workforce/retain-and-improve/staff-experience/health-work-and-wellbeing/sustaining-the-momentum/calendar-of-national-campaigns-2016">calendar of national campaigns</a>&nbsp;including awareness days, weeks and months.

            <p>Public libraries hold Reading for Well-being titles that you can publicise around your Trust and draw to the attention of local clinicians so that they can signpost these to their service users and carers.&nbsp; It’s also worth thinking about possible connections between Arts for Health and public libraries, for example some public libraries have exhibition space and some may run activities of interest to mental health inpatients once they’ve been discharged.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Developing reminiscence resources can be an area where public libraries, health libraries and memory service clinicians can collaborate.</p>

            <p>Staff in the voluntary sector and public libraries frequently handle enquiries on health topics from members of the public.&nbsp; Health library staff have specialist skills in this area that are worth sharing, for example through providing training for public library staff or setting up a referral pathway for more complex health queries.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Conversely, health library staff are often not aware of the range of health information and resources available from other sources – inviting a public librarian or other health information provider in to talk to the library team can raise awareness and improve signposting to each other’s resources and expertise.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your public library also often maintains the local Community Directory – it is worth checking to make sure that your Trust is aware of it and using it to good effect.</p>

            <h4>Examples and resources</h4>

            <p>Shropshire information providers and staff from the mental health trust collaborated on setting up training on how to make libraries a comfortable environment for people with mental health issues – this idea is transferable to other themes.</p>

             <li>Two days prior to the knowledge exchange, the knowledge holder receives a copy of the knowledge exchange questions (see questions in the Elicitation interview, in the <a href="knowledge-retention-and-transfer-toolkit">Knowledge Retention and Transfer Toolkit</a>).</li>

             <li>Relationship mapping (see below) provides an overview of the relationships the knowledge holder has with key contacts in the organisation.</li>
             <li>The facilitator must then decide the best way to package this knowledge for the organisation. This may include: drawing up instructional guidelines, mapping business processes, producing a list of useful contact information and relationships,&nbsp;and&nbsp;recording as audio or film some of the knowledge holder’s information.</li>
             <li>The facilitator may then choose to upload this information onto the team intranet, team shared drive, or save as a standalone file for future reference.</li>

            <p>Once you are clear on your purpose, select participants who have the diversity of knowledge, skills and experiences needed for the peer assist. Six to eight people is a good number.</p>

            <p>Look “across” the organisation rather than “up” it – hierarchies can hamper the free exchange of knowledge whereas peers tend to be much more open with each other and can challenge without feeling threatened.</p>

            <p>Avoid the temptation to select “the usual suspects”: if the same experts are selected for peer assists again and again, you may be limiting the number of fresh ideas and perspectives available to you.</p>

            <p>Similarly, seek to select people who will challenge your ways of thinking and working and perhaps offer a different angle, rather than looking for people who will validate your current approach. You might consider inviting people from outside your organisation.</p>

            <p>Be&nbsp;clear about&nbsp;what you hope to achieve during the peer assist and then plan the time to achieve that.</p>

            <p>The deliverables should comprise options and insights rather than providing an answer. It is up to the person or team who called the peer assist to then make the relevant decisions, based on what is learned.</p>

            <p>Provide the participants with any briefing materials in advance so that they have adequate time to prepare.</p>

            <p>Allow time for socialising – Allow time in your agenda for the teams to get to know one another; this might be a dinner the night before or time for coffee at the start of the day. It is important to build rapport so that the group can work openly together.</p>

            <p>At the start of the meeting, ensure that everyone is clear about the purpose of the peer assist and their roles within it.</p>

            <p>The role of the host team is to listen in order to understand and learn. The role of the visiting team is to share knowledge and experience to help resolve the challenge without adding to the workload.</p>

            <p>Agree that where there are areas of contention, you will focus on the activity rather than the individual people involved.</p>

            <p>Divide the meeting time roughly into four equal parts. During the first quarter, the host team will present the context, history and their future plans regarding the problem or challenge in question. Keep this part short and sharp – you only want to say enough to get the visiting team started in the right direction. Remember that the purpose of the peer assist is to learn rather than tell.</p>

            <p>When communicating the problem or challenge about which you are seeking input, be prepared for it to be redefined as part of the peer assist process. It may be that the problem you have identified is in fact the symptom of a further problem and the peer assist will help you identify the root cause.</p>

            <p>In the second quarter, the visitors consider what they have heard, and then begin by discussing what they have heard that has surprised them, and what they expected to hear but haven’t.</p>

            <p>The host team should take a back seat at this stage and simply listen; in some cases they may even opt to leave the room. The visitors then consider what else they need to know to address the problem and where might they find that knowledge.</p>

            <p>It may be that they want to make some telephone calls and talk to some other people, or request some data or reports. Remember, they are not seeking to solve the problem but to offer some options and insights based on their own knowledge and experience.</p>

            <p>The third quarter of the meeting is for the visiting team to then analyse and reflect on what they have learned and to examine options.</p>

            <p>Again, the home team remains largely in the back seat; it might be appropriate to involve one or two of them, provided that they continue to listen and learn rather than closing off options or seeking to draw conclusions too early.</p>

            <p>In the fourth and final quarter of the meeting, the visiting team presents their feedback to the host team and answers any questions.</p>

            <p>The presentation will be along the lines of “what we have learned, what options we see, and what has worked elsewhere”. As with all feedback, this should start with the positive – what has been done well, and then what options there are to do things differently.</p>

            <p>When presenting what has worked elsewhere, presenters should simply tell the story rather than prescribing “you should…”</p>

            <p>The person who called the peer assist should acknowledge the contribution of the visiting team, and also commit to when he or she will get back with an action list of what the team are going to do differently.</p>

            <p>Finally, invite the visiting team to reflect on what they have learned and what they will take away and apply. Learning is never one-way.</p>

            <p>In the context of the NHS, an important consideration is that of evidence-based practice. When conducting peer assists, you will need to ensure that lessons learned are based on a combination of both on-the-job experience and sound research evidence.</p>

            <p>You might wish to carry out an After Action Review following your peer assist to look at whether the process went according to plan, what was different and why, and what can you learn from that for the next time.</p>

            <p>While the peer assist process is designed to provide input for a specific purpose or project, consider who else might benefit from the lessons learned. Always look out for opportunities to share and re-use knowledge and learning.</p>

            <p>When communicating the problem or challenge about which you are seeking input, be prepared for it to be redefined as part of the peer assist process.

            <p>The host team should take a back seat at this stage and simply listen; in some cases they may even opt to leave the room. The visitors then consider what else they need to know to address the problem and where might they find that knowledge.</p>

            <p>It may be that they want to make some telephone calls and talk to some other people, or request some data or reports. Remember, they are not seeking to solve the problem but to offer some options and insights based on their own knowledge and experience.</p>
