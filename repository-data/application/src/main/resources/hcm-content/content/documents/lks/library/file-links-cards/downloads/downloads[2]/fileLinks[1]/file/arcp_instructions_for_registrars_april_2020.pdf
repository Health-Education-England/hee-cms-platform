Summary  
This document provides guidance on the collation of documents required for the ARCP process 

https://www.copmed.org.uk/gold-guide-7th-edition/the-gold-guide-7th-edition.  

ARCP is held in Spring and Autumn each year.  

It is the registrar’s responsibility to ensure their evidence, activity summary sheets and all other 

documentation (including Educational Supervisor report, Form R etc) are uploaded on the ePortfolio 

2 weeks before the ARCP date. Documents uploaded to ePortfolio must use the naming convention 

explained below.  

A registrar-written guide to using the ePortfolio for ARCP has been produced

Preparing evidence for the ARCP panel 
You must complete and submit your ARCP paperwork – including your educational supervisor’s 

report – at least 2 weeks prior to the ARCP panel date to allow time for portfolio assessors and panel 

members to review the documentation.  

You should be collecting evidence on an ongoing basis and uploading to the e-portfolio where 

possible.   

Only evidence submitted by the time of the educational review meeting with your educational 

supervisor will be considered for the educational supervisor’s report and only this evidence will be 

considered by the ARCP panel.  

Evidence submitted after this review meeting will not be considered by the upcoming ARCP panel, 

but can be considered for the following ARCP.  

In rare instances, where there are concerns about a registrar’s progress it may be necessary for your 

Training Programme Director to provide an additional report, for example, detailing events that led 

to a negative assessment by your educational supervisor. This will be shared with you prior to its 

submission to the panel. This is to ensure that you are aware of what is being reported, and you may 

not necessarily agree with the report’s contents. You may submit a response to any element of the 

assessment documentation for the panel to take into account in their deliberations.  

Attendance  
The ARCP is a review of the documented and submitted evidence that you prepare and you will not 

be expected to attend the ARCP panel unless an unsatisfactory outcome is anticipated. In these 

circumstances, you will be contacted and expected to attend the ARCP panel in order to receive 

notification of the outcome and any associated feedback.  

Process  
Portfolios will be scrutinised by one or more portfolio assessors and a final decision on the ARCP 

outcome is made by the whole panel (including an external assessor and lay representative). Your 

educational supervisor(s) should not be present in an ARCP panel when your progress is being 

considered.  

The template and guidance used by assessors is available on the HEEoE website. You are advised to 

read this so that you are properly informed of the elements of your work which will be scrutinised. 

Registrars receiving an outcome 1 or 6 will receive an outcome form advising them of this with brief 

comments and feedback from the panel. The outcome form will be sent normally within a week of 

the ARCP. At some point after the panel, you should meet with your educational supervisor to plan 

and document the next stage of training.  You must sign a copy of the outcome form and return it to 

HEEoE within 10 days of receipt and should upload a copy as evidence towards your next ARCP.

ARCP documentation & ePortfolio  
You should compile your portfolio contemporaneously. You are strongly advised not to leave 

preparing your portfolio until shortly before ARCP.  

The documents required for inclusion/uploading are detailed below.   Please use the standard file 

names as set out below as this will assist portfolio assessors in finding your documents and evidence.  

Templates for ARCP documents are available from http://www.fph.org.uk or the HEE website 

https://heeoe.hee.nhs.uk/public_health/specialty-training-programme/arcp-public-health.  

The educational supervisor’s report is a key piece of evidence in making an assessment of your 

progress. It is your responsibility to ensure that your supervisor collates workplace based feedback 

from any other members of staff who provide you with supervision to include as part of a 

comprehensive report. It is also necessary to ensure that your ES report includes sufficient 

information to be suitable for revalidation. Guidance for educational supervisors can be found on 

the HEEoE website.  All workplace-based assessments included in your portfolio should contain 

feedback from a supervisor. It is your responsibility to ensure that this feedback is collected. You are 

advised to allow sufficient time for supervisors to complete feedback which is a required for a 

comprehensive assessment of your progress by the panel. 

• Please ensure you have included a report from all educational supervisors you have had 

since your last ARCP  

• Please ensure that you assign all uploaded evidence to a specific ARCP. If you do not there is 

a possibility that your assessor will not find the document and be unable to take that 

evidence into account  

Using the ePortfolio  
Registrars are expected to use the ePortfolio as designed with the exception of those registrars who 

have transitioned to the 2015 curriculum (rather than using it from the start of training).   See below: 

Note that there are a few versions of various forms circulating and if the differences are minor there 

is no need to transcribe, but please plan to use the latest version.

Academic registrars, and registrars attending the MPhil 
The ARCP preparation that is required from all public health academic trainees (ACF/Ls) in the East 

of England in addition to the standard procedures described below: 

 

1. Arrange an annual assessment of academic progress to take place at least one month before 

the joint academic/clinical ARCP panel convenes. Those present (in person or by 

phone/skype) at this assessment should include the trainee and educational supervisor, 

clinical supervisor from the service attachment, and academic supervisor from the academic 

attachment. If appropriate, the director of the academic programme (Academic Training 

Lead) may also attend. 

2. Ensure that the ‘Report on Academic Trainees’ Progress’ form 

(https://www.fph.org.uk/training-careers/specialty-training/training-eportfolio/ ) is 

completed at the meeting and signed by the trainee and academic supervisor for submission 

to the annual joint academic/clinical ARCP panel. This should include a recommendation of 

whether the registrar should continue on the academic path.

For registrars where there are concerns  
If for any reason a registrar is not progressing as expected, this will be set out in the ESR.  

Occasionally in these circumstances it may be necessary for your Training Programme Director to 

provide an additional report.  Any report will be shared with the registrar prior to its submission to 

the panel. This is to ensure that they are aware of what is being reported, and it is recognised that 

they may not necessarily agree with the report’s contents. The registrar may submit a response to 

any element of the assessment documentation for the panel to take into account in their 

deliberations.  

A registrar will be asked to attend the ARCP panel if an unsatisfactory outcome is anticipated. In 

these circumstances the registrar expected to attend the ARCP panel in order to receive notification 

of the outcome, any associated feedback, and discuss the most appropriate next steps.  

Notes for supervisors  
Educational supervisor role for ARCP 

For each registrar 

• Based on supervisory meetings during the year you will have a view of a registrar’s overall 
progress, any challenges and career pathway. This should be reflected in your Educational 
Supervisor’s report (ESR) 

• Use the standard clinical supervisor report template to gather evidence and include it, 
verbatim where useful, in your ESR.

mailto:aks76@medschl.cam.ac.uk

• Improvements in your ESR may be requested to ensure the quality of reports is consistently 
high enough to enable panel judgments to be made. 

• You may wish to provide feedback to the clinical supervisors from whom you sought 
information on the usefulness of their reports. 

• A registrar on an academic track should organise a three-way meeting with you, them and 
their academic supervisor.  Please confirm that an academic supervisor’s report has been 
submitted to ARCP and comment on their academic progression in your report 

• A registrar who is Out of Programme for whatever reason still needs to submit a Form R.   

• Registrars OOPR should also submit an ASR.  Registrars OOPE should submit a short piece 
describe their recent activities 

• The ARCP acts as an annual appraisal for both the employing body and for future medical 
revalidation. You must comment on their fitness to practice and on the specific KA9 areas 
which require annual assessment (KA9.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.6, 9.7, 9.11) 

• As you sign off LOs and have your pre-ARCP meeting with your registrar, you should check 
the following documents are of adequate quality and available to the ARCP panel, 
commenting in your ESR where there are any issues the panel should be aware of. 

o On call log 
o Form R 
o Study leave record 
o Previous ARCP outcomes and any relevant letters 

• Ensure that the learning agreement covers the period of an ARCP and at least the six months 
following ARCP. If a placement move is anticipated, the projects planned and the anticipated 
learning outcomes to be gained should be provided in as much detail as possible. This should 
already have been written to support a placement panel discussion. 

• The learning agreement should explicitly link the pieces of work planned to the learning 
outcomes anticipated to enable the panel to take a view on whether the plan is likely to 
deliver adequate progress.  Registrars within a year of CCT should provide a detailed plan of 
how they intend to secure all outstanding LOs.  The learning agreement is not adequate if it 
has not been signed by the TPD. 

•  For any registrar returning from OOP, ARCP may be deferred if less than 3 months of 
training has been secured since last ARCP 

• You will receive the outcomes for your registrars from Health Education England 
o You will also receive feedback useful for your own CPD.  General comments will be 

fed back to all supervisors via TPDs and supervisor development sessions and you 
will receive an individual feedback form for at least one ARCP every three years 
which you may find useful for revalidation.  

 

You will be expected to attend at least one ARCP in a three year period 

 

As second assessor 

 for the ARCP process you are acting as a virtual member of the ARCP panel. It is therefore 

critical that your assessment of the portfolio of those trainees you are allocated is thorough. 

Please complete the assessment form in detail including your comments on the quality of the 

paperwork as well as its presence or absence.  It is critical that at this point TPDs are made 

aware of any concerns where you believe a registrar may receive: 

o An outcome 5 due to insufficient paperwork available 



7 
 

o An adverse outcome due to failure to progress 
 

 

Academic supervisor role for ARCP 

• Based on supervisory meetings during the year you will have a view of a registrar’s overall 
progress and any challenges which should be reflected in your report. 

• For MPhil registrars on a general training pathway i.e. not ACFs a brief report to the ARCP 
panel confirming their MPhil progress will be enough unless you have any concerns 

• If you are supervising a registrar on an academic track (ACF/L) you must have a three-way 
meeting with the registrar and their educational supervisor before the ARCP and include the 
outcome of any decisions made as well as your view of their progression in your report. 

• The academic supervisor’s report for registrars on an academic track is critical to enabling 
the panel to make a sound judgment of their progression and should be completed in detail. 
Your comments should be specific and backed up with examples and evidence for both their 
areas of good practice and development. Recommendation should be SMART.
