          <p>The slides and script from mobilising evidence and knowledge bite size video one on mobilising evidence and knowledge.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title slide</p>

          <p>Welcome to the first in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What is mobilising evidence and knowledge</p>

          <p>Mobilising evidence and knowledge describes a process where people use research, data, insight and the skills, experience or ideas from other people to help them with their work. It can underpin informed decision making by tapping into what has been published and other peoples know how.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Why is this important for healthcare?</p>

          <p>We know that healthcare is a knowledge based industry undergoing constant change with ever increasing demand and complexity of care. There is a call to become more streamlined and efficient to avoid unnecessary duplication. To continually learn so that future work builds upon best practice and avoids pitfalls. To drive innovation. This is why mobilising evidence and knowledge is important as it is by sharing and re-using what we know already that we can continue to make improvements.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>How can this be achieved?</p>

          <p>This can be achieved by encouraging more people in the health service to use evidence from research but also to connect with each other to share ideas, to collect this know-how and make it available for re-use by individual teams and organisations. There are some simple techniques available that can help with this such as those described in the NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Quick reference cards</p>

          <p>There are 13 techniques that are part of the Knowledge Mobilisation Framework. Each one is described on a postcard or quick reference “aide memoire” card. Each postcard shows you how to undertake each technique, the expected duration of the activity. The colour coding on the postcards shows you whether they should be used before, during or after a particular activity.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>E-learning</p>

          <p>To complement the postcards, we have developed a suite of 11 E-Learning modules featuring some of the techniques.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>These resources are free to access via the e-learning for healthcare platform as well as via ESR. The e-learning programme incorporates a choosing tool to help people decide which tool may be best for them at a particular moment.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Each module briefly introduces each technique – highlighting the benefits, provides a quick overview of how to do the techniques and invites participants to have a go at using the technique either by completing a short activity or by planning use of the technique in a real life situation.</p>

          <p>Four of the modules - Self Assessment Tool, Peer Assist, Action Learning Set and Retrospect also incorporate some video clips to show the techniques in use and the benefits of using them</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The role of librarians and knowledge specialists</p>

          <p>Your role as a knowledge specialist is to spot opportunities to encourage the use of evidence and knowledge by individuals, teams and your organisation. Make sure you are aware of key priorities within your organisation and be able to provide evidence to support decision-making. A simple next step would be to become familiar with some of the techniques in the NHS Knowledge Mobilisation Framework to see how you can apply them in your local context – this may involve you or your team facilitating a knowledge mobilisation technique or it could be as simple as making NHS colleagues aware of the benefits from using knowledge mobilisation techniques.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What next?</p>

          <p>The next bite sized sessions will explore some of the knowledge mobilisation techniques in more detail, make suggestions for how to get started and provide examples of how they have been used by other knowledge specialists. For further examples visit the KM Toolkit and take a look at the KM stories by using the link at the foot of this slide.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The slides and script from the second bite-size video on Learning Before.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title page</p>

          <p>Welcome to the second video in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge where we will look in more detail at some Learning Before techniques.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Effectively sharing knowledge</p>

          <p>Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the know-how of staff, using research evidence and implementing best practice are all business critical. The Knowledge Mobilisation Framework emphasizes learning throughout the an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after. It provides a set of tools and techniques that are simple and quick to use that people can integrate into their daily practice, to encourage continual learning, replication of good practice and avoidance of pitfalls. The tools and techniques facilitate learning and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.</p>

          <p>It is a cyclical process – learning before can lead to learning during and learning after which then feeds back into learning before.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Learning before</p>

          <p>By improving learning before you consider who has done similar work before? Who has worked with this client before? Where have we similar skills?</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Self assessment tool</p>

          <p>The self-assessment tool is a simple framework has been developed to quickly assess how a team or health organisation can make better use of knowledge as an asset. Often referred to as “The Board Tool” this framework enables a dialogue between a representative of a library and knowledge service and senior executives in a health organisation to see how they are currently using external evidence and organisational knowledge and to devise an action plan to help the organisation develop best practice with targeted support.</p>

          <p>The technique takes approximately 1 hour to use and helps to open up dialogue about the range of services the local library and knowledge team can offer to help the organisation meet their objectives.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Self-assessment tool in action</p>

          <p>Rachel Cooke has used the self-assessment tool in her Trust, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. It has transformed the way her team works with the Medical Division. Rachel says:</p>

          <p>“I used the evidence and knowledge self-assessment tool with the Medical Division at Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust. They found the tool easy to use and were enthusiastic about the opportunities it presented. As a result of using the tool a member of my team now regularly attends the Divisional Board Meeting to respond to knowledge and evidence needs that arise during the meeting and act as guardians for ensuring divisional policies are fully evidence based, updated and easy to access.”</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Peer assist</p>

          <p>A Peer Assist is a structured facilitated meeting or workshop where people are invited from other business units or other businesses to provide their experience, insights and knowledge to a team who have requested help.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the peer assist session it is important to appoint a facilitator as well as circulating background information including purpose and objectives of the meeting.</p>

          <p>There are four stages to the peer assist.</p>

          <ol>
           <li>The home team present context, history and plans for the future and what they hope to get out of the meeting.</li>
           <li>Visitors ask question and provide feedback about what worked well for them and what could have been done better.</li>
           <li>The Home team analyses and reflects on what’s been learned and examines options.</li>
           <li>Finally, the visitors present feedback answer questions and agree actions with the home team.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The duration of the process is usually half a day. The teams benefit by gaining insight into how someone else has approached something and confirming an approach that was taken.</p>

          <h3>Important: Information</h3>

          <p>The YouTube link provided is to Professor Martin Elliott's lecture on his experience with the Formula One team as the interview is no longer available&nbsp;</p>

          <p>To see real benefits from a peer assist, view the interview with Professor Martin Elliott a surgeon at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Martin undertakes arterial switch procedures which is an open heart surgery that restores a normal blood circulation in a baby's body. He was concerned that it may be factors associated with the teams involved rather the health of the patient that may adversely impact on the wellbeing of the baby. This procedure normally takes a surgical team 6-7 hours; the baby is then transferred to Intensive Care where it is the responsibility of a new team to manage the baby’s care.</p>

          <p>The idea to get in touch with the Ferrari Formula One Team came following a late night and early morning of surgery when a grand prix was on the television in the break room. The pit stops took as little as 6.8 seconds and everyone involved had specific jobs to do and it looked a very slick operation. A colleague of Martin’s got in touch with Bernie Ecclestone who put the team in touch with Ferrari. It soon transpired there was a mutual professional interest in doing something well.</p>

          <p>The Surgical team travelled to Marinello to meet the Ferrari F1 team.</p>

          <p>The F1 pit stop team have a clear definition of roles and leadership. They rehearse many times verbally and rehearse and try to anticipate what might go wrong. In the NHS there is often little time for rehearsal.</p>

          <p>On returning to the UK the surgical team brought in a human factors expert who conducted and observational study which resulted in a number of interventions including structured handovers, defined tasks and rehearsals. The result has been a reduction in time transferring a patient from the operating theatre to intensive care and a reduction of the number of errors by 50%.</p>

          <p>If you want to know more about this you can you view and interview with Martin via the YouTube link.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Before action review</p>

          <p>The Before Action Review helps a team state their intention (task, purpose and end-state) just before commencing the project, project stage or a piece of work, but also adds the discipline of predicting challenges and risks and, most important, drawing on lessons learned from past experiences at the start.</p>

          <p>Four questions make up this technique;</p>

          <ol>
           <li>What are we setting out to achieve?</li>
           <li>What can be learned from similar situations and past projects from elsewhere?</li>
           <li>What will deliver success?</li>
           <li>What are the actions we need to take to avoid problems and apply good practice?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>It can be run in as little as 15 minutes.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Appreciative Inquiry</p>

          <p>Within appreciative inquiry the focus is on seeing the world differently. Participants are invited to celebrate what is working well, analyse why and then to imagine the best possible future outcome and how to achieve it. The process often involves creative expression of the future outcome.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use learning before techniques</p>

          <p>Think about a recent enquiry you have received or about a key priority for your organisation – could you recommend a learning before tool to help the use of evidence and knowledge?</p>

          <p>To get you started think about the following scenarios – how would you introduce a learning before tool</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Putting it to the test</p>

          <p>Which learning before tool might you use in the following situations?</p>

          <p>In scenario one we imagine that we are supplying an article about new virtual fracture clinics, you notice from the abstract that these have been introduced successfully in a London Trust. What could you share with your requestor to encourage them to learn more?</p>

          <p>A Peer Assist will enable one team to learn from another team who have put something similar into place. In this instance you may want to suggest to the person requesting the article that they may like to set up a peer assist with the team from the London Trust to learn more about how they set up the fracture clinic. You could offer to facilitate the session for them.</p>

          <p>In scenario 2 you discover that the Trust are planning to refresh the Trust values. What technique could you share with the person leading this work?</p>

          <p>Using appreciative inquiry is a great way to encourage people to imagine a positive outcome and would be a good way to engage people to think about Trust values.</p>

          <p>In scenario three the new Director for Quality and Nursing visits your stand at Trust induction. Besides inviting him to become a member of the library what knowledge mobilisation technique might you suggest?</p>

          <p>Using the self-assessment tool with newly appointed senior staff is a great way to have a conversation about the wide range of services that you can offer and put in place some actions to help them make improve the way they use evidence and knowledge</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What next?</p>

          <p>The next bite sized sessions will explore some of the knowledge mobilisation techniques in more detail, make suggestions for how to get started and provide examples of how they have been used by other knowledge specialists.

          <p>The slides and script from the second bite-size video on Learning Before.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title page</p>

          <p>Welcome to the second video in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge where we will look in more detail at some Learning Before techniques.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Effectively sharing knowledge</p>

          <p>Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the know-how of staff, using research evidence and implementing best practice are all business critical. The Knowledge Mobilisation Framework emphasizes learning throughout the an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after. It provides a set of tools and techniques that are simple and quick to use that people can integrate into their daily practice, to encourage continual learning, replication of good practice and avoidance of pitfalls. The tools and techniques facilitate learning and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.</p>

          <p>It is a cyclical process – learning before can lead to learning during and learning after which then feeds back into learning before.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Learning before</p>

          <p>By improving learning before you consider who has done similar work before? Who has worked with this client before? Where have we similar skills?</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Self assessment tool</p>

          <p>The self-assessment tool is a simple framework has been developed to quickly assess how a team or health organisation can make better use of knowledge as an asset. Often referred to as “The Board Tool” this framework enables a dialogue between a representative of a library and knowledge service and senior executives in a health organisation to see how they are currently using external evidence and organisational knowledge and to devise an action plan to help the organisation develop best practice with targeted support.</p>

          <p>The technique takes approximately 1 hour to use and helps to open up dialogue about the range of services the local library and knowledge team can offer to help the organisation meet their objectives.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Self-assessment tool in action</p>

          <p>Rachel Cooke has used the self-assessment tool in her Trust, Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust. It has transformed the way her team works with the Medical Division. Rachel says:</p>

          <p>“I used the evidence and knowledge self-assessment tool with the Medical Division at Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust. They found the tool easy to use and were enthusiastic about the opportunities it presented. As a result of using the tool a member of my team now regularly attends the Divisional Board Meeting to respond to knowledge and evidence needs that arise during the meeting and act as guardians for ensuring divisional policies are fully evidence based, updated and easy to access.”</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Peer assist</p>

          <p>A Peer Assist is a structured facilitated meeting or workshop where people are invited from other business units or other businesses to provide their experience, insights and knowledge to a team who have requested help.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the peer assist session it is important to appoint a facilitator as well as circulating background information including purpose and objectives of the meeting.</p>

          <p>There are four stages to the peer assist.</p>

          <ol>
           <li>The home team present context, history and plans for the future and what they hope to get out of the meeting.</li>
           <li>Visitors ask question and provide feedback about what worked well for them and what could have been done better.</li>
           <li>The Home team analyses and reflects on what’s been learned and examines options.</li>
           <li>Finally, the visitors present feedback answer questions and agree actions with the home team.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The duration of the process is usually half a day. The teams benefit by gaining insight into how someone else has approached something and confirming an approach that was taken.</p>

           <li>What can be learned from similar situations and past projects from elsewhere?</li>
           <li>What will deliver success?</li>
           <li>What are the actions we need to take to avoid problems and apply good practice?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>It can be run in as little as 15 minutes.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Appreciative Inquiry</p>

          <p>Within appreciative inquiry the focus is on seeing the world differently. Participants are invited to celebrate what is working well, analyse why and then to imagine the best possible future outcome and how to achieve it. The process often involves creative expression of the future outcome.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use learning before techniques</p>

          <p>Think about a recent enquiry you have received or about a key priority for your organisation – could you recommend a learning before tool to help the use of evidence and knowledge?</p>

          <p>To get you started think about the following scenarios – how would you introduce a learning before tool</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Putting it to the test</p>

          <p>Which learning before tool might you use in the following situations?</p>

          <p>In scenario one we imagine that we are supplying an article about new virtual fracture clinics, you notice from the abstract that these have been introduced successfully in a London Trust. What could you share with your requestor to encourage them to learn more?</p>

          <p>A Peer Assist will enable one team to learn from another team who have put something similar into place. In this instance you may want to suggest to the person requesting the article that they may like to set up a peer assist with the team from the London Trust to learn more about how they set up the fracture clinic. You could offer to facilitate the session for them.</p>

          <p>In scenario 2 you discover that the Trust are planning to refresh the Trust values. What technique could you share with the person leading this work?</p>

          <p>Using appreciative inquiry is a great way to encourage people to imagine a positive outcome and would be a good way to engage people to think about Trust values.</p>

          <p>In scenario three the new Director for Quality and Nursing visits your stand at Trust induction. Besides inviting him to become a member of the library what knowledge mobilisation technique might you suggest?</p>

          <p>Using the self-assessment tool with newly appointed senior staff is a great way to have a conversation about the wide range of services that you can offer and put in place some actions to help them make improve the way they use evidence and knowledge</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What next?</p>

          <p>The next bite sized sessions will explore some of the knowledge mobilisation techniques in more detail, make suggestions for how to get started and provide examples of how they have been used by other knowledge specialists.

          <p>These are the slides and transcript from the third video in the mobilising evidence and knowledge bite-size series entitled "Learning During"</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title slide</p>

          <p>Welcome to the third video in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge where we will look in more detail at some Learning During techniques</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Effectively sharing knowledge</p>

          <p>Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the know-how of staff, using research evidence and implementing best practice are all business critical. The Knowledge Mobilisation Framework emphasizes learning throughout the an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after. It provides a set of tools and techniques that are simple and quick to use that people can integrate into their daily practice, to encourage continual learning, replication of good practice and avoidance of pitfalls. The tools and techniques facilitate learning and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.</p>

          <p>It is a cyclical process – learning before can lead to learning during and learning after which then feeds back into learning before</p>

          <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/" target="_blank">Learn more</a>&nbsp;about the knowledge mobilisation framework.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Learning during</p>

          <p>There are seven techniques in this ‘Learning During’ section of the framework. These are approaches that help us to consider learning that is taking place during a piece of work, to share experiences and build partnerships.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>After action reviews</p>

          <p>This is a quick and simple technique – based around four basic questions.</p>

          <p>Usually a short structured meeting held immediately after an activity – maybe a training session, or following a ‘go live ‘ day, at the Study stage of taking an initiative through the Plan Do Study Act Improvement cycle. Usually facilitated by one of the team members, the trick is to invite everyone involved in the ‘action’ to participate in the After Action Review. You only need 10 to 15 minutes to capture lessons learnt that can be put into practice immediately. So this is not about waiting to pull things apart at the end of a very large project but for really taking stock after a relatively short term activity that could be part of a much bigger programme.</p>

          <p>For longer pieces of work you might take longer.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>After action review: a case study</p>

          <p>We introduced this technique at a workshop for colleagues working across primary care. Farzana put the After Action review technique to work straight away.</p>

          <p>She has found it helpful in several different settings - for event analyses, staff performance meetings and CQC inspections and particularly favours in her words the "golden question" Why was there a difference? As it is much less judgemental than why did it happen. It shifts the conversation away from Blame and instead the focus is on learning.</p>

          <p>As Farzana explains: “Using such simple questions can help the regulatory primary care CQC process feel kinder and more humane”</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge Cafes</p>

          <p>Knowledge cafes are a great way to encourage productive conversations and allow people learn from each other. The value of the Cafe is in the conversation itself and the learning that each individual takes away. These Cafes can help people to solve problems - they help to break down silos, uncover actionable insights and so drive innovation and to build a community. Advance planning is key to running a café smoothly. . Time spent devising an open-ended question that will stimulate conversations and ensure participants can really get underneath the issues. Allow 1- 2 hours.</p>

          <p>Sarah Lewis has successfully facilitated Knowledge Cafes for her organisation. Follow the link to hear Sarah interviewing Daniel Leveson, Deputy Director of Strategy at Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust about his experience attending the Knowledge Cafe</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Community of Practice</p>

          <p>Building a community of practice brings people together who have a common purpose or shared interest where ideas and experience can be shared. The best communities of practice are nurtured to encourage interaction and keep the content relevant to group members. Often a community of practice maintains a set of knowledge assets or resources to support the learning taking place.</p>

          <p>A basic community of practice for those interested in knowledge management has been set up by colleagues in the HEE internal knowledge specialist team. To join follow the details on the Knowledge for Healthcare blog</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge assets</p>

          <p>A knowledge asset packages knowledge in one place to make it easy to use by other people. They may contain key lessons learned, case histories, key contacts, best practice and published documents organised and curated to make them easy to re-use.</p>

          <p>Katie Nicholas, Knowledge Specialist with the Health Education England internal knowledge management team helped to create a knowledge asset of resources for champions supporting the armed forces community. The resource brings together lots of useful information from a range of different sources and uses Sway, an interactive reporting tool embedded onto webpages, to help organise the information based upon themes in a set of Evidence Summaries also prepared by the team. You can find out more about this knowledge asset by visiting the knowledge management toolkit on the Knowledge for Healthcare Blog.</p>

          <p>Have a look at an example with the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/armed-forces-champions-resource" title="Armed forces champions resource" target="_blank">Armed Forces Champions Resource</a></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Action Learning Sets</p>

          <p>Meeting regularly as a small group these provide a safe-space for people to bring real life issues. The postcard sets out a standard structure you can use and the focus is on using coaching techniques, posing open questions to identify and trial actions to overcome issues.</p>

          <p>Alison Day has been working with colleagues in the Organisational Development Team at The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate action learning sets for individuals taking part in a senior leadership development programme.</p>

          <p>Transcript: The organisational development team were looking for more people to facilitate action learning sets as part of their senior leadership development programme. I had taken part in action learning sets before and found them a really helpful way to learn from other people and find solutions to overcome work blocks and to support my own development. I had six middle leaders drawn from two local Trusts attend the five sets I facilitated. My job as facilitator was to keep the group focused on the structure of the set and to avoid the temptation to jump in with solutions before individuals had had an opportunity to fully explore the issue via a series of open coaching style questions. It was also important to create an environment where all participants were able to take away learning and where actions to put the learning into place were agreed, trialled and then discussed at the next action learning set.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Randomised Coffee Trials</p>

          <p>Randomised Coffee Trials are short and fun. You randomly match people to have a conversation with each other. It’s a great technique to strengthen networks, bring different disciplines together, irrespective of role. You’re simply asking people to pair up and talk for 30 minutes whether by skype/ phone or face to face. Displayed is some feedback following a Randomised Coffee Trial that took place at Royal Bournemouth &amp; Christchurch Hospitals NHS FT</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Fishbowl conversations</p>

          <p>Fishbowl conversations are a useful technique for debating “hot topics” or sharing ideas and knowledge from a variety of perspectives. They can be used as an alternative to the traditional panel discussion or debate enabling more dynamic participation</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use learning during techniques</p>

          <p>Think about a recent enquiry you have received or about a key priority for your organisation – could you recommend a learning during tool to help the use of evidence and knowledge? To get you started think about the following scenarios – how would you introduce a learning during tool</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Putting it to the test</p>

          <p>Which learning during tool might you use in the following situations?</p>

          <p>In scenario one you are asked if you can provide a room for a small team to meet in to prepare new care pathways for rheumatology. Can you think of a knowledge mobilisation technique you might be able to offer this group? You could offer several knowledge mobilisation techniques to support this group including offering an embedded knowledge specialist to join the group to proactively source evidence to inform the new pathways. You may also offer a horizon scan or bulletin to keep the team updated about the latest evidence and may suggest that they use the simple questions from the After Action Review to reflect upon the work and make changes to their approach as they go along.</p>

          <p>In scenario two you are asked to share information about the library and knowledge service with a group of newly qualified nurses. Is there a knowledge mobilisation technique you could also highlight to the practice educator? You may want to offer a range of options to the Practice Educator - perhaps offer to help facilitate some action learning sets, organise a knowledge cafe or fishbowl conversation, set up a horizon scan or bulletin or you may help to set up a community of practice to bring the group together to learn from each other and maybe develop a specialist webpage, sharepoint area or intranet page specifically for this group to share their learning.</p>

          <p>Scenario three is a follow-up from providing a research paper where you discover that a study day will be taking place. In addition to having a stand to promote the evidence search service what other learning during technique could you offer? As the organiser is particularly keen to get people to meet you may share with them the idea of holding a randomised coffee trial as this is a great way to encourage participants at an event to go and speak to someone they have not met before.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What next?</p>

          <p>The next bite sized sessions will explore some of the knowledge mobilisation techniques in more detail, make suggestions for how to get started and provide examples of how they have been used by other knowledge specialists. For further examples visit the KM Toolkit.</p>

You may also offer a horizon scan or bulletin to keep the team updated about the latest evidence and may suggest that they use the simple questions from the After Action Review to reflect upon the work and make changes to their approach as they go along.</p>

          <p>In scenario two you are asked to share information about the library and knowledge service with a group of newly qualified nurses. Is there a knowledge mobilisation technique you could also highlight to the practice educator? You may want to offer a range of options to the Practice Educator - perhaps offer to help facilitate some action learning sets, organise a knowledge cafe or fishbowl conversation, set up a horizon scan or bulletin or you may help to set up a community of practice to bring the group together to learn from each other and maybe develop a specialist webpage, sharepoint area or intranet page specifically for this group to share their learning.</p>

          <p>Scenario three is a follow-up from providing a research paper where you discover that a study day will be taking place. In addition to having a stand to promote the evidence search service what other learning during technique could you offer? As the organiser is particularly keen to get people to meet you may share with them the idea of holding a randomised coffee trial as this is a great way to encourage participants at an event to go and speak to someone they have not met before.</p>

          <p>The next bite sized sessions will explore some of the knowledge mobilisation techniques in more detail, make suggestions for how to get started and provide examples of how they have been used by other knowledge specialists. For further examples visit the KM Toolkit.</p>

          <p>These are the slides and transcript from the third video in the mobilising evidence and knowledge bite-size series entitled "Learning During"</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title slide</p>

          <p>Welcome to the third video in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge where we will look in more detail at some Learning During techniques</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Effectively sharing knowledge</p>

          <p>Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the know-how of staff, using research evidence and implementing best practice are all business critical. The Knowledge Mobilisation Framework emphasizes learning throughout the an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after. It provides a set of tools and techniques that are simple and quick to use that people can integrate into their daily practice, to encourage continual learning, replication of good practice and avoidance of pitfalls. The tools and techniques facilitate learning and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.</p>

          <p>It is a cyclical process – learning before can lead to learning during and learning after which then feeds back into learning before</p>

          <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/knowledge-mobilisation-framework/" target="_blank">Learn more</a>&nbsp;about the knowledge mobilisation framework.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Learning during</p>

          <p>There are seven techniques in this ‘Learning During’ section of the framework. These are approaches that help us to consider learning that is taking place during a piece of work, to share experiences and build partnerships.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>After action reviews</p>

          <p>This is a quick and simple technique – based around four basic questions.</p>

          <p>Usually a short structured meeting held immediately after an activity – maybe a training session, or following a ‘go live ‘ day, at the Study stage of taking an initiative through the Plan Do Study Act Improvement cycle. Usually facilitated by one of the team members, the trick is to invite everyone involved in the ‘action’ to participate in the After Action Review. You only need 10 to 15 minutes to capture lessons learnt that can be put into practice immediately. So this is not about waiting to pull things apart at the end of a very large project but for really taking stock after a relatively short term activity that could be part of a much bigger programme.</p>

          <p>For longer pieces of work you might take longer.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>After action review: a case study</p>

          <p>We introduced this technique at a workshop for colleagues working across primary care. Farzana put the After Action review technique to work straight away.</p>

          <p>She has found it helpful in several different settings - for event analyses, staff performance meetings and CQC inspections and particularly favours in her words the "golden question" Why was there a difference? As it is much less judgemental than why did it happen. It shifts the conversation away from Blame and instead the focus is on learning.</p>

          <p>As Farzana explains: “Using such simple questions can help the regulatory primary care CQC process feel kinder and more humane”</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge Cafes</p>

          <p>Knowledge cafes are a great way to encourage productive conversations and allow people learn from each other. The value of the Cafe is in the conversation itself and the learning that each individual takes away. These Cafes can help people to solve problems - they help to break down silos, uncover actionable insights and so drive innovation and to build a community. Advance planning is key to running a café smoothly. . Time spent devising an open-ended question that will stimulate conversations and ensure participants can really get underneath the issues. Allow 1- 2 hours.</p>

          <p>Sarah Lewis has successfully facilitated Knowledge Cafes for her organisation. Follow the link to hear Sarah interviewing Daniel Leveson, Deputy Director of Strategy at Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust about his experience attending the Knowledge Cafe</p>

          <p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMjnzavzBis" target="_blank">BHT Impact of Knowledge cafes 2019</a></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Community of Practice</p>

          <p>Building a community of practice brings people together who have a common purpose or shared interest where ideas and experience can be shared. The best communities of practice are nurtured to encourage interaction and keep the content relevant to group members. Often a community of practice maintains a set of knowledge assets or resources to support the learning taking place.</p>

          <p>A basic community of practice for those interested in knowledge management has been set up by colleagues in the HEE internal knowledge specialist team. To join follow the details on the Knowledge for Healthcare blog</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge assets</p>

          <p>A knowledge asset packages knowledge in one place to make it easy to use by other people. They may contain key lessons learned, case histories, key contacts, best practice and published documents organised and curated to make them easy to re-use.</p>

          <p>Katie Nicholas, Knowledge Specialist with the Health Education England internal knowledge management team helped to create a knowledge asset of resources for champions supporting the armed forces community. The resource brings together lots of useful information from a range of different sources and uses Sway, an interactive reporting tool embedded onto webpages, to help organise the information based upon themes in a set of Evidence Summaries also prepared by the team. You can find out more about this knowledge asset by visiting the knowledge management toolkit on the Knowledge for Healthcare Blog.</p>

          <p>Have a look at an example with the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/armed-forces-champions-resource" title="Armed forces champions resource" target="_blank">Armed Forces Champions Resource</a></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Action Learning Sets</p>

          <p>Meeting regularly as a small group these provide a safe-space for people to bring real life issues. The postcard sets out a standard structure you can use and the focus is on using coaching techniques, posing open questions to identify and trial actions to overcome issues.</p>

          <p>Alison Day has been working with colleagues in the Organisational Development Team at The Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate action learning sets for individuals taking part in a senior leadership development programme.</p>

          <p>Transcript: The organisational development team were looking for more people to facilitate action learning sets as part of their senior leadership development programme. I had taken part in action learning sets before and found them a really helpful way to learn from other people and find solutions to overcome work blocks and to support my own development. I had six middle leaders drawn from two local Trusts attend the five sets I facilitated. My job as facilitator was to keep the group focused on the structure of the set and to avoid the temptation to jump in with solutions before individuals had had an opportunity to fully explore the issue via a series of open coaching style questions. It was also important to create an environment where all participants were able to take away learning and where actions to put the learning into place were agreed, trialled and then discussed at the next action learning set.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Randomised Coffee Trials</p>

          <p>Randomised Coffee Trials are short and fun. You randomly match people to have a conversation with each other. It’s a great technique to strengthen networks, bring different disciplines together, irrespective of role. You’re simply asking people to pair up and talk for 30 minutes whether by skype/ phone or face to face. Displayed is some feedback following a Randomised Coffee Trial that took place at Royal Bournemouth &amp; Christchurch Hospitals NHS FT</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Fishbowl conversations</p>

          <p>Fishbowl conversations are a useful technique for debating “hot topics” or sharing ideas and knowledge from a variety of perspectives. They can be used as an alternative to the traditional panel discussion or debate enabling more dynamic participation</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use learning during techniques</p>

          <p>Think about a recent enquiry you have received or about a key priority for your organisation – could you recommend a learning during tool to help the use of evidence and knowledge? To get you started think about the following scenarios – how would you introduce a learning during tool</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Putting it to the test</p>

          <p>Which learning during tool might you use in the following situations?</p>

          <p>In scenario one you are asked if you can provide a room for a small team to meet in to prepare new care pathways for rheumatology. Can you think of a knowledge mobilisation technique you might be able to offer this group? You could offer several knowledge mobilisation techniques to support this group including offering an embedded knowledge specialist to join the group to proactively source evidence to inform the new pathways. You may also offer a horizon scan or bulletin to keep the team updated about the latest evidence and may suggest that they use the simple questions from the After Action Review to reflect upon the work and make changes to their approach as they go along.</p>

          <p>In scenario two you are asked to share information about the library and knowledge service with a group of newly qualified nurses. Is there a knowledge mobilisation technique you could also highlight to the practice educator? You may want to offer a range of options to the Practice Educator - perhaps offer to help facilitate some action learning sets, organise a knowledge cafe or fishbowl conversation, set up a horizon scan or bulletin or you may help to set up a community of practice to bring the group together to learn from each other and maybe develop a specialist webpage, sharepoint area or intranet page specifically for this group to share their learning.</p>

          <p>Scenario three is a follow-up from providing a research paper where you discover that a study day will be taking place. In addition to having a stand to promote the evidence search service what other learning during technique could you offer? As the organiser is particularly keen to get people to meet you may share with them the idea of holding a randomised coffee trial as this is a great way to encourage participants at an event to go and speak to someone they have not met before.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The next bite sized sessions will explore some of the knowledge mobilisation techniques in more detail, make suggestions for how to get started and provide examples of how they have been used by other knowledge specialists. For further examples visit the KM Toolkit.</p>

          <p>Here are the slides and the transcript from the fourth video in the mobilising evidence and knowledge bite size series entitled "Learning After"</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title slide</p>

          <p>Welcome to the fourth and last video in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge where we will look in more detail at some Learning After techniques.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Effectively sharing knowledge</p>

          <p>Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the know-how of staff, using research evidence and implementing best practice are all business critical. The Knowledge Mobilisation Framework emphasizes learning throughout the an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after. It provides a set of tools and techniques that are simple and quick to use that people can integrate into their daily practice, to encourage continual learning, replication of good practice and avoidance of pitfalls. The tools and techniques facilitate learning and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.</p>

          <p>It is a cyclical process – learning before can lead to learning during and learning after which then feeds back into learning before</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Learning After</p>

          <p>Learning After techniques ask us to consider what did we actually deliver? What did we achieve?</p>

          <p>Did the outcome differ our goal? What went well? What went not so well? How will we retain knowledge when from people move on to new roles?</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Retrospect</p>

          <p>Retrospect has a similar structure to the After Action Review but is a longer version right at the end of a piece of work so you can capture the knowledge before the project team disbands. You would usually invite a beneficiary of the knowledge and lessons being learned to participate. Particularly powerful is the final stage - marking a piece of work out of 10 and considering what would have made it a 10 to identify key learning to pass onto others as knowledge assets that can be accessed at anytime or from any location.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Retrospect: In Action</p>

          <p>You can see the benefits of holding a retrospect by viewing the video clips within the Retrospect Module of the e-learning – free to access online from the link shown</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Knowledge harvesting</p>

          <p>This technique is framed around knowledge retention.</p>

          <p>What happens when valuable members of staff move on? It is not just about staff leaving but also useful at end of projects and when secondments end and helpful when new people start to help get people up-to-speed more quickly.</p>

          <p>The key is to start early, ask the right questions and decide how to package the knowledge to make it useful for others – not collecting everything but ensuring key learning is captured for re-use.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The Leaver's Toolkit</p>

          <p>The Leaver’s Toolkit presents a range of knowledge transfer activities that a leaver can adopt to capture and pass on their knowledge and learning.</p>

          <p>At Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust the Library &amp; Knowledge Services Manager delivers a 30 minute session, Valuing your Knowledge Legacy, on a preparing for retirement workshop for Trust staff. The session encourages participants to think about the unique work-related knowledge they have and discusses ways of sharing this with others in their team</p>

          <p><a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/knowledge-mobilisation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/knowledge-retention-and-transition-toolkit">Take a look at the Leaver's Toolkit</a></p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use learning after techniques</p>

          <p>Think about a recent enquiry you have received or about a key priority for your organisation – could you recommend a learning after tool to help the use of evidence and knowledge?</p>

          <p>To get you started think about the following scenarios – how would you introduce a learning after tool</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Putting it to the test</p>

          <p>Which learning after tool might you use in the following situations? In scenario one you receive an enquiry about continued use of the library service from a matron who is transferring to work for the newly formed Integrated Care System.</p>

          <p>In addition to explaining how she can continue to access library services you may also offer a bulletin of the latest evidence to keep her updated and informed and may share with her the tools from the Leavers Toolkit so that she can transfer key learning from her existing role to others in the team</p>

          <p>In scenario two You are asked to source some articles by a project team implementing a new IT system. When you send the articles you may also send details about the technique of retrospect so when they reach the end of their project key lessons and learning can be captured and shared with others doing similar work in future.</p>

          <p>In scenario three a chance conversation whilst a new manager comes to join the library uncovers that they need some additional help to get to grips with working in the NHS (they are new to this sector). You may share some information about the NHS or offer a bulletin to keep them updated in their field of interest. However, if you have previously used the leavers’ toolkit with the outgoing manager then there will be valuable knowledge that has been captures and which can be used by the new manager. Knowledge used in this way is often described as rapid on-boarding.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>What next?</p>

You would usually invite a beneficiary of the knowledge and lessons being learned to participate. Particularly powerful is the final stage - marking a piece of work out of 10 and considering what would have made it a 10 to identify key learning to pass onto others as knowledge assets that can be accessed at anytime or from any location.</p>

          <p>Knowledge harvesting</p>

          <p>This technique is framed around knowledge retention.</p>

          <p>What happens when valuable members of staff move on? It is not just about staff leaving but also useful at end of projects and when secondments end and helpful when new people start to help get people up-to-speed more quickly.</p>

          <p>The key is to start early, ask the right questions and decide how to package the knowledge to make it useful for others – not collecting everything but ensuring key learning is captured for re-use.</p>

          <p>The Leaver’s Toolkit presents a range of knowledge transfer activities that a leaver can adopt to capture and pass on their knowledge and learning.</p>

          <p>At Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust the Library &amp; Knowledge Services Manager delivers a 30 minute session, Valuing your Knowledge Legacy, on a preparing for retirement workshop for Trust staff. The session encourages participants to think about the unique work-related knowledge they have and discusses ways of sharing this with others in their team</p>

          <p>Opportunities to use learning after techniques</p>

          <p>Think about a recent enquiry you have received or about a key priority for your organisation – could you recommend a learning after tool to help the use of evidence and knowledge?</p>

          <p>To get you started think about the following scenarios – how would you introduce a learning after tool</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Putting it to the test</p>

          <p>Which learning after tool might you use in the following situations? In scenario one you receive an enquiry about continued use of the library service from a matron who is transferring to work for the newly formed Integrated Care System.</p>

          <p>In addition to explaining how she can continue to access library services you may also offer a bulletin of the latest evidence to keep her updated and informed and may share with her the tools from the Leavers Toolkit so that she can transfer key learning from her existing role to others in the team</p>

          <p>In scenario two You are asked to source some articles by a project team implementing a new IT system. When you send the articles you may also send details about the technique of retrospect so when they reach the end of their project key lessons and learning can be captured and shared with others doing similar work in future.</p>

          <p>In scenario three a chance conversation whilst a new manager comes to join the library uncovers that they need some additional help to get to grips with working in the NHS (they are new to this sector). You may share some information about the NHS or offer a bulletin to keep them updated in their field of interest. However, if you have previously used the leavers’ toolkit with the outgoing manager then there will be valuable knowledge that has been captures and which can be used by the new manager. Knowledge used in this way is often described as rapid on-boarding.</p>

          <p>Here are the slides and the transcript from the fourth video in the mobilising evidence and knowledge bite size series entitled "Learning After"</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Title slide</p>

          <p>Welcome to the fourth and last video in our short series of bite-sized introductions about mobilising evidence and knowledge where we will look in more detail at some Learning After techniques.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Effectively sharing knowledge</p>

          <p>Healthcare is a knowledge based industry. Sharing the know-how of staff, using research evidence and implementing best practice are all business critical. The Knowledge Mobilisation Framework emphasizes learning throughout the an activity’s lifecycle: learning before, during and after. It provides a set of tools and techniques that are simple and quick to use that people can integrate into their daily practice, to encourage continual learning, replication of good practice and avoidance of pitfalls. The tools and techniques facilitate learning and support strategic planning, operational delivery and sustainability.</p>

          <p>It is a cyclical process – learning before can lead to learning during and learning after which then feeds back into learning before</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Learning After</p>

          <p>Learning After techniques ask us to consider what did we actually deliver? What did we achieve?</p>

          <p>Did the outcome differ our goal? What went well? What went not so well? How will we retain knowledge when from people move on to new roles?</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Retrospect</p>

          <p>Retrospect has a similar structure to the After Action Review but is a longer version right at the end of a piece of work so you can capture the knowledge before the project team disbands. You would usually invite a beneficiary of the knowledge and lessons being learned to participate. Particularly powerful is the final stage - marking a piece of work out of 10 and considering what would have made it a 10 to identify key learning to pass onto others as knowledge assets that can be accessed at anytime or from any location.</p>

          <p>Knowledge harvesting</p>

          <p>This technique is framed around knowledge retention.</p>

          <p>What happens when valuable members of staff move on? It is not just about staff leaving but also useful at end of projects and when secondments end and helpful when new people start to help get people up-to-speed more quickly.</p>

          <p>I'm going to allow um Natasha and Hong-Anh to introduce themselves um so that they can tell us about the work</p>

          <p>that they do and</p>

          <p>why they're involved in this um</p>

          <p>conversation</p>

          <p>okay um would you like me to go first</p>

          <p>holly</p>

          <p>please do it yeah okay so hI everyone so</p>

          <p>I’m Natasha Howard</p>

          <p>I’m library and knowledge services</p>

          <p>manager at NELFT north east london</p>

          <p>electric foundation trust</p>

          <p>um now I know many of you don't know me</p>

          <p>um some of you are dialing in so you</p>

          <p>can't see me</p>

          <p>I’m not black I’m mixed race or biracial</p>

          <p>so I’m roughly half</p>

          <p>black Afro Caribbean and half white</p>

          <p>english</p>

          <p>my mum was born in Jamaica and in the</p>

          <p>70s the government paid for her to come</p>

          <p>over here to change to be a nurse</p>

          <p>she did her training in Bath and then</p>

          <p>she went to Essex and did whisper training</p>

          <p>and that's where she met my dad so I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>always thought of myself as being half</p>

          <p>Essex half Jamaican</p>

          <p>I’m descended from enslaved people and</p>

          <p>to their enslavers</p>

          <p>but I’m not a spokesperson for black</p>

          <p>people that monolithic group that seems</p>

          <p>to exist in</p>

          <p>your imagination I want to be upfront</p>

          <p>about this because</p>

          <p>we all need to be able to acknowledge</p>

          <p>the privileges that we have</p>

          <p>and um I need to acknowledge the</p>

          <p>privilege the advantage that comes from</p>

          <p>having</p>

          <p>this lighter skin what some people call</p>

          <p>proximity to whiteness</p>

          <p>and it doesn't end there my other great</p>

          <p>privileges include a comfortable</p>

          <p>upbringing</p>

          <p>and fantastic education and we still</p>

          <p>have grammar schools in Essex and i</p>

          <p>passed my 11 plus I went to grammar</p>

          <p>school</p>

          <p>and then I went to King's College London</p>

          <p>now partly because of where I grew up</p>

          <p>and partly because I’m fortunate to have</p>

          <p>a wonderful extended uh family who are</p>

          <p>very loving I’ve never experienced the</p>

          <p>kind of overt</p>

          <p>violent um aggressive racism that many</p>

          <p>people would think of as being proper</p>

          <p>racist</p>

          <p>I’ve always known I was a target as a</p>

          <p>child my dad told me to be careful when</p>

          <p>we were in shops</p>

          <p>keep my hands visible because people</p>

          <p>would think I was going to shoplift</p>

          <p>because I’m brown</p>

          <p>even now if I go into a shop I always</p>

          <p>get a basket if I can't get a basket i</p>

          <p>walk around like this</p>

          <p>like I’m waiting on tables in my hands</p>

          <p>and I just don't even think about</p>

          <p>it when I was six my mom told me i'd</p>

          <p>have to work twice as hard as everyone</p>

          <p>else to get anywhere</p>

          <p>because of the colour of my skin at the</p>

          <p>time I really wasn't that bothered</p>

          <p>because I knew I was a hard worker</p>

          <p>and I was very bright so I just got on</p>

          <p>with it</p>

          <p>and for a long time I naively believed</p>

          <p>that we lived in a meritocracy and that</p>

          <p>part of hard work would pay off</p>

          <p>that our society was post-racial</p>

          <p>perhaps there was some pockets of</p>

          <p>ignorance</p>

          <p>that they are very isolated life started</p>

          <p>to change when my son was born six years</p>

          <p>ago</p>

          <p>he was two weeks early and we were kept</p>

          <p>on the postnatal ward so he could have</p>

          <p>iv antibiotics twice a day</p>

          <p>after we've been there for a few days i</p>

          <p>knew something wasn't right and I kept</p>

          <p>asking the right to midwives if he was</p>

          <p>okay</p>

          <p>they said he was fine his nappies were</p>

          <p>weird and</p>

          <p>they said they were normal it was only</p>

          <p>when it came to a weekend night shift</p>

          <p>and an Indian nurse was starting the</p>

          <p>neonatal unit and doing his iv</p>

          <p>antibiotics and she said to me</p>

          <p>your baby's a little bit jaundiced I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>taken a sample to check</p>

          <p>and a few hours later everything kicked</p>

          <p>off because the results showed that his</p>

          <p>he was really really jaundiced really</p>

          <p>dehydrated in a bad way</p>

          <p>but he was whisked off to the neonatal</p>

          <p>unit and it was nearly two weeks before</p>

          <p>I could take him home</p>

          <p>I was six years ago and he's fine now</p>

          <p>but that's just one example of how</p>

          <p>racism and health care affected outcomes</p>

          <p>the concerns of this very articulate</p>

          <p>educated women were repeatedly ignored</p>

          <p>and the white staff didn't know how to</p>

          <p>support children for non-white babies</p>

          <p>I guess I started to wake up to reality</p>

          <p>I started doing more reading so i</p>

          <p>realized that I had this duty to</p>

          <p>leverage my privilege to facilitate</p>

          <p>change</p>

          <p>but I have engaged with my trust's</p>

          <p>long-standing ethnic minority network</p>

          <p>and I’m now a interview colour rep for</p>

          <p>the network and also strategic</p>

          <p>ambassador</p>

          <p>like we know librarianship is &nbsp;white</p>

          <p>until our profession reflects the</p>

          <p>communities we serve we're not going to</p>

          <p>be equipped to meet their needs</p>

          <p>it's going to take a while to change</p>

          <p>those figures but I think in the</p>

          <p>meantime we all have a duty to</p>

          <p>participate ourselves on EDI</p>

          <p>issues in the broadest sense and how</p>

          <p>they manifest in our work</p>

          <p>and then we can start to act so thanks</p>

          <p>for taking the time to engage with us on</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>thanks Natasha um Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>are you there hold on</p>

          <p>she seems to have disappeared</p>

          <p>oh there you are ah sorry</p>

          <p>um I’m Hong-Anh Nguyen I am the library</p>

          <p>service manager at the kings fund</p>

          <p>so um I guess I work in a health library</p>

          <p>but</p>

          <p>probably not in uh the kind of way that</p>

          <p>most people think about health libraries</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>our collection is focused on health</p>

          <p>and social care policy and management</p>

          <p>and so um like Natasha said and so eloquently said</p>

          <p>um I think one of the things that is</p>

          <p>really important for</p>

          <p>me to clock in my introduction is that</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>this session is about black lives</p>

          <p>matter and</p>

          <p>as you can see I’m not black I am i</p>

          <p>would identify as a woman of colour</p>

          <p>person of colour BAME all of those are</p>

          <p>like words that I might use to describe</p>

          <p>myself just depending on</p>

          <p>the context or southeast Asian or</p>

          <p>Vietnamese</p>

          <p>um and the</p>

          <p>kind of experiences of</p>

          <p>discrimination or othering that I</p>

          <p>experienced</p>

          <p>are very different to the experiences</p>

          <p>of um Black or Asian</p>

          <p>or other ethnic minority people um</p>

          <p>I think it's just really important to</p>

          <p>kind of highlight</p>

          <p>that because um I think what black lives</p>

          <p>matter is really highlighted is that</p>

          <p>BAME isn't like a monolith</p>

          <p>it's an umbrella term that kind of</p>

          <p>covers a lot of experiences</p>

          <p>and for me how that showed up in my life</p>

          <p>is that um</p>

          <p>the southeast Asian community tends to</p>

          <p>be kind of part of what</p>

          <p>we call in this country like the model</p>

          <p>model minority</p>

          <p>um you might have also heard it referred</p>

          <p>to as like the good immigrant</p>

          <p>um as there is this kind of ex</p>

          <p>it kind of shows up as like an</p>

          <p>expectation that uh</p>

          <p>you're going to kind of be very perform</p>

          <p>really</p>

          <p>well academically that you will go into</p>

          <p>certain</p>

          <p>professions so like being a doctor or</p>

          <p>being a pharmacist</p>

          <p>or being a lawyer um</p>

          <p>and I think it's it's about uh</p>

          <p>kind of putting that identity in a box</p>

          <p>and making expectations</p>

          <p>of how they perform but when</p>

          <p>Black Lives Matter um when it kind of</p>

          <p>came to the attention of the world again</p>

          <p>over the past few weeks one of the</p>

          <p>things that really</p>

          <p>that I really kind of thought that was</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>the way that model minorities are used</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>as a tool of white supremacy like as a</p>

          <p>way</p>

          <p>to kind of um</p>

          <p>yes as a way to kind of oppress like</p>

          <p>other</p>

          <p>minority groups um so</p>

          <p>again there is like layers of privilege</p>

          <p>there that we have to think about</p>

          <p>um I guess the other thing I want to say</p>

          <p>is that my experience</p>

          <p>of talking and thinking and doing stuff</p>

          <p>around</p>

          <p>equality diversity and inclusion it's</p>

          <p>it's informed by my lived experience but</p>

          <p>it's really garnered from my</p>

          <p>professional experience so I’m involved</p>

          <p>in a lot of</p>

          <p>the king's funds uh diversity inclusion</p>

          <p>program</p>

          <p>and so I co-lead on a lot of the work</p>

          <p>that we do</p>

          <p>and I’m involved in lots of the</p>

          <p>initiatives so I’m part of the reverse</p>

          <p>mentoring program</p>

          <p>and uh I we introduced um</p>

          <p>a a positive action graduate trainee</p>

          <p>post</p>

          <p>for example so yes so um</p>

          <p>I guess I guess my disclaimer as it were</p>

          <p>would be that</p>

          <p>um and I’m sure Natasha would agree with</p>

          <p>this is</p>

          <p>that while we have experience in this</p>

          <p>field uh we don't have all the answers</p>

          <p>um there is no silver bullet for solving</p>

          <p>the issues that we're going to be</p>

          <p>talking about because if there were</p>

          <p>we wouldn't be having this discussion</p>

          <p>today so I think it's more to say that</p>

          <p>we're just sharing our experiences of</p>

          <p>how</p>

          <p>our journey has been so far in working</p>

          <p>in this area</p>

          <p>thank you that's great so um</p>

          <p>what we've done is we've taken the</p>

          <p>questions that you all are</p>

          <p>on slido and we've sort of grouped them</p>

          <p>together thematically because there were</p>

          <p>quite a lot</p>

          <p>of questions that um went together</p>

          <p>nicely so I’m going to ask Natasha and</p>

          <p>Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>these questions and then they're going</p>

          <p>to have a discussion and during that</p>

          <p>discussion if you want to make any</p>

          <p>further questions or comments please use</p>

          <p>the chat function</p>

          <p>so let's kick off with our first</p>

          <p>question how can library staff</p>

          <p>regardless of level or role</p>

          <p>affect positive change and influence</p>

          <p>upwards where resistance is being met</p>

          <p>tricky isn't it, this is a really good</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>and I’m sure one that both of us really</p>

          <p>relate to in our experience so far</p>

          <p>um I guess so I I guess</p>

          <p>resistance is often felt</p>

          <p>um downwards but resistance can be found</p>

          <p>in like</p>

          <p>all directions within an organization so</p>

          <p>it can be felt from your peers</p>

          <p>it can be felt from your managers from</p>

          <p>directors senior managers um</p>

          <p>so what I always think is that everyone</p>

          <p>is responsible for something right you</p>

          <p>you all have a job description you're</p>

          <p>all responsible for</p>

          <p>delivering an element or aspect of your</p>

          <p>service making certain decisions about</p>

          <p>your service</p>

          <p>that is power um so you have the power</p>

          <p>to make decisions</p>

          <p>that ultimately add up into</p>

          <p>change um if everyone kind of thinks</p>

          <p>about their power consciously so</p>

          <p>if if you're a cataloguer for example</p>

          <p>you might have the ability to kind of</p>

          <p>lead a discussion and lead a piece of</p>

          <p>thinking about</p>

          <p>do the class do the indexing terms we</p>

          <p>use reflect</p>

          <p>really um the languages used nowadays</p>

          <p>um around gender identity</p>

          <p>around race um</p>

          <p>you know that's that's one thing that</p>

          <p>you can do you can't do everything</p>

          <p>but the things that you can do are</p>

          <p>change</p>

          <p>um so that would be my first thought on</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>Natasha what do you think</p>

          <p>yeah I think some different examples</p>

          <p>I’ve seen of training sessions as well</p>

          <p>if you're helping people learn to search</p>

          <p>databases you can use examples that</p>

          <p>speak to</p>

          <p>different aspects whether they're things</p>

          <p>to do with race</p>

          <p>or things to do with issues like um</p>

          <p>domestic violence and that kind of thing</p>

          <p>and so just even from including those</p>

          <p>examples when you're saying</p>

          <p>people it's just starting to broaden out</p>

          <p>the thinking a little bit more</p>

          <p>um the other one</p>

          <p>um I was thinking of is about sharing</p>

          <p>good practice from elsewhere</p>

          <p>like maybe your boss doesn't want to do</p>

          <p>it but there's nothing to stop you</p>

          <p>talking about</p>

          <p>what everyone else is doing or what</p>

          <p>someone else is doing</p>

          <p>and you know if it gets talked about</p>

          <p>enough um</p>

          <p>there will be um there will be that</p>

          <p>pressure to do something</p>

          <p>yeah and also I mean particularly for</p>

          <p>the nhs</p>

          <p>there's an aspect of um accountability</p>

          <p>as well so</p>

          <p>you know you've got the workforce race</p>

          <p>equality standard</p>

          <p>um which which are the measures that um</p>

          <p>that you know are applied nationally</p>

          <p>across the service in terms of measuring</p>

          <p>uh race disparity in the nhs and</p>

          <p>um that's not so there are kind of</p>

          <p>things that the nhs is required to do</p>

          <p>standards that they require to meet</p>

          <p>and so is there any way that you can</p>

          <p>kind of train your argument</p>

          <p>in terms of like this link to a</p>

          <p>strategic priority</p>

          <p>it might lead to a strategic equality in</p>

          <p>the nhs so you might link it to race</p>

          <p>data this is particularly personal when</p>

          <p>you're thinking about</p>

          <p>on workforce like when you're thinking</p>

          <p>about the makeup of your team</p>

          <p>um how people progress how you support</p>

          <p>career</p>

          <p>progression because the nhs is actually</p>

          <p>quite diverse but as you</p>

          <p>as you travel up that diversity doesn't</p>

          <p>translate in terms of race</p>

          <p>um and you know there are also kind of</p>

          <p>strategic priorities that your</p>

          <p>organization will have that your trust</p>

          <p>will have</p>

          <p>your trust will have I’m I’m pretty sure</p>

          <p>that all nhs trusts will have like</p>

          <p>some sort of EDI strategic objectives</p>

          <p>um and what what are those how can you</p>

          <p>kind of link it into those</p>

          <p>like you need to think about all of</p>

          <p>those things to kind of help make the</p>

          <p>business case</p>

          <p>almost um you kind of have to treat</p>

          <p>everything like it's a business case</p>

          <p>because the moral code alone sometimes</p>

          <p>won't win the day so sometimes you have</p>

          <p>to</p>

          <p>you have to put your librarian and do a</p>

          <p>bit of research and say here's the data</p>

          <p>this is why we should do it so</p>

          <p>um there's lots of data out there for</p>

          <p>example about why um</p>

          <p>not diversifying your workforce will</p>

          <p>result in um you know</p>

          <p>less a less rich pool of talent and then</p>

          <p>that has an economic impact on your</p>

          <p>organization</p>

          <p>you need to kind of yeah put your</p>

          <p>research hat on</p>

          <p>and and find what the what the kind of</p>

          <p>data is and what the argument is</p>

          <p>to do this kind of thing whatever the</p>

          <p>change is</p>

          <p>another one I was going to suggest is um</p>

          <p>about</p>

          <p>if you just have an ethnic minority or a</p>

          <p>black staff network</p>

          <p>it might be useful to link in with them</p>

          <p>because as Hong-Anh says</p>

          <p>there's strategic priorities around</p>

          <p>these issues you know if you're chair of</p>

          <p>your</p>

          <p>same network is saying where's the edi</p>

          <p>stuff in the library</p>

          <p>that's going to perhaps carry a bit more</p>

          <p>weight then and you sending it to</p>

          <p>your boss maybe yeah that's a really</p>

          <p>good shout out</p>

          <p>definitely yeah find yours what is your</p>

          <p>um peers in your organization find your</p>

          <p>supporters</p>

          <p>like you're trying to do things that</p>

          <p>you're just more distant</p>

          <p>you're not the only one who's trying to</p>

          <p>make this change so you need to try and</p>

          <p>find the other people and join up</p>

          <p>um and be strategic about it yeah</p>

          <p>so if for example you want to kind of</p>

          <p>diversify your collection</p>

          <p>um but you know there are budget</p>

          <p>constraints and there's a bit of</p>

          <p>resistance</p>

          <p>about it can you argue that it's good</p>

          <p>for self well-being can you argue that</p>

          <p>it links into kind of</p>

          <p>like greater thinking around health</p>

          <p>inequalities and how that interacts with</p>

          <p>race inequality</p>

          <p>and that's actually quite an important</p>

          <p>dimension to speak about because</p>

          <p>at a health policy level that's</p>

          <p>something that people are starting to</p>

          <p>think about you know</p>

          <p>you need to kind of cast your net</p>

          <p>quite broadly</p>

          <p>that's great I think that's that's a lot</p>

          <p>of practical</p>

          <p>steps that people can take to start</p>

          <p>thinking about how they</p>

          <p>affect that positive change upwards</p>

          <p>um I don't think we've got anything</p>

          <p>that's come from on the chat on that</p>

          <p>topic so she'll move on to our next</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>yeah yeah</p>

          <p>so and this has been a big one we had</p>

          <p>lots of um discussion about this on on</p>

          <p>slido what does it mean to decolonize a</p>

          <p>library in a healthcare</p>

          <p>context okay</p>

          <p>so um decolonization</p>

          <p>as I understand it is about sort of um</p>

          <p>changing the focus from</p>

          <p>um things that have been largely built</p>

          <p>and designed around</p>

          <p>cisgender white specific male</p>

          <p>white people and making things</p>

          <p>yeah more diverse so in</p>

          <p>our health care library I think there's</p>

          <p>lots of ways that we can do it</p>

          <p>um we can talk about collections but</p>

          <p>we've also talked about the training</p>

          <p>aspects as well uh raising awareness</p>

          <p>to those kind of examples um</p>

          <p>and yeah the um things that we've got</p>

          <p>over about the</p>

          <p>lack of diversity of images and stuff</p>

          <p>that's really topical at the moment I</p>

          <p>don't know people have seen on twitter</p>

          <p>there is a student at saint george's</p>

          <p>uh university who has um</p>

          <p>written a book about recognizing</p>

          <p>clinical signs in black and brown skin</p>

          <p>he's done it as part of a student</p>

          <p>project he's a medical student</p>

          <p>and this is being hailed as a big thing</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>it's a first over</p>

          <p>and that's kind of incredible when you</p>

          <p>think about it but</p>

          <p>this should be down to the unpaid labour</p>

          <p>of a</p>

          <p>medical student to reduce this kind of</p>

          <p>resource</p>

          <p>but these are the kind of things that</p>

          <p>we're thinking of um</p>

          <p>these pictures these resources should be</p>

          <p>more available</p>

          <p>and when we say decolonized we're not</p>

          <p>just talking about the race agenda we're</p>

          <p>talking about um</p>

          <p>gender we're talking about um lgbtq+</p>

          <p>issues as well</p>

          <p>and um which have a knock-on effect in</p>

          <p>health</p>

          <p>and health outcomes so it's really</p>

          <p>thinking wisely</p>

          <p>uh interrogating our collections what</p>

          <p>voices are being heard</p>

          <p>what voices aren't being heard and</p>

          <p>in the collections and in the terms that</p>

          <p>we use as Hong-Anh said earlier the index</p>

          <p>terms that we use as well</p>

          <p>yeah I think the example that you use of</p>

          <p>the um</p>

          <p>uh the medical students who've put</p>

          <p>together this resource I mean</p>

          <p>uh that absolutely shouldn't be</p>

          <p>something that someone has taken on as</p>

          <p>unpaid labour</p>

          <p>um and I guess my my challenge to us as</p>

          <p>the profession is as a profession we</p>

          <p>have significant economic power um when</p>

          <p>it comes to publishers for example what</p>

          <p>could we do to affect change</p>

          <p>as a whole profession of health care</p>

          <p>librarians when we're thinking about</p>

          <p>um what what's missing um</p>

          <p>so we know that in dermatology yeah like</p>

          <p>there are</p>

          <p>there are no uh there's no diversity</p>

          <p>in how skin conditions show up on</p>

          <p>different colour skins because they do</p>

          <p>present differently</p>

          <p>um a really pertinent example of this at</p>

          <p>the moment is um in Covid actually</p>

          <p>so one of the symptoms of clothing is a</p>

          <p>rash</p>

          <p>about 20% of covid patients present with</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>um but all the exams like the majority</p>

          <p>of the examples</p>

          <p>uh photographic examples we have of how this rash looks is on white skin</p>

          <p>and there are very little examples</p>

          <p>photographic examples of how this looks</p>

          <p>on</p>

          <p>Asian skin on Black skin um and so it</p>

          <p>looks different and this might be a</p>

          <p>crucial thing that is being missed</p>

          <p>in a certain section of population and</p>

          <p>we already know that</p>

          <p>outcomes and covid for um particular</p>

          <p>ethnic groups</p>

          <p>is very different um than it is in white</p>

          <p>groups so</p>

          <p>um actually the um the cover tracking</p>

          <p>app that</p>

          <p>um is uh developed by zoe is the one</p>

          <p>that's been used quite a lot in the uk</p>

          <p>at the moment I’m sure</p>

          <p>a lot of people on this call um can</p>

          <p>say they're every day on it</p>

          <p>and they put out a call for people to um</p>

          <p>send in pictures if</p>

          <p>if they had experienced the rash and um</p>

          <p>you know</p>

          <p>uh weren't from um a caucasian</p>

          <p>background</p>

          <p>um and so we could have examples of that</p>

          <p>so</p>

          <p>um so yeah it has kind of real world</p>

          <p>consequences this kind of stuff</p>

          <p>um and what Natasha said as well about</p>

          <p>it applying to kind of other</p>

          <p>characteristics as well so</p>

          <p>for anyone who's read like the Caroline</p>

          <p>Criado-Perez Invisible Women</p>

          <p>there's quite a lot there about how um</p>

          <p>medical research has historically</p>

          <p>erased women from a lot of trials</p>

          <p>um and consequently our understanding</p>

          <p>our medical model of understanding some</p>

          <p>conditions is based on how it presents</p>

          <p>in men for example so</p>

          <p>um so again it's about that kind of real</p>

          <p>world consequence so I think</p>

          <p>for us as um</p>

          <p>as healthcare librarians as information</p>

          <p>professionals we need to</p>

          <p>get ahead of a curve right we need to</p>

          <p>understand where the gaps in our</p>

          <p>knowledge are</p>

          <p>and be conscious of that and think think</p>

          <p>about that bear that in mind when we</p>

          <p>carry out literature searches when we</p>

          <p>think about our collections</p>

          <p>and you know that's on our speed</p>

          <p>that's great thank you we've actually</p>

          <p>had some a really good question</p>

          <p>um um Shakira has uh shared the</p>

          <p>information on the mind the gap book</p>

          <p>that you were talking about from</p>

          <p>Saint George's if you were interested in</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>we can add that link into our resources</p>

          <p>list actually can't we</p>

          <p>yeah lovely thank you that would be</p>

          <p>great so</p>

          <p>um Camilla has asked uh when we do</p>

          <p>literature searches on eg dermatological</p>

          <p>conditions and darker skin</p>

          <p>sometimes it seems that there is very</p>

          <p>little research or no research</p>

          <p>is there an organization or somewhere we</p>

          <p>can report these research gaps to</p>

          <p>somewhere that is able to pass on the</p>

          <p>message that most research is needed on</p>

          <p>x y and z, wow that's, if</p>

          <p>there is a place yes great question we</p>

          <p>we should try and find out I wonder if</p>

          <p>they're in</p>

          <p>yeah I wonder if nihr is a good place</p>

          <p>to report that so that's the national</p>

          <p>institute for health research they're</p>

          <p>the main funding body</p>

          <p>for nhs research and they give out grants</p>

          <p>for research conducted in the nhs</p>

          <p>and I think one of their remits is to</p>

          <p>try and correct like gaps in the</p>

          <p>knowledge</p>

          <p>in the evidence so um that might be one</p>

          <p>that comes to mind but that's definitely</p>

          <p>something we should go away and look at</p>

          <p>and we might add that to the reading</p>

          <p>list</p>

          <p>I’m wondering if if if some of these</p>

          <p>like some more</p>

          <p>say like Runnymede Trust or whatever</p>

          <p>might have some ideas as well</p>

          <p>yeah some other like that it's a think</p>

          <p>tank isn't it so um</p>

          <p>yeah yeah yeah that's a really good</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>with action to take away yeah and they’re</p>

          <p>really well placed to kind of spot that</p>

          <p>kind of thing and report it</p>

          <p>sorry just flicking back and forth</p>

          <p>through the chat and I’m using myself</p>

          <p>there's been another um uh suggestion</p>

          <p>here from Suzanne Wilson she says the</p>

          <p>James Lind alliance</p>

          <p>and she's put the link in which we will</p>

          <p>add to our resources pack thank you</p>

          <p>susanne that's really</p>

          <p>okay should we move on to our next</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>so how can libraries promote their edi</p>

          <p>collections and encourage engagement</p>

          <p>with this topic through the resources</p>

          <p>that they provide</p>

          <p>so this is a great question um</p>

          <p>and I think you know um</p>

          <p>I don't think it's a case of doing</p>

          <p>anything extra</p>

          <p>over and above what you already do in</p>

          <p>your services</p>

          <p>and in the services that you provide</p>

          <p>it's about rethinking all of those</p>

          <p>activities you do</p>

          <p>with a different lens thinking about it</p>

          <p>through the edi</p>

          <p>the edi lens um and so like Natasha's</p>

          <p>already given a great example of this</p>

          <p>in terms of like things about training</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>you know like could you if you host a</p>

          <p>journal club for example</p>

          <p>um could you use that journal club model</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>use it to host discussions around</p>

          <p>diversity where you</p>

          <p>um you could use not only like</p>

          <p>clinical uh like clinical research but</p>

          <p>you could use maybe like um</p>

          <p>a think piece that is about an aspect of</p>

          <p>uh diversity and inclusion that you</p>

          <p>think it's really useful to have a</p>

          <p>conversation about</p>

          <p>um and so you give people that reading</p>

          <p>and then it's up to you you have the</p>

          <p>physical space and you can kind of host</p>

          <p>the space to have that discussion</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>uh one that kind of provides</p>

          <p>lifelong learning continuous learning</p>

          <p>opportunities which is</p>

          <p>you know that's our jam that's what we</p>

          <p>do um</p>

          <p>and it's it's continuing to engage um</p>

          <p>people with your servers who may maybe</p>

          <p>they don't need to use the library</p>

          <p>in their day-to-day job but this is like</p>

          <p>again proving that</p>

          <p>this the service library can be relevant</p>

          <p>to their professional development</p>

          <p>in a different way</p>

          <p>yep yes I really like that um that</p>

          <p>lifelong learning idea and I think that</p>

          <p>some of the questions</p>

          <p>specifically about black history month</p>

          <p>and stuff I think sometimes we sort of</p>

          <p>think oh you know</p>

          <p>Black History Month or five months is it</p>

          <p>really relevant to what we're doing well</p>

          <p>actually</p>

          <p>I think these are things that many of us</p>

          <p>need to learn more about and it will</p>

          <p>benefit us not just in our work but in</p>

          <p>our</p>

          <p>home lives as well so I think it's a</p>

          <p>really good opportunity to</p>

          <p>have those conversations and also you</p>

          <p>know</p>

          <p>it can be fun as well it doesn't have to</p>

          <p>be really serious you know</p>

          <p>the one about activity ideas for Black</p>

          <p>History Month well yeah you could get</p>

          <p>people to read that you could also get</p>

          <p>people to watch a film</p>

          <p>you know a podcast uh that kind of thing</p>

          <p>um and have a</p>

          <p>comedy sketch even and have a discussion</p>

          <p>about it so</p>

          <p>um yeah yeah yeah and that's a great</p>

          <p>point about like yeah it doesn't</p>

          <p>it doesn't have to be po faced so um</p>

          <p>we had pride week at the fund recently</p>

          <p>and one thing we did was</p>

          <p>to host a quiz um but the quiz was an</p>

          <p>educational quiz so</p>

          <p>all the questions were centered around</p>

          <p>um lgbt history</p>

          <p>um so it was educational as well as</p>

          <p>being a social activity</p>

          <p>one of the questions about encouraging</p>

          <p>engagement and encouraging people to</p>

          <p>join in one of the phrases that our</p>

          <p>ethnic minority network</p>

          <p>uses is um remember opening events out</p>

          <p>to everybody</p>

          <p>we did this yesterday um they said we</p>

          <p>would like attendance to reflect the</p>

          <p>makeup</p>

          <p>of the organization so we want sixty</p>

          <p>percent white staff forty percent</p>

          <p>BAME and they pretty much got it</p>

          <p>um pretty much the stats debate they</p>

          <p>were doing a slider on it um</p>

          <p>yeah so I think I think sometimes</p>

          <p>people think things aren't for them so</p>

          <p>you have to and that's something we're</p>

          <p>doing in the recruitment isn't it you</p>

          <p>know making it obvious we want</p>

          <p>applications from underrepresented</p>

          <p>groups</p>

          <p>we're saying for these kind of</p>

          <p>activities as well</p>

          <p>yeah yeah and I think that's that's a</p>

          <p>really good point Natasha is that um</p>

          <p>often like edi stuff can kind of</p>

          <p>attract a certain crowd and it can</p>

          <p>either attract people who</p>

          <p>you know um they're attracted to it</p>

          <p>because it reflects</p>

          <p>their lived experience and so you know</p>

          <p>if they people want to get involved</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>it is really about directly influencing</p>

          <p>change to make</p>

          <p>their own experience of the workplace</p>

          <p>better um</p>

          <p>or it can be people who are kind of um</p>

          <p>you know really allied to the cause and</p>

          <p>quite active and</p>

          <p>um already quite active uh in that space</p>

          <p>um and I think for people who are newer</p>

          <p>to the conversation it can feel</p>

          <p>um it can feel scary to join that</p>

          <p>and when there's there might be a gap in</p>

          <p>where they are on their journey and</p>

          <p>where other people are on their journey</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>you know often people don't want to get</p>

          <p>involved in stuff like this because</p>

          <p>they're scared of saying the wrong thing</p>

          <p>or they're scared that it's not a space</p>

          <p>for them so being really explicit about</p>

          <p>what we expect</p>

          <p>is really important and saying you know</p>

          <p>we expect everyone to get involved in</p>

          <p>this because this is a problem</p>

          <p>not only for um black and brown people to solve</p>

          <p>it's a problem for everyone to solve</p>

          <p>I think that fits in really well to</p>

          <p>another question we have that is on</p>

          <p>the slide around</p>

          <p>um being an ally so somebody had</p>

          <p>recently taken part in ally training</p>

          <p>provided by the trust lgbtq plus network</p>

          <p>and they wondered what your thoughts</p>

          <p>were on staff becoming an ally</p>

          <p>oh that's really um that's really timely</p>

          <p>question because we um the call I was</p>

          <p>talking about just now was brought out of the lgbt+ network and allies</p>

          <p>and um I think it can be</p>

          <p>really powerful um as long as we're</p>

          <p>clear on what the ask is and one of&nbsp;</p>

          <p>the slides we had on the call</p>

          <p>yesterday was</p>

          <p>what an ally is not what you mustn’t do and</p>

          <p>then they were giving and then there was</p>

          <p>another slightly different thing to do</p>

          <p>um and and I’ve heard this from our</p>

          <p>lgbtq</p>

          <p>network um when they launched their</p>

          <p>allies scheme they gave everybody this</p>

          <p>nice little badge</p>

          <p>and they've sort of thrown there a few</p>

          <p>months long it's not just about the</p>

          <p>badge we actually need people to</p>

          <p>do stuff so one good thing on our call</p>

          <p>yesterday if we had all our senior</p>

          <p>integrated care directors</p>

          <p>and our chief executives even making</p>

          <p>pledges about things that they are going</p>

          <p>to do</p>

          <p>to demonstrate that allyship and so</p>

          <p>they're going to be held accountable</p>

          <p>by the network by the organization for</p>

          <p>the things they said on the</p>

          <p>or on the call yesterday um one thing</p>

          <p>we haven't got on the reading list that</p>

          <p>we should add um</p>

          <p>Yvonne Coghill um who was</p>

          <p>with the red team I’m not sure if she</p>

          <p>still is but she's still obviously</p>

          <p>operating this area she just did a seven</p>

          <p>days of allyship</p>

          <p>slide thing that's been going around on</p>

          <p>twitter that was really good it's just</p>

          <p>on one page</p>

          <p>um we should add that to the reading</p>

          <p>list</p>

          <p>yeah actions yeah yeah and I think you</p>

          <p>know</p>

          <p>um I think the key for the key thing for</p>

          <p>me in terms of allyship is that you need</p>

          <p>to be active</p>

          <p>at my ship um allyship to kind of signal</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>you're for the cause is great but we</p>

          <p>need to go one further</p>

          <p>we we need we need white people to step</p>

          <p>up</p>

          <p>and actually help us push this boulder</p>

          <p>up the hill because</p>

          <p>um if it's only people from an ethnic</p>

          <p>minority background pushing that boulder</p>

          <p>up the hill then</p>

          <p>you know if you think about it you're</p>

          <p>perpetuating the same problem it's</p>

          <p>it's unpaid labour it's work on an</p>

          <p>underrepresented group to fix the</p>

          <p>problems that have been</p>

          <p>created by a dominant group so um</p>

          <p>allyship can look like a lot of</p>

          <p>different things yeah it can look like</p>

          <p>personal commitment</p>

          <p>it can look like um</p>

          <p>you know being the person to take on the</p>

          <p>difficult conversation</p>

          <p>so that your colleague from an ethnic</p>

          <p>minority background doesn't have to</p>

          <p>if someone has said something in a</p>

          <p>meeting that you know doesn't sit well</p>

          <p>with you</p>

          <p>maybe maybe that's like a really great</p>

          <p>thing you can do is to kind of</p>

          <p>call that out um so that it's it's less</p>

          <p>of a fraught conversation for the person</p>

          <p>who</p>

          <p>has the least power in that situation um</p>

          <p>yeah so it's just about thinking about</p>

          <p>what you can do</p>

          <p>um one of the questions on the slide</p>

          <p>uh is about you know are they good</p>

          <p>examples of um</p>

          <p>trust implementing training where people</p>

          <p>can feel the lived experiences of stuff</p>

          <p>I say another kind of really important</p>

          <p>thing you can do as an ally is</p>

          <p>to not rely on people</p>

          <p>having to kind of mine some of their</p>

          <p>traumatic experiences so that you can</p>

          <p>learn</p>

          <p>there's a lot out there already um you</p>

          <p>know there are people there are talented</p>

          <p>authors podcasters</p>

          <p>screenwriters actors who have all kind</p>

          <p>of</p>

          <p>um created stuff that help you</p>

          <p>understand what that lived experience is</p>

          <p>like</p>

          <p>um it's a tough ask to ask your</p>

          <p>colleagues</p>

          <p>to share that because it can be risky</p>

          <p>you know like</p>

          <p>if um if you experience the workplace in</p>

          <p>a different way and then you're being</p>

          <p>asked to kind of</p>

          <p>disclose how different that is and how</p>

          <p>bad that is for you</p>

          <p>that's a really tough place to be put in</p>

          <p>um and just to say yeah one thing that</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>I’ve added to the reading list is that</p>

          <p>the King’s Trust have recently</p>

          <p>published a piece of research which</p>

          <p>includes some</p>

          <p>data of that ilk that is anonymized so</p>

          <p>that helps give you a flavour but there</p>

          <p>is</p>

          <p>plenty out there that's written on this</p>

          <p>and specifically in the nhs context as</p>

          <p>well</p>

          <p>just a couple of things out there Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>yeah we shouldn't be asking our</p>

          <p>colleagues to</p>

          <p>to relive their horrible experiences but</p>

          <p>if you're going to pay somebody who does</p>

          <p>this for a living to</p>

          <p>you know facilitate those conversations</p>

          <p>or just um</p>

          <p>uh interpret that for you then there are</p>

          <p>several good people out there who can</p>

          <p>have those conversations</p>

          <p>and and take that um because they're</p>

          <p>paid to do it</p>

          <p>rather than your staff having to do it</p>

          <p>the other one is um</p>

          <p>I just recently came across and it's on</p>

          <p>the reading list um this thing called</p>

          <p>hexitime I don't know if people have</p>

          <p>seen it</p>

          <p>it's uh like a time banking thing and</p>

          <p>they have running a campaign about</p>

          <p>supporting BAME colleagues because</p>

          <p>several of my um several of my white</p>

          <p>mostly male colleagues have signed up</p>

          <p>for that this week</p>

          <p>that offered to do things like interview</p>

          <p>coaching um and mentoring</p>

          <p>for um more junior um</p>

          <p>new qualified allied health</p>

          <p>professionals for example so</p>

          <p>that might be something you think you</p>

          <p>that you could do and I'll also be</p>

          <p>outside your work as well</p>

          <p>you know um actually um I’m so nobody</p>

          <p>can stop you from doing it if you want</p>

          <p>to offer a mentor</p>

          <p>or give interview and practice for</p>

          <p>somebody</p>

          <p>thank you I think um I think you've kind</p>

          <p>of gone into some of these</p>

          <p>examples that this next question has</p>

          <p>asked but um</p>

          <p>Richard has said what does it</p>

          <p>mean to help as an old white middle</p>

          <p>class guy I’m aware</p>

          <p>I don't want to patronize or mansplain</p>

          <p>to people what concrete things can I do</p>

          <p>I think the fact that you know the word</p>

          <p>mansplain means that you're probably</p>

          <p>you're on the right lines there</p>

          <p>I that I always appreciate when my older</p>

          <p>white colleagues do that is um when they</p>

          <p>say my name when I’m not there</p>

          <p>or when they reference work that I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>done when I will bring me into a</p>

          <p>conversation about something I can help</p>

          <p>with</p>

          <p>that there's people you can do that for</p>

          <p>yeah um like I said before you can be</p>

          <p>the person to have a difficult</p>

          <p>conversation too</p>

          <p>so harking back to one of the earlier</p>

          <p>questions about resistance</p>

          <p>if um people are trying to make change</p>

          <p>um about something chances are that um</p>

          <p>as a white</p>

          <p>white man people might listen to you</p>

          <p>more than they do to other people</p>

          <p>um than they do to a woman of colour so</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>you know you're you're you can utilize</p>

          <p>your privilege for good</p>

          <p>thanks that was great okay so</p>

          <p>this is a big topic as well actually it</p>

          <p>came up what should library collections</p>

          <p>relating to</p>

          <p>equality diversity and inclusion or BAME</p>

          <p>groups be called what language would be</p>

          <p>most appropriate and least offensive</p>

          <p>so we've put some stuff on the reading</p>

          <p>list about the different terms haven't</p>

          <p>we Hong-Anh because there's</p>

          <p>there's a lot to unpick with them</p>

          <p>yeah there is um we've actually been</p>

          <p>having this conversation quite a lot</p>

          <p>at fund recently um</p>

          <p>partially I think because we've realized</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>one of the reasons why we what the</p>

          <p>consequence of us</p>

          <p>having historically not done that much</p>

          <p>work about it is that we don't have the</p>

          <p>confidence to talk about it because we</p>

          <p>feel like we don't have the language and</p>

          <p>language is so often a barrier in terms</p>

          <p>of people trying to get involved in this</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>people don't want to offend um</p>

          <p><br />
          so like I think the key thing here is</p>

          <p>that there is</p>

          <p>this is not going to be very helpful but</p>

          <p>there is no right or wrong</p>

          <p>so I’m fine with the term BAME being</p>

          <p>used</p>

          <p>other people aren't I’m okay with it</p>

          <p>being used in certain contexts</p>

          <p>so I think it's I think where you use</p>

          <p>terms you have to use them meaningfully</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>ensure that you've put some thought into</p>

          <p>it so</p>

          <p>BAME is okay if what you mean is</p>

          <p>actually</p>

          <p>Black Asian and Ethnic Minority bame is</p>

          <p>not okay if you are only referring to a</p>

          <p>few of those groups for example</p>

          <p>um I I think</p>

          <p>language is loaded and it just means</p>

          <p>that um</p>

          <p>it means something different to everyone</p>

          <p>else so</p>

          <p>I think as long as you make the decision</p>

          <p>and you've done your research</p>

          <p>research and you're able to say why</p>

          <p>you've made that decision</p>

          <p>that is that is the best approach to</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>so an example is um at the fund we uh</p>

          <p>used</p>

          <p>capital b for Black and we had a</p>

          <p>discussion about what that why that</p>

          <p>is and um because you know Black is not</p>

          <p>it's not an ethnicity but there is um</p>

          <p>a political dimension to it in terms of</p>

          <p>it's</p>

          <p>you know it's a social construct um that</p>

          <p>is recognized so</p>

          <p>it is used with capital b but</p>

          <p>there's also discussion about whether</p>

          <p>you should also capitalise the w</p>

          <p>in white um and the capital w and white</p>

          <p>is sometimes associated with</p>

          <p>white supremacy but then also if you</p>

          <p>don't capitalize it then</p>

          <p>it plays into that whole thing of like</p>

          <p>uh white people not recognizing that</p>

          <p>they are also holders of race</p>

          <p>races not only held by people who aren't</p>

          <p>white</p>

          <p>so it's really complex and messy but</p>

          <p>just do your research and and figure out</p>

          <p>where you fall</p>

          <p>on it and why you've made those</p>

          <p>decisions so that if you get called out</p>

          <p>on it if people want to know why you've</p>

          <p>made that decision you can have a</p>

          <p>meaningful conversation about it</p>

          <p>thank you I don't know Natasha do you</p>

          <p>have anything to add to that</p>

          <p>no I suppose I might just say something</p>

          <p>about um</p>

          <p>a question saying about collections</p>

          <p>related to edI or BAME groups and i</p>

          <p>think I like the idea more of having an</p>

          <p>edi</p>

          <p>collection because you know we're</p>

          <p>thinking about this holistically</p>

          <p>everything about all</p>

          <p>trying to think about all the detective</p>

          <p>characteristics</p>

          <p>and it would be nice to make sure you</p>

          <p>have stuff covering all of those</p>

          <p>different label groups as well and i</p>

          <p>don't know maybe it depends on how big</p>

          <p>your collection is maybe</p>

          <p>I don't think i'd have enough to have</p>

          <p>separate reading this drawer</p>

          <p>okay so maybe you've gone</p>

          <p>I think that's a really good point as</p>

          <p>well because it takes into that idea of</p>

          <p>intersectionality as well so you know</p>

          <p>we should be thinking about all the</p>

          <p>characteristics and all these different</p>

          <p>characteristics don't sit in silos</p>

          <p>um you know so um it's really important</p>

          <p>to yeah</p>

          <p>think about it holistically</p>

          <p>fab right we have some chats going on</p>

          <p>um and some of these relate a bit back</p>

          <p>to some of the previous questions so i'm</p>

          <p>just going to go through them</p>

          <p>um as they've cropped up okay</p>

          <p>so William has asked would you like</p>

          <p>diversity engagement</p>

          <p>assessed by health education for example</p>

          <p>as part of the quality</p>

          <p>impact outcome framework assessment</p>

          <p>do we are we thinking about equality and</p>

          <p>diversity of library knowledge services</p>

          <p>as part of the new</p>

          <p>is that what we're saying I think so</p>

          <p>yeah</p>

          <p>being specified whether it's workforce</p>

          <p>or library</p>

          <p>services stuff but um I suppose either</p>

          <p>or both</p>

          <p>well I think we we are in the refresh of</p>

          <p>the knowledge for healthcare</p>

          <p>you've got diversity is much more</p>

          <p>explicit in there</p>

          <p>in the um driver diagrams and things</p>

          <p>um i</p>

          <p>oh I’m not sure I’m not sure I have a</p>

          <p>library with my library manager hat on i</p>

          <p>think the quality improvement outcomes</p>

          <p>is</p>

          <p>big enough and the other thing is like</p>

          <p>Hong-Anh talks saying you know we</p>

          <p>shouldn't be doing any new stuff</p>

          <p>this stuff should become mainstream and</p>

          <p>should be part of um you know</p>

          <p>the way that we make sure that our</p>

          <p>collections are are comprehensive and</p>

          <p>addressing all the relevant issues for</p>

          <p>our</p>

          <p>organizations yeah</p>

          <p>no I don't think so I I think it</p>

          <p>depends</p>

          <p>so I I think I think it depends on</p>

          <p>how we want to encourage libraries to</p>

          <p>pay attention to this</p>

          <p>so one way to do it is through that</p>

          <p>means I don't work in an nhs library so</p>

          <p>I have no idea of</p>

          <p>um what it means to kind of do the the</p>

          <p>quality framework assessment</p>

          <p>and what that might add if we we add</p>

          <p>that in it but</p>

          <p>I think there are other ways to try and</p>

          <p>encourage</p>

          <p>um people like libraries to pay</p>

          <p>attention to edi</p>

          <p>in their services it doesn't just have</p>

          <p>to be through this</p>

          <p>and if we if it was included it</p>

          <p>shouldn't be only through that either</p>

          <p>yeah I I think I agree with you and I</p>

          <p>attended some training yesterday</p>

          <p>actually on um the legalities of</p>

          <p>equality diversity and human rights and</p>

          <p>and they made a really interesting</p>

          <p>point that we can be using our equality</p>

          <p>impact assessments</p>

          <p>on um things like developing new</p>

          <p>teaching programs</p>

          <p>to ensure that we're checking that</p>

          <p>everything is inclusive</p>

          <p>we've explored all options when we're</p>

          <p>doing those things so that might be</p>

          <p>something to think about</p>

          <p>for us as well</p>

          <p>okay back to the chat there's lots of</p>

          <p>things going on</p>

          <p>um so Shakira has said how to navigate</p>

          <p>these conversations with colleagues</p>

          <p>as a black woman I almost anticipate</p>

          <p>ignorant comments and don't feel it is</p>

          <p>my duty to emotionally drain myself</p>

          <p>should just I be more involved um</p>

          <p>no I think you need to be the priority I</p>

          <p>think is you need to look after yourself</p>

          <p>if you don't feel you can do it in the</p>

          <p>moment or ever then then I don't think</p>

          <p>it's for you to take it on</p>

          <p>I I don't think um I</p>

          <p>I’m talking to some older colleagues</p>

          <p>the group I I was having a</p>

          <p>conversation with the</p>

          <p>I don't think she's on the call today</p>

          <p>but she was sort of saying you know we</p>

          <p>were doing this work 20 years ago</p>

          <p>in libraries then it kind of dropped off</p>

          <p>and I come back and she's like I just</p>

          <p>want to get on with my job</p>

          <p>um and so I think it's for those who</p>

          <p>have the energy right now me and hang</p>

          <p>out and got a bit of energy right now</p>

          <p>to do this work and then you know maybe</p>

          <p>we'll step back and some other people</p>

          <p>will take it up in a couple of years um</p>

          <p>I'm</p>

          <p>sorry you have to anticipate those</p>

          <p>comments and it's just it's just</p>

          <p>draining because</p>

          <p>I think speaking for myself I don't want</p>

          <p>to be talking about this I just like to</p>

          <p>get on with my life</p>

          <p>and just be me but</p>

          <p>you know we can't get away from it and</p>

          <p>uh yeah</p>

          <p>yeah I would totally agree it's</p>

          <p>yeah you need to make the best decision</p>

          <p>for you</p>

          <p>and um if you if you don't want to</p>

          <p>engage in those conversations</p>

          <p>don't it's if if the emotional burden of</p>

          <p>it is too much</p>

          <p>if it takes away from you progressing in</p>

          <p>your career</p>

          <p>using time for your own career</p>

          <p>progression for other things in your</p>

          <p>life that are valuable</p>

          <p>no don't do it um you know like I think</p>

          <p>I I saw a tweet the other day which was</p>

          <p>about kind of um</p>

          <p>imagine all like the great black writers</p>

          <p>if if they if racism</p>

          <p>didn't exist</p>

          <p>what would their work be about but as it</p>

          <p>is they had to devote their intellectual</p>

          <p>energy</p>

          <p>to writing about this stuff you do not</p>

          <p>have to devote your energy to that</p>

          <p>um if you want to then that's great but</p>

          <p>as we've said before the push is not for</p>

          <p>um it's for everyone to pick up this</p>

          <p>baton</p>

          <p>um and no one can do this work</p>

          <p>indefinitely</p>

          <p>and yeah I like Natasha like this is not</p>

          <p>this is not necessarily what I want to</p>

          <p>be spending my time on but</p>

          <p>here we are</p>

          <p>[Laughter]</p>

          <p>um what I will say is that</p>

          <p>uh it's not like I don't get anything</p>

          <p>from this work so it's been really</p>

          <p>developmental for me being involved in</p>

          <p>this work it's really helped me to build</p>

          <p>um skills and stuff that maybe i</p>

          <p>wouldn't have gotten the chance to</p>

          <p>at this point in my career in a library</p>

          <p>role</p>

          <p>so my ability to kind of</p>

          <p>um influence upwards has really been</p>

          <p>honed</p>

          <p>by um being involved in edI work um in</p>

          <p>thinking kind of really strategically</p>

          <p>for example I probably wouldn't be able</p>

          <p>to do that unless I’ve got</p>

          <p>up to the next rung of the ladder in my</p>

          <p>career so</p>

          <p>there are benefits but it's up to you to</p>

          <p>decide</p>

          <p>what the trade-off is between like your</p>

          <p>emotional</p>

          <p>mental health because it is draining and</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>whether you want to kind of progress</p>

          <p>your career in that way and through this</p>

          <p>channel</p>

          <p>yeah so i'll just come in again they're</p>

          <p>hanging just to echo about what you're</p>

          <p>saying the work what I'm</p>

          <p>starting to do now with the ethnic</p>

          <p>minority network being a strategic</p>

          <p>ambassador means you know I’m in contact</p>

          <p>with all these much senior</p>

          <p>members of staff one there that keeps</p>

          <p>from and really enjoying getting to know</p>

          <p>them as well</p>

          <p>and the other thing we're talking about</p>

          <p>careers is that it's only in the last</p>

          <p>couple of years I’ve started talking</p>

          <p>about these issues and that's because</p>

          <p>I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>been around for a long time now um I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>been at that stage in my career where i</p>

          <p>feel comfortable having a talk about</p>

          <p>these issues</p>

          <p>when I was first qualified in my first</p>

          <p>job I wouldn't</p>

          <p>have wanted to go there and I it might</p>

          <p>have been unwise to have gone there</p>

          <p>whereas now I’m not that I’m untouchable</p>

          <p>but it's just a bit more</p>

          <p>it's just a perhaps a bit more with age</p>

          <p>as well at ease with myself I guess</p>

          <p>um the other thing I was saying you're</p>

          <p>saying about what you get out of it</p>

          <p>um I’ve told you to Hong-Anh before is</p>

          <p>that I do feel</p>

          <p>when I do this work it's one of the ways</p>

          <p>I like that I honour the ancestors</p>

          <p>and really just be thankful for the fact</p>

          <p>that you know</p>

          <p>people who went through hideous time you</p>

          <p>know I’m here and I'm</p>

          <p>able to feel bits to try and make things</p>

          <p>better for those who are coming after us</p>

          <p>I do get something out of it yeah</p>

          <p>thank you thank you Shakira for the</p>

          <p>question I think that's really powerful</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>certainly personally that makes me feel</p>

          <p>like I should be paying more attention</p>

          <p>to pick up when those things are</p>

          <p>happening so I can step in for my</p>

          <p>colleagues</p>

          <p>and that's definitely on my action list</p>

          <p>from now on</p>

          <p>and Shakira has said thank you as well</p>

          <p>she says thanks for your responses I'm</p>

          <p>sure many um people of colour in</p>

          <p>libraries are outnumbered so it can be</p>

          <p>a daunting task absolutely yeah</p>

          <p>yeah okay um just</p>

          <p>quickly we've had some great uh links</p>

          <p>from -- on</p>

          <p>um writing styles so we will link those</p>

          <p>as well</p>

          <p>because it says we're absolutely</p>

          <p>committed in knowledge for healthcare to</p>

          <p>build growth and develop a diverse and</p>

          <p>inclusive library knowledge services</p>

          <p>workforce</p>

          <p>um but then William does mention and</p>

          <p>this is absolutely true</p>

          <p>I guess diversity isn't once in the</p>

          <p>quality impact outcome framework so</p>

          <p>perhaps even if it isn't assessed it</p>

          <p>should be mentioned</p>

          <p>I think that's a really important point</p>

          <p>I will take back to my colleagues thank</p>

          <p>you William</p>

          <p>um so</p>

          <p>what we're going to do now is I’m going</p>

          <p>to unmute you</p>

          <p>all so if you can just muted</p>

          <p>yourself so we're not</p>

          <p>suddenly inundated with background</p>

          <p>information and then you can ask</p>

          <p>questions if you want to using the hand</p>

          <p>up function</p>

          <p>okay here we go</p>

          <p>you can just mute yourself please</p>

          <p>anybody want to ask a question please</p>

          <p>put your hands up</p>

          <p>I don't see any hands coming up just yet</p>

          <p>you can also still use the chat if you</p>

          <p>want to to ask questions</p>

          <p>or make comments about the things that</p>

          <p>we've been discussing today</p>

          <p>otherwise let me just scroll down a</p>

          <p>little I’ve got</p>

          <p>hand, Bertha I’m just going to come to</p>

          <p>you I’m going to unmute you</p>

          <p>so please ask your question hi uh well</p>

          <p>rather instead of</p>

          <p>a question I just wanted to share things</p>

          <p>that we have been doing here at</p>

          <p>MSC at Southend</p>

          <p>so um I started this job in February</p>

          <p>2019</p>

          <p>and when I first started one of the</p>

          <p>first things was to get involved with</p>

          <p>different groups</p>

          <p>just to attend to the meetings um i</p>

          <p>attended to the faith group</p>

          <p>and I attended to the BAME group so when</p>

          <p>I attended to the BAME group i</p>

          <p>found out that there was so much work</p>

          <p>that we could contribute</p>

          <p>and from then um we started this</p>

          <p>diversity collection</p>

          <p>here and more recently we started this</p>

          <p>inclusion and diversity bulletin</p>

          <p>which has been well received so I think</p>

          <p>for me</p>

          <p>just sharing my experience is um we need</p>

          <p>to be curious</p>

          <p>what what's going on what's around there</p>

          <p>um you know as librarians we think of</p>

          <p>doctors and nurses but there is</p>

          <p>managers their managers their uh</p>

          <p>porters there is so much going on and we</p>

          <p>are not curious to find out what are</p>

          <p>their life and how we can serve them</p>

          <p>then if it's all all these things going</p>

          <p>uh hanging around</p>

          <p>so I don't feel myself &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I</p>

          <p>am um I am not BAME</p>

          <p>but if you see my face and if you hear</p>

          <p>my</p>

          <p>voice then you know that I’m not a white</p>

          <p>british</p>

          <p>but where I come from I’m a white</p>

          <p>privileged person I’m from mexico</p>

          <p>and in that context is how I learn about</p>

          <p>my privilege</p>

          <p>and I still hold this privilege here</p>

          <p>because at some point I just shut down</p>

          <p>but I noticed that if I shut down then i</p>

          <p>don't learn</p>

          <p>and yeah so this is what I wanted to</p>

          <p>share with you</p>

          <p>that's wonderful thank you and I think</p>

          <p>your point about curiosity is so</p>

          <p>important</p>

          <p>um it's a really important trait</p>

          <p>for our profession in general but yeah</p>

          <p>especially for this</p>

          <p>it's about being curious about how other</p>

          <p>people's lives</p>

          <p>are different from yours other people</p>

          <p>have different viewpoints obviously with</p>

          <p>different experiences</p>

          <p>um they're not all necessarily bad but</p>

          <p>they are different</p>

          <p>um and just having that understanding um</p>

          <p>to broaden your worldview is so</p>

          <p>important for this</p>

          <p>yeah thanks Bertha I did actually mean I</p>

          <p>don't know if we did put it on the</p>

          <p>reading list we were going to flag up</p>

          <p>your</p>

          <p>um bulletin if that's okay um but that's</p>

          <p>a result that people might want to</p>

          <p>read for themselves or to um uh forward</p>

          <p>just to subscribe and forward to other</p>

          <p>colleagues in their organization and</p>

          <p>that will do once more share things</p>

          <p>thank you okay I’ve got a question this</p>

          <p>is a good question from the chat</p>

          <p>and from an anonymous person our manager</p>

          <p>is very concerned about us doing</p>

          <p>anything which seems</p>

          <p>political um do you have any suggestions</p>

          <p>for helping to affirm that this is not</p>

          <p>politics but essential work for the</p>

          <p>library</p>

          <p>oh tricky because I think it is</p>

          <p>political isn't it I think the nh</p>

          <p>the nhs is inherently political</p>

          <p>unfortunately</p>

          <p>uh that's not helpful though for the</p>

          <p>question and</p>

          <p>can we bring it back to thinking about</p>

          <p>like we said earlier on about the health</p>

          <p>inequalities about the social</p>

          <p>determinants that kind of</p>

          <p>aspect um how it ties into prevention</p>

          <p>and these kind of things I mean I think</p>

          <p>yeah</p>

          <p>libraries aren't neutral and I think you</p>

          <p>know if you don't</p>

          <p>you don't take a stance you know you're</p>

          <p>on the side of the oppressors</p>

          <p>you know you you I think people should</p>

          <p>be taking a start with pro</p>

          <p>pro equality um and pro-social justice</p>

          <p>and I</p>

          <p>appreciate that it's hard to articulate</p>

          <p>managers</p>

          <p>yeah so um I think it depends on how</p>

          <p>comfortable you feel with having</p>

          <p>a one-to-one conversation with this</p>

          <p>manager but um</p>

          <p>I don't think they mean political I</p>

          <p>think that's a coded word</p>

          <p>I think that what I’m really saying is i</p>

          <p>don't really feel comfortable with this</p>

          <p>or I don't really get what this is about</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>one of the most important things in this</p>

          <p>work is to utilize your personal</p>

          <p>relationships</p>

          <p>because um you know</p>

          <p>there is so much fear and uncertainty</p>

          <p>that people hold around this work</p>

          <p>so actually using your personal</p>

          <p>relationship having those one-to-one</p>

          <p>chats</p>

          <p>they can become a really safe space to</p>

          <p>help people to understand</p>

          <p>um things that maybe they don't have</p>

          <p>space to talk about</p>

          <p>elsewhere so yeah I think if you can</p>

          <p>feel comfortable to have that</p>

          <p>conversation and</p>

          <p>say to them you know what do you mean by</p>

          <p>political um</p>

          <p>why is that necessarily bad why is it</p>

          <p>out of our remit</p>

          <p>this is the way I see it see what</p>

          <p>happens out of that conversation</p>

          <p>because yeah I I don't think they mean political</p>

          <p>[Laughter]</p>

          <p>thank you that is that is tough um</p>

          <p>and it's something and I think um</p>

          <p>you just have to keep talking about it</p>

          <p>yeah yeah um so Bertha said we can</p>

          <p>share the bulletin which is great we</p>

          <p>will definitely do that</p>

          <p>I’m going to come to Trisha now and just</p>

          <p>unmute you because she's got her hand up</p>

          <p>um let me just do some scrolling</p>

          <p>so Trisha</p>

          <p>holly my doorbell's going I’m sorry i'll</p>

          <p>be back in a sec</p>

          <p>no worries um</p>

          <p>I’m just uh wondering</p>

          <p>how far we should be also including</p>

          <p>other people the underserved</p>

          <p>so there are white</p>

          <p>sections of society who are</p>

          <p>discriminated against because of where</p>

          <p>they live</p>

          <p>or how they speak and also</p>

          <p>I just make the point we need to be</p>

          <p>quite careful about the language we use</p>

          <p>you know people still use um</p>

          <p>quite a lot of</p>

          <p>unacceptable language say like</p>

          <p>chav or something like that and</p>

          <p>people use it</p>

          <p>without even thinking about it and I was</p>

          <p>just having a discussion with somebody</p>

          <p>today at work about</p>

          <p>this aspect of it</p>

          <p>yeah yeah I think that's a really good</p>

          <p>point uh I'll just recap for</p>

          <p>Natasha who's just come back as Tricia</p>

          <p>had a point about you know thinking</p>

          <p>about um</p>

          <p>other underrepresented groups so</p>

          <p>thinking about kind of um</p>

          <p>you know uh groups that socioeconomic</p>

          <p>disadvantage for example</p>

          <p>um yeah um I I think this is why</p>

          <p>it's important to take an intersectional</p>

          <p>approach to this this is</p>

          <p>there's an order of uh lord quote that i</p>

          <p>love which is um</p>

          <p>around you know um we don't live</p>

          <p>single issue lives um and</p>

          <p>intersectionality is about that you know</p>

          <p>um if we take up the cause of race</p>

          <p>equality then we're also taking up the</p>

          <p>cause</p>

          <p>of um of lgbt equality too of gender</p>

          <p>equality of um</p>

          <p>classism um ableism you know all those</p>

          <p>things are intertwined</p>

          <p>all oppression is connected so um</p>

          <p>our approach to that should also be</p>

          <p>connected to holistic so yeah absolutely</p>

          <p>that's</p>

          <p>that's uh that's essential for us to</p>

          <p>think about as well</p>

          <p>but also all fashion is connected but</p>

          <p>they're all</p>

          <p>also distinct that they all need</p>

          <p>slightly different approaches to</p>

          <p>everyone experiences slightly different</p>

          <p>challenges as well</p>

          <p>thank you got a few more things coming</p>

          <p>up on the chat</p>

          <p>um so uh in related to</p>

          <p>the um the previous question about</p>

          <p>um managers who think this is too</p>

          <p>political</p>

          <p>um Helen has said uh that her trust is</p>

          <p>very anxious to take this on and at</p>

          <p>every meeting and at every level we're</p>

          <p>being asked to</p>

          <p>consider Black Lives Matter I think it's</p>

          <p>less politically risky than it used to</p>

          <p>be</p>

          <p>so maybe it goes back to that point you</p>

          <p>mentioned uh right at the beginning Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>about or was it Natasha sorry about</p>

          <p>finding case studies from other</p>

          <p>organizations of what they're doing and</p>

          <p>why it's been so um</p>

          <p>uh good for their service</p>

          <p>yeah you don't have to reinvent the</p>

          <p>wheel there's</p>

          <p>lots of great practice going on out</p>

          <p>there</p>

          <p>and and uh um a a suggestion rather than</p>

          <p>a uh question um</p>

          <p>saying she's currently reading an</p>

          <p>excellent book she's learned a lot and</p>

          <p>she's only a few chapters in called why</p>

          <p>I’m not talking to white people about</p>

          <p>race by Reni Eddo-Lodge</p>

          <p>which I think is on</p>

          <p>your reading list is it not I believe</p>

          <p>it's on the reading list yeah</p>

          <p>yeah it is yeah we've got uh we've got</p>

          <p>that on our reading list and also a</p>

          <p>couple of others as well which</p>

          <p>are kind of if if you're interested in</p>

          <p>kind of continuing your reading journey</p>

          <p>around that</p>

          <p>and there's more stuff like that on</p>

          <p>there</p>

          <p>okay I can't see any more hands up</p>

          <p>apologies if I’ve missed you um and it</p>

          <p>is three o'clock now</p>

          <p>and there aren't any more questions on</p>

          <p>the chat</p>

          <p>so I think we will wrap this up if</p>

          <p>that's okay unless either of you want</p>

          <p>any more um comments before we go</p>

          <p>no I just thank everyone for joining in</p>

          <p>and engaging with us on this it's um</p>

          <p>piece um</p>

          <p>where we will talk about uh how health</p>

          <p>libraries should</p>

          <p>respond to other people perhaps within</p>

          <p>the protected characteristics so</p>

          <p>that would be interesting we'd be really</p>

          <p>interested to hear from you</p>

          <p>um and we will be publishing this</p>

          <p>webinar as a recording</p>

          <p>and its transcript our list of resources</p>

          <p>next few weeks so please keep an eye out</p>

          <p>appreciate is if when you receive your</p>

          <p>evaluation form please fill it in</p>

          <p>there'll be a section there for you to</p>

          <p>some actions to take away from today</p>

          <p>about the things that we can do going</p>

          <p>forward</p>

          <p>I'm going to allow um Natasha and Hong-Anh to introduce themselves um so that they can tell us about the work</p>

          <p>that they do and</p>

          <p>why they're involved in this um</p>

          <p>conversation</p>

          <p>okay um would you like me to go first</p>

          <p>holly</p>

          <p>please do it yeah okay so hI everyone so</p>

          <p>I’m Natasha Howard</p>

          <p>I’m library and knowledge services</p>

          <p>manager at NELFT north east london</p>

          <p>electric foundation trust</p>

          <p>um now I know many of you don't know me</p>

          <p>um some of you are dialing in so you</p>

          <p>can't see me</p>

          <p>I’m not black I’m mixed race or biracial</p>

          <p>so I’m roughly half</p>

          <p>black Afro Caribbean and half white</p>

          <p>english</p>

          <p>my mum was born in Jamaica and in the</p>

          <p>70s the government paid for her to come</p>

          <p>over here to change to be a nurse</p>

          <p>she did her training in Bath and then</p>

          <p>she went to Essex and did whisper training</p>

          <p>and that's where she met my dad so I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>always thought of myself as being half</p>

          <p>Essex half Jamaican</p>

          <p>I’m descended from enslaved people and</p>

          <p>to their enslavers</p>

          <p>but I’m not a spokesperson for black</p>

          <p>people that monolithic group that seems</p>

          <p>to exist in</p>

          <p>your imagination I want to be upfront</p>

          <p>about this because</p>

          <p>we all need to be able to acknowledge</p>

          <p>the privileges that we have</p>

          <p>and um I need to acknowledge the</p>

          <p>privilege the advantage that comes from</p>

          <p>having</p>

          <p>this lighter skin what some people call</p>

          <p>proximity to whiteness</p>

          <p>and it doesn't end there my other great</p>

          <p>privileges include a comfortable</p>

          <p>upbringing</p>

          <p>and fantastic education and we still</p>

          <p>have grammar schools in Essex and i</p>

          <p>passed my 11 plus I went to grammar</p>

          <p>school</p>

          <p>and then I went to King's College London</p>

          <p>now partly because of where I grew up</p>

          <p>and partly because I’m fortunate to have</p>

          <p>a wonderful extended uh family who are</p>

          <p>very loving I’ve never experienced the</p>

          <p>kind of overt</p>

          <p>violent um aggressive racism that many</p>

          <p>people would think of as being proper</p>

          <p>racist</p>

          <p>I’ve always known I was a target as a</p>

          <p>child my dad told me to be careful when</p>

          <p>we were in shops</p>

          <p>keep my hands visible because people</p>

          <p>would think I was going to shoplift</p>

          <p>because I’m brown</p>

          <p>even now if I go into a shop I always</p>

          <p>get a basket if I can't get a basket i</p>

          <p>walk around like this</p>

          <p>like I’m waiting on tables in my hands</p>

          <p>and I just don't even think about</p>

          <p>it when I was six my mom told me i'd</p>

          <p>have to work twice as hard as everyone</p>

          <p>else to get anywhere</p>

          <p>because of the colour of my skin at the</p>

          <p>time I really wasn't that bothered</p>

          <p>because I knew I was a hard worker</p>

          <p>and I was very bright so I just got on</p>

          <p>with it</p>

          <p>and for a long time I naively believed</p>

          <p>that we lived in a meritocracy and that</p>

          <p>part of hard work would pay off</p>

          <p>that our society was post-racial</p>

          <p>perhaps there was some pockets of</p>

          <p>ignorance</p>

          <p>that they are very isolated life started</p>

          <p>to change when my son was born six years</p>

          <p>ago</p>

          <p>he was two weeks early and we were kept</p>

          <p>on the postnatal ward so he could have</p>

          <p>iv antibiotics twice a day</p>

          <p>after we've been there for a few days i</p>

          <p>knew something wasn't right and I kept</p>

          <p>asking the right to midwives if he was</p>

          <p>okay</p>

          <p>they said he was fine his nappies were</p>

          <p>weird and</p>

          <p>they said they were normal it was only</p>

          <p>when it came to a weekend night shift</p>

          <p>and an Indian nurse was starting the</p>

          <p>neonatal unit and doing his iv</p>

          <p>antibiotics and she said to me</p>

          <p>your baby's a little bit jaundiced I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>taken a sample to check</p>

          <p>and a few hours later everything kicked</p>

          <p>off because the results showed that his</p>

          <p>he was really really jaundiced really</p>

          <p>dehydrated in a bad way</p>

          <p>but he was whisked off to the neonatal</p>

          <p>unit and it was nearly two weeks before</p>

          <p>I could take him home</p>

          <p>I was six years ago and he's fine now</p>

          <p>but that's just one example of how</p>

          <p>racism and health care affected outcomes</p>

          <p>the concerns of this very articulate</p>

          <p>educated women were repeatedly ignored</p>

          <p>and the white staff didn't know how to</p>

          <p>support children for non-white babies</p>

          <p>I guess I started to wake up to reality</p>

          <p>I started doing more reading so i</p>

          <p>realized that I had this duty to</p>

          <p>leverage my privilege to facilitate</p>

          <p>change</p>

          <p>but I have engaged with my trust's</p>

          <p>long-standing ethnic minority network</p>

          <p>and I’m now a interview colour rep for</p>

          <p>the network and also strategic</p>

          <p>ambassador</p>

          <p>like we know librarianship is &nbsp;white</p>

          <p>until our profession reflects the</p>

          <p>communities we serve we're not going to</p>

          <p>be equipped to meet their needs</p>

          <p>it's going to take a while to change</p>

          <p>those figures but I think in the</p>

          <p>meantime we all have a duty to</p>

          <p>participate ourselves on EDI</p>

          <p>issues in the broadest sense and how</p>

          <p>they manifest in our work</p>

          <p>and then we can start to act so thanks</p>

          <p>for taking the time to engage with us on</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>thanks Natasha um Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>are you there hold on</p>

          <p>she seems to have disappeared</p>

          <p>oh there you are ah sorry</p>

          <p>um I’m Hong-Anh Nguyen I am the library</p>

          <p>service manager at the kings fund</p>

          <p>so um I guess I work in a health library</p>

          <p>but</p>

          <p>probably not in uh the kind of way that</p>

          <p>most people think about health libraries</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>our collection is focused on health</p>

          <p>and social care policy and management</p>

          <p>and so um like Natasha said and so eloquently said</p>

          <p>um I think one of the things that is</p>

          <p>really important for</p>

          <p>me to clock in my introduction is that</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>this session is about black lives</p>

          <p>matter and</p>

          <p>as you can see I’m not black I am i</p>

          <p>would identify as a woman of colour</p>

          <p>person of colour BAME all of those are</p>

          <p>like words that I might use to describe</p>

          <p>myself just depending on</p>

          <p>the context or southeast Asian or</p>

          <p>Vietnamese</p>

          <p>um and the</p>

          <p>kind of experiences of</p>

          <p>discrimination or othering that I</p>

          <p>experienced</p>

          <p>are very different to the experiences</p>

          <p>of um Black or Asian</p>

          <p>or other ethnic minority people um</p>

          <p>I think it's just really important to</p>

          <p>kind of highlight</p>

          <p>that because um I think what black lives</p>

          <p>matter is really highlighted is that</p>

          <p>BAME isn't like a monolith</p>

          <p>it's an umbrella term that kind of</p>

          <p>covers a lot of experiences</p>

          <p>and for me how that showed up in my life</p>

          <p>is that um</p>

          <p>the southeast Asian community tends to</p>

          <p>be kind of part of what</p>

          <p>we call in this country like the model</p>

          <p>model minority</p>

          <p>um you might have also heard it referred</p>

          <p>to as like the good immigrant</p>

          <p>um as there is this kind of ex</p>

          <p>it kind of shows up as like an</p>

          <p>expectation that uh</p>

          <p>you're going to kind of be very perform</p>

          <p>really</p>

          <p>well academically that you will go into</p>

          <p>certain</p>

          <p>professions so like being a doctor or</p>

          <p>being a pharmacist</p>

          <p>or being a lawyer um</p>

          <p>and I think it's it's about uh</p>

          <p>kind of putting that identity in a box</p>

          <p>and making expectations</p>

          <p>of how they perform but when</p>

          <p>Black Lives Matter um when it kind of</p>

          <p>came to the attention of the world again</p>

          <p>over the past few weeks one of the</p>

          <p>things that really</p>

          <p>that I really kind of thought that was</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>the way that model minorities are used</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>as a tool of white supremacy like as a</p>

          <p>way</p>

          <p>to kind of um</p>

          <p>yes as a way to kind of oppress like</p>

          <p>other</p>

          <p>minority groups um so</p>

          <p>again there is like layers of privilege</p>

          <p>there that we have to think about</p>

          <p>um I guess the other thing I want to say</p>

          <p>is that my experience</p>

          <p>of talking and thinking and doing stuff</p>

          <p>around</p>

          <p>equality diversity and inclusion it's</p>

          <p>it's informed by my lived experience but</p>

          <p>it's really garnered from my</p>

          <p>professional experience so I’m involved</p>

          <p>in a lot of</p>

          <p>the king's funds uh diversity inclusion</p>

          <p>program</p>

          <p>and so I co-lead on a lot of the work</p>

          <p>that we do</p>

          <p>and I’m involved in lots of the</p>

          <p>initiatives so I’m part of the reverse</p>

          <p>mentoring program</p>

          <p>and uh I we introduced um</p>

          <p>a a positive action graduate trainee</p>

          <p>post</p>

          <p>for example so yes so um</p>

          <p>I guess I guess my disclaimer as it were</p>

          <p>would be that</p>

          <p>um and I’m sure Natasha would agree with</p>

          <p>this is</p>

          <p>that while we have experience in this</p>

          <p>field uh we don't have all the answers</p>

          <p>um there is no silver bullet for solving</p>

          <p>the issues that we're going to be</p>

          <p>talking about because if there were</p>

          <p>we wouldn't be having this discussion</p>

          <p>today so I think it's more to say that</p>

          <p>we're just sharing our experiences of</p>

          <p>how</p>

          <p>our journey has been so far in working</p>

          <p>in this area</p>

          <p>thank you that's great so um</p>

          <p>what we've done is we've taken the</p>

          <p>questions that you all are</p>

          <p>on slido and we've sort of grouped them</p>

          <p>together thematically because there were</p>

          <p>quite a lot</p>

          <p>of questions that um went together</p>

          <p>nicely so I’m going to ask Natasha and</p>

          <p>Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>these questions and then they're going</p>

          <p>to have a discussion and during that</p>

          <p>discussion if you want to make any</p>

          <p>further questions or comments please use</p>

          <p>the chat function</p>

          <p>so let's kick off with our first</p>

          <p>question how can library staff</p>

          <p>regardless of level or role</p>

          <p>affect positive change and influence</p>

          <p>upwards where resistance is being met</p>

          <p>tricky isn't it, this is a really good</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>and I’m sure one that both of us really</p>

          <p>relate to in our experience so far</p>

          <p>um I guess so I I guess</p>

          <p>resistance is often felt</p>

          <p>um downwards but resistance can be found</p>

          <p>in like</p>

          <p>all directions within an organization so</p>

          <p>it can be felt from your peers</p>

          <p>it can be felt from your managers from</p>

          <p>directors senior managers um</p>

          <p>so what I always think is that everyone</p>

          <p>is responsible for something right you</p>

          <p>you all have a job description you're</p>

          <p>all responsible for</p>

          <p>delivering an element or aspect of your</p>

          <p>service making certain decisions about</p>

          <p>your service</p>

          <p>that is power um so you have the power</p>

          <p>to make decisions</p>

          <p>that ultimately add up into</p>

          <p>change um if everyone kind of thinks</p>

          <p>about their power consciously so</p>

          <p>if if you're a cataloguer for example</p>

          <p>you might have the ability to kind of</p>

          <p>lead a discussion and lead a piece of</p>

          <p>thinking about</p>

          <p>do the class do the indexing terms we</p>

          <p>use reflect</p>

          <p>really um the languages used nowadays</p>

          <p>um around gender identity</p>

          <p>around race um</p>

          <p>you know that's that's one thing that</p>

          <p>you can do you can't do everything</p>

          <p>but the things that you can do are</p>

          <p>change</p>

          <p>um so that would be my first thought on</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>Natasha what do you think</p>

          <p>yeah I think some different examples</p>

          <p>I’ve seen of training sessions as well</p>

          <p>if you're helping people learn to search</p>

          <p>databases you can use examples that</p>

          <p>speak to</p>

          <p>different aspects whether they're things</p>

          <p>to do with race</p>

          <p>or things to do with issues like um</p>

          <p>domestic violence and that kind of thing</p>

          <p>and so just even from including those</p>

          <p>examples when you're saying</p>

          <p>people it's just starting to broaden out</p>

          <p>the thinking a little bit more</p>

          <p>um the other one</p>

          <p>um I was thinking of is about sharing</p>

          <p>good practice from elsewhere</p>

          <p>like maybe your boss doesn't want to do</p>

          <p>it but there's nothing to stop you</p>

          <p>talking about</p>

          <p>what everyone else is doing or what</p>

          <p>someone else is doing</p>

          <p>and you know if it gets talked about</p>

          <p>enough um</p>

          <p>there will be um there will be that</p>

          <p>pressure to do something</p>

          <p>yeah and also I mean particularly for</p>

          <p>the nhs</p>

          <p>there's an aspect of um accountability</p>

          <p>as well so</p>

          <p>you know you've got the workforce race</p>

          <p>equality standard</p>

          <p>um which which are the measures that um</p>

          <p>that you know are applied nationally</p>

          <p>across the service in terms of measuring</p>

          <p>uh race disparity in the nhs and</p>

          <p>um that's not so there are kind of</p>

          <p>things that the nhs is required to do</p>

          <p>standards that they require to meet</p>

          <p>and so is there any way that you can</p>

          <p>kind of train your argument</p>

          <p>in terms of like this link to a</p>

          <p>strategic priority</p>

          <p>it might lead to a strategic equality in</p>

          <p>the nhs so you might link it to race</p>

          <p>data this is particularly personal when</p>

          <p>you're thinking about</p>

          <p>on workforce like when you're thinking</p>

          <p>about the makeup of your team</p>

          <p>um how people progress how you support</p>

          <p>career</p>

          <p>progression because the nhs is actually</p>

          <p>quite diverse but as you</p>

          <p>as you travel up that diversity doesn't</p>

          <p>translate in terms of race</p>

          <p>um and you know there are also kind of</p>

          <p>strategic priorities that your</p>

          <p>organization will have that your trust</p>

          <p>will have</p>

          <p>your trust will have I’m I’m pretty sure</p>

          <p>that all nhs trusts will have like</p>

          <p>some sort of EDI strategic objectives</p>

          <p>um and what what are those how can you</p>

          <p>kind of link it into those</p>

          <p>like you need to think about all of</p>

          <p>those things to kind of help make the</p>

          <p>business case</p>

          <p>almost um you kind of have to treat</p>

          <p>everything like it's a business case</p>

          <p>because the moral code alone sometimes</p>

          <p>won't win the day so sometimes you have</p>

          <p>to</p>

          <p>you have to put your librarian and do a</p>

          <p>bit of research and say here's the data</p>

          <p>this is why we should do it so</p>

          <p>um there's lots of data out there for</p>

          <p>example about why um</p>

          <p>not diversifying your workforce will</p>

          <p>result in um you know</p>

          <p>less a less rich pool of talent and then</p>

          <p>that has an economic impact on your</p>

          <p>organization</p>

          <p>you need to kind of yeah put your</p>

          <p>research hat on</p>

          <p>and and find what the what the kind of</p>

          <p>data is and what the argument is</p>

          <p>to do this kind of thing whatever the</p>

          <p>change is</p>

          <p>another one I was going to suggest is um</p>

          <p>about</p>

          <p>if you just have an ethnic minority or a</p>

          <p>black staff network</p>

          <p>it might be useful to link in with them</p>

          <p>because as Hong-Anh says</p>

          <p>there's strategic priorities around</p>

          <p>these issues you know if you're chair of</p>

          <p>your</p>

          <p>same network is saying where's the edi</p>

          <p>stuff in the library</p>

          <p>that's going to perhaps carry a bit more</p>

          <p>weight then and you sending it to</p>

          <p>your boss maybe yeah that's a really</p>

          <p>good shout out</p>

          <p>definitely yeah find yours what is your</p>

          <p>um peers in your organization find your</p>

          <p>supporters</p>

          <p>like you're trying to do things that</p>

          <p>you're just more distant</p>

          <p>you're not the only one who's trying to</p>

          <p>make this change so you need to try and</p>

          <p>find the other people and join up</p>

          <p>um and be strategic about it yeah</p>

          <p>so if for example you want to kind of</p>

          <p>diversify your collection</p>

          <p>um but you know there are budget</p>

          <p>constraints and there's a bit of</p>

          <p>resistance</p>

          <p>about it can you argue that it's good</p>

          <p>for self well-being can you argue that</p>

          <p>it links into kind of</p>

          <p>like greater thinking around health</p>

          <p>inequalities and how that interacts with</p>

          <p>race inequality</p>

          <p>and that's actually quite an important</p>

          <p>dimension to speak about because</p>

          <p>at a health policy level that's</p>

          <p>something that people are starting to</p>

          <p>think about you know</p>

          <p>you need to kind of cast your net</p>

          <p>quite broadly</p>

          <p>that's great I think that's that's a lot</p>

          <p>of practical</p>

          <p>steps that people can take to start</p>

          <p>thinking about how they</p>

          <p>affect that positive change upwards</p>

          <p>um I don't think we've got anything</p>

          <p>that's come from on the chat on that</p>

          <p>topic so she'll move on to our next</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>yeah yeah</p>

          <p>so and this has been a big one we had</p>

          <p>lots of um discussion about this on on</p>

          <p>slido what does it mean to decolonize a</p>

          <p>library in a healthcare</p>

          <p>context okay</p>

          <p>so um decolonization</p>

          <p>as I understand it is about sort of um</p>

          <p>changing the focus from</p>

          <p>um things that have been largely built</p>

          <p>and designed around</p>

          <p>cisgender white specific male</p>

          <p>white people and making things</p>

          <p>yeah more diverse so in</p>

          <p>our health care library I think there's</p>

          <p>lots of ways that we can do it</p>

          <p>um we can talk about collections but</p>

          <p>we've also talked about the training</p>

          <p>aspects as well uh raising awareness</p>

          <p>to those kind of examples um</p>

          <p>and yeah the um things that we've got</p>

          <p>over about the</p>

          <p>lack of diversity of images and stuff</p>

          <p>that's really topical at the moment I</p>

          <p>don't know people have seen on twitter</p>

          <p>there is a student at saint george's</p>

          <p>uh university who has um</p>

          <p>written a book about recognizing</p>

          <p>clinical signs in black and brown skin</p>

          <p>he's done it as part of a student</p>

          <p>project he's a medical student</p>

          <p>and this is being hailed as a big thing</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>it's a first over</p>

          <p>and that's kind of incredible when you</p>

          <p>think about it but</p>

          <p>this should be down to the unpaid labour</p>

          <p>of a</p>

          <p>medical student to reduce this kind of</p>

          <p>resource</p>

          <p>but these are the kind of things that</p>

          <p>we're thinking of um</p>

          <p>these pictures these resources should be</p>

          <p>more available</p>

          <p>and when we say decolonized we're not</p>

          <p>just talking about the race agenda we're</p>

          <p>talking about um</p>

          <p>gender we're talking about um lgbtq+</p>

          <p>issues as well</p>

          <p>and um which have a knock-on effect in</p>

          <p>health</p>

          <p>and health outcomes so it's really</p>

          <p>thinking wisely</p>

          <p>uh interrogating our collections what</p>

          <p>voices are being heard</p>

          <p>what voices aren't being heard and</p>

          <p>in the collections and in the terms that</p>

          <p>we use as Hong-Anh said earlier the index</p>

          <p>terms that we use as well</p>

          <p>yeah I think the example that you use of</p>

          <p>the um</p>

          <p>uh the medical students who've put</p>

          <p>together this resource I mean</p>

          <p>uh that absolutely shouldn't be</p>

          <p>something that someone has taken on as</p>

          <p>unpaid labour</p>

          <p>um and I guess my my challenge to us as</p>

          <p>the profession is as a profession we</p>

          <p>have significant economic power um when</p>

          <p>it comes to publishers for example what</p>

          <p>could we do to affect change</p>

          <p>as a whole profession of health care</p>

          <p>librarians when we're thinking about</p>

          <p>um what what's missing um</p>

          <p>so we know that in dermatology yeah like</p>

          <p>there are</p>

          <p>there are no uh there's no diversity</p>

          <p>in how skin conditions show up on</p>

          <p>different colour skins because they do</p>

          <p>present differently</p>

          <p>um a really pertinent example of this at</p>

          <p>the moment is um in Covid actually</p>

          <p>so one of the symptoms of clothing is a</p>

          <p>rash</p>

          <p>about 20% of covid patients present with</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>um but all the exams like the majority</p>

          <p>of the examples</p>

          <p>uh photographic examples we have of how this rash looks is on white skin</p>

          <p>and there are very little examples</p>

          <p>photographic examples of how this looks</p>

          <p>on</p>

          <p>Asian skin on Black skin um and so it</p>

          <p>looks different and this might be a</p>

          <p>crucial thing that is being missed</p>

          <p>in a certain section of population and</p>

          <p>we already know that</p>

          <p>outcomes and covid for um particular</p>

          <p>ethnic groups</p>

          <p>is very different um than it is in white</p>

          <p>groups so</p>

          <p>um actually the um the cover tracking</p>

          <p>app that</p>

          <p>um is uh developed by zoe is the one</p>

          <p>that's been used quite a lot in the uk</p>

          <p>at the moment I’m sure</p>

          <p>a lot of people on this call um can</p>

          <p>say they're every day on it</p>

          <p>and they put out a call for people to um</p>

          <p>send in pictures if</p>

          <p>if they had experienced the rash and um</p>

          <p>you know</p>

          <p>uh weren't from um a caucasian</p>

          <p>background</p>

          <p>um and so we could have examples of that</p>

          <p>so</p>

          <p>um so yeah it has kind of real world</p>

          <p>consequences this kind of stuff</p>

          <p>um and what Natasha said as well about</p>

          <p>it applying to kind of other</p>

          <p>characteristics as well so</p>

          <p>for anyone who's read like the Caroline</p>

          <p>Criado-Perez Invisible Women</p>

          <p>there's quite a lot there about how um</p>

          <p>medical research has historically</p>

          <p>erased women from a lot of trials</p>

          <p>um and consequently our understanding</p>

          <p>our medical model of understanding some</p>

          <p>conditions is based on how it presents</p>

          <p>in men for example so</p>

          <p>um so again it's about that kind of real</p>

          <p>world consequence so I think</p>

          <p>for us as um</p>

          <p>as healthcare librarians as information</p>

          <p>professionals we need to</p>

          <p>get ahead of a curve right we need to</p>

          <p>understand where the gaps in our</p>

          <p>knowledge are</p>

          <p>and be conscious of that and think think</p>

          <p>about that bear that in mind when we</p>

          <p>carry out literature searches when we</p>

          <p>think about our collections</p>

          <p>and you know that's on our speed</p>

          <p>that's great thank you we've actually</p>

          <p>had some a really good question</p>

          <p>um um Shakira has uh shared the</p>

          <p>information on the mind the gap book</p>

          <p>that you were talking about from</p>

          <p>Saint George's if you were interested in</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>we can add that link into our resources</p>

          <p>list actually can't we</p>

          <p>yeah lovely thank you that would be</p>

          <p>great so</p>

          <p>um Camilla has asked uh when we do</p>

          <p>literature searches on eg dermatological</p>

          <p>conditions and darker skin</p>

          <p>sometimes it seems that there is very</p>

          <p>little research or no research</p>

          <p>is there an organization or somewhere we</p>

          <p>can report these research gaps to</p>

          <p>somewhere that is able to pass on the</p>

          <p>message that most research is needed on</p>

          <p>x y and z, wow that's, if</p>

          <p>there is a place yes great question we</p>

          <p>we should try and find out I wonder if</p>

          <p>they're in</p>

          <p>yeah I wonder if nihr is a good place</p>

          <p>to report that so that's the national</p>

          <p>institute for health research they're</p>

          <p>the main funding body</p>

          <p>for nhs research and they give out grants</p>

          <p>for research conducted in the nhs</p>

          <p>and I think one of their remits is to</p>

          <p>try and correct like gaps in the</p>

          <p>knowledge</p>

          <p>in the evidence so um that might be one</p>

          <p>that comes to mind but that's definitely</p>

          <p>something we should go away and look at</p>

          <p>and we might add that to the reading</p>

          <p>list</p>

          <p>I’m wondering if if if some of these</p>

          <p>like some more</p>

          <p>say like Runnymede Trust or whatever</p>

          <p>might have some ideas as well</p>

          <p>yeah some other like that it's a think</p>

          <p>tank isn't it so um</p>

          <p>yeah yeah yeah that's a really good</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>with action to take away yeah and they’re</p>

          <p>really well placed to kind of spot that</p>

          <p>kind of thing and report it</p>

          <p>sorry just flicking back and forth</p>

          <p>through the chat and I’m using myself</p>

          <p>there's been another um uh suggestion</p>

          <p>here from Suzanne Wilson she says the</p>

          <p>James Lind alliance</p>

          <p>and she's put the link in which we will</p>

          <p>add to our resources pack thank you</p>

          <p>susanne that's really</p>

          <p>okay should we move on to our next</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>so how can libraries promote their edi</p>

          <p>collections and encourage engagement</p>

          <p>with this topic through the resources</p>

          <p>that they provide</p>

          <p>so this is a great question um</p>

          <p>and I think you know um</p>

          <p>I don't think it's a case of doing</p>

          <p>anything extra</p>

          <p>over and above what you already do in</p>

          <p>your services</p>

          <p>and in the services that you provide</p>

          <p>it's about rethinking all of those</p>

          <p>activities you do</p>

          <p>with a different lens thinking about it</p>

          <p>through the edi</p>

          <p>the edi lens um and so like Natasha's</p>

          <p>already given a great example of this</p>

          <p>in terms of like things about training</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>you know like could you if you host a</p>

          <p>journal club for example</p>

          <p>um could you use that journal club model</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>use it to host discussions around</p>

          <p>diversity where you</p>

          <p>um you could use not only like</p>

          <p>clinical uh like clinical research but</p>

          <p>you could use maybe like um</p>

          <p>a think piece that is about an aspect of</p>

          <p>uh diversity and inclusion that you</p>

          <p>think it's really useful to have a</p>

          <p>conversation about</p>

          <p>um and so you give people that reading</p>

          <p>and then it's up to you you have the</p>

          <p>physical space and you can kind of host</p>

          <p>the space to have that discussion</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>uh one that kind of provides</p>

          <p>lifelong learning continuous learning</p>

          <p>opportunities which is</p>

          <p>you know that's our jam that's what we</p>

          <p>do um</p>

          <p>and it's it's continuing to engage um</p>

          <p>people with your servers who may maybe</p>

          <p>they don't need to use the library</p>

          <p>in their day-to-day job but this is like</p>

          <p>again proving that</p>

          <p>this the service library can be relevant</p>

          <p>to their professional development</p>

          <p>in a different way</p>

          <p>yep yes I really like that um that</p>

          <p>lifelong learning idea and I think that</p>

          <p>some of the questions</p>

          <p>specifically about black history month</p>

          <p>and stuff I think sometimes we sort of</p>

          <p>think oh you know</p>

          <p>Black History Month or five months is it</p>

          <p>really relevant to what we're doing well</p>

          <p>actually</p>

          <p>I think these are things that many of us</p>

          <p>need to learn more about and it will</p>

          <p>benefit us not just in our work but in</p>

          <p>our</p>

          <p>home lives as well so I think it's a</p>

          <p>really good opportunity to</p>

          <p>have those conversations and also you</p>

          <p>know</p>

          <p>it can be fun as well it doesn't have to</p>

          <p>be really serious you know</p>

          <p>the one about activity ideas for Black</p>

          <p>History Month well yeah you could get</p>

          <p>people to read that you could also get</p>

          <p>people to watch a film</p>

          <p>you know a podcast uh that kind of thing</p>

          <p>um and have a</p>

          <p>comedy sketch even and have a discussion</p>

          <p>about it so</p>

          <p>um yeah yeah yeah and that's a great</p>

          <p>point about like yeah it doesn't</p>

          <p>it doesn't have to be po faced so um</p>

          <p>we had pride week at the fund recently</p>

          <p>and one thing we did was</p>

          <p>to host a quiz um but the quiz was an</p>

          <p>educational quiz so</p>

          <p>all the questions were centered around</p>

          <p>um lgbt history</p>

          <p>um so it was educational as well as</p>

          <p>being a social activity</p>

          <p>one of the questions about encouraging</p>

          <p>engagement and encouraging people to</p>

          <p>join in one of the phrases that our</p>

          <p>ethnic minority network</p>

          <p>uses is um remember opening events out</p>

          <p>to everybody</p>

          <p>we did this yesterday um they said we</p>

          <p>would like attendance to reflect the</p>

          <p>makeup</p>

          <p>of the organization so we want sixty</p>

          <p>percent white staff forty percent</p>

          <p>BAME and they pretty much got it</p>

          <p>um pretty much the stats debate they</p>

          <p>were doing a slider on it um</p>

          <p>yeah so I think I think sometimes</p>

          <p>people think things aren't for them so</p>

          <p>you have to and that's something we're</p>

          <p>doing in the recruitment isn't it you</p>

          <p>know making it obvious we want</p>

          <p>applications from underrepresented</p>

          <p>groups</p>

          <p>we're saying for these kind of</p>

          <p>activities as well</p>

          <p>yeah yeah and I think that's that's a</p>

          <p>really good point Natasha is that um</p>

          <p>often like edi stuff can kind of</p>

          <p>attract a certain crowd and it can</p>

          <p>either attract people who</p>

          <p>you know um they're attracted to it</p>

          <p>because it reflects</p>

          <p>their lived experience and so you know</p>

          <p>if they people want to get involved</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>it is really about directly influencing</p>

          <p>change to make</p>

          <p>their own experience of the workplace</p>

          <p>better um</p>

          <p>or it can be people who are kind of um</p>

          <p>you know really allied to the cause and</p>

          <p>quite active and</p>

          <p>um already quite active uh in that space</p>

          <p>um and I think for people who are newer</p>

          <p>to the conversation it can feel</p>

          <p>um it can feel scary to join that</p>

          <p>and when there's there might be a gap in</p>

          <p>where they are on their journey and</p>

          <p>where other people are on their journey</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>you know often people don't want to get</p>

          <p>involved in stuff like this because</p>

          <p>they're scared of saying the wrong thing</p>

          <p>or they're scared that it's not a space</p>

          <p>for them so being really explicit about</p>

          <p>what we expect</p>

          <p>is really important and saying you know</p>

          <p>we expect everyone to get involved in</p>

          <p>this because this is a problem</p>

          <p>not only for um black and brown people to solve</p>

          <p>it's a problem for everyone to solve</p>

          <p>I think that fits in really well to</p>

          <p>another question we have that is on</p>

          <p>the slide around</p>

          <p>um being an ally so somebody had</p>

          <p>recently taken part in ally training</p>

          <p>provided by the trust lgbtq plus network</p>

          <p>and they wondered what your thoughts</p>

          <p>were on staff becoming an ally</p>

          <p>oh that's really um that's really timely</p>

          <p>question because we um the call I was</p>

          <p>talking about just now was brought out of the lgbt+ network and allies</p>

          <p>and um I think it can be</p>

          <p>really powerful um as long as we're</p>

          <p>clear on what the ask is and one of&nbsp;</p>

          <p>the slides we had on the call</p>

          <p>yesterday was</p>

          <p>what an ally is not what you mustn’t do and</p>

          <p>then they were giving and then there was</p>

          <p>another slightly different thing to do</p>

          <p>um and and I’ve heard this from our</p>

          <p>lgbtq</p>

          <p>network um when they launched their</p>

          <p>allies scheme they gave everybody this</p>

          <p>nice little badge</p>

          <p>and they've sort of thrown there a few</p>

          <p>months long it's not just about the</p>

          <p>badge we actually need people to</p>

          <p>do stuff so one good thing on our call</p>

          <p>yesterday if we had all our senior</p>

          <p>integrated care directors</p>

          <p>and our chief executives even making</p>

          <p>pledges about things that they are going</p>

          <p>to do</p>

          <p>to demonstrate that allyship and so</p>

          <p>they're going to be held accountable</p>

          <p>by the network by the organization for</p>

          <p>the things they said on the</p>

          <p>or on the call yesterday um one thing</p>

          <p>we haven't got on the reading list that</p>

          <p>we should add um</p>

          <p>Yvonne Coghill um who was</p>

          <p>with the red team I’m not sure if she</p>

          <p>still is but she's still obviously</p>

          <p>operating this area she just did a seven</p>

          <p>days of allyship</p>

          <p>slide thing that's been going around on</p>

          <p>twitter that was really good it's just</p>

          <p>on one page</p>

          <p>um we should add that to the reading</p>

          <p>list</p>

          <p>yeah actions yeah yeah and I think you</p>

          <p>know</p>

          <p>um I think the key for the key thing for</p>

          <p>me in terms of allyship is that you need</p>

          <p>to be active</p>

          <p>at my ship um allyship to kind of signal</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>you're for the cause is great but we</p>

          <p>need to go one further</p>

          <p>we we need we need white people to step</p>

          <p>up</p>

          <p>and actually help us push this boulder</p>

          <p>up the hill because</p>

          <p>um if it's only people from an ethnic</p>

          <p>minority background pushing that boulder</p>

          <p>up the hill then</p>

          <p>you know if you think about it you're</p>

          <p>perpetuating the same problem it's</p>

          <p>it's unpaid labour it's work on an</p>

          <p>underrepresented group to fix the</p>

          <p>problems that have been</p>

          <p>created by a dominant group so um</p>

          <p>allyship can look like a lot of</p>

          <p>different things yeah it can look like</p>

          <p>personal commitment</p>

          <p>it can look like um</p>

          <p>you know being the person to take on the</p>

          <p>difficult conversation</p>

          <p>so that your colleague from an ethnic</p>

          <p>minority background doesn't have to</p>

          <p>if someone has said something in a</p>

          <p>meeting that you know doesn't sit well</p>

          <p>with you</p>

          <p>maybe maybe that's like a really great</p>

          <p>thing you can do is to kind of</p>

          <p>call that out um so that it's it's less</p>

          <p>of a fraught conversation for the person</p>

          <p>who</p>

          <p>has the least power in that situation um</p>

          <p>yeah so it's just about thinking about</p>

          <p>what you can do</p>

          <p>um one of the questions on the slide</p>

          <p>uh is about you know are they good</p>

          <p>examples of um</p>

          <p>trust implementing training where people</p>

          <p>can feel the lived experiences of stuff</p>

          <p>I say another kind of really important</p>

          <p>thing you can do as an ally is</p>

          <p>to not rely on people</p>

          <p>having to kind of mine some of their</p>

          <p>traumatic experiences so that you can</p>

          <p>learn</p>

          <p>there's a lot out there already um you</p>

          <p>know there are people there are talented</p>

          <p>authors podcasters</p>

          <p>screenwriters actors who have all kind</p>

          <p>of</p>

          <p>um created stuff that help you</p>

          <p>understand what that lived experience is</p>

          <p>like</p>

          <p>um it's a tough ask to ask your</p>

          <p>colleagues</p>

          <p>to share that because it can be risky</p>

          <p>you know like</p>

          <p>if um if you experience the workplace in</p>

          <p>a different way and then you're being</p>

          <p>asked to kind of</p>

          <p>disclose how different that is and how</p>

          <p>bad that is for you</p>

          <p>that's a really tough place to be put in</p>

          <p>um and just to say yeah one thing that</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>I’ve added to the reading list is that</p>

          <p>the King’s Trust have recently</p>

          <p>published a piece of research which</p>

          <p>includes some</p>

          <p>data of that ilk that is anonymized so</p>

          <p>that helps give you a flavour but there</p>

          <p>is</p>

          <p>plenty out there that's written on this</p>

          <p>and specifically in the nhs context as</p>

          <p>well</p>

          <p>just a couple of things out there Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>yeah we shouldn't be asking our</p>

          <p>colleagues to</p>

          <p>to relive their horrible experiences but</p>

          <p>if you're going to pay somebody who does</p>

          <p>this for a living to</p>

          <p>you know facilitate those conversations</p>

          <p>or just um</p>

          <p>uh interpret that for you then there are</p>

          <p>several good people out there who can</p>

          <p>have those conversations</p>

          <p>and and take that um because they're</p>

          <p>paid to do it</p>

          <p>rather than your staff having to do it</p>

          <p>the other one is um</p>

          <p>I just recently came across and it's on</p>

          <p>the reading list um this thing called</p>

          <p>hexitime I don't know if people have</p>

          <p>seen it</p>

          <p>it's uh like a time banking thing and</p>

          <p>they have running a campaign about</p>

          <p>supporting BAME colleagues because</p>

          <p>several of my um several of my white</p>

          <p>mostly male colleagues have signed up</p>

          <p>for that this week</p>

          <p>that offered to do things like interview</p>

          <p>coaching um and mentoring</p>

          <p>for um more junior um</p>

          <p>new qualified allied health</p>

          <p>professionals for example so</p>

          <p>that might be something you think you</p>

          <p>that you could do and I'll also be</p>

          <p>outside your work as well</p>

          <p>you know um actually um I’m so nobody</p>

          <p>can stop you from doing it if you want</p>

          <p>to offer a mentor</p>

          <p>or give interview and practice for</p>

          <p>somebody</p>

          <p>thank you I think um I think you've kind</p>

          <p>of gone into some of these</p>

          <p>examples that this next question has</p>

          <p>asked but um</p>

          <p>Richard has said what does it</p>

          <p>mean to help as an old white middle</p>

          <p>class guy I’m aware</p>

          <p>I don't want to patronize or mansplain</p>

          <p>to people what concrete things can I do</p>

          <p>I think the fact that you know the word</p>

          <p>mansplain means that you're probably</p>

          <p>you're on the right lines there</p>

          <p>I that I always appreciate when my older</p>

          <p>white colleagues do that is um when they</p>

          <p>say my name when I’m not there</p>

          <p>or when they reference work that I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>done when I will bring me into a</p>

          <p>conversation about something I can help</p>

          <p>with</p>

          <p>that there's people you can do that for</p>

          <p>yeah um like I said before you can be</p>

          <p>the person to have a difficult</p>

          <p>conversation too</p>

          <p>so harking back to one of the earlier</p>

          <p>questions about resistance</p>

          <p>if um people are trying to make change</p>

          <p>um about something chances are that um</p>

          <p>as a white</p>

          <p>white man people might listen to you</p>

          <p>more than they do to other people</p>

          <p>um than they do to a woman of colour so</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>you know you're you're you can utilize</p>

          <p>your privilege for good</p>

          <p>thanks that was great okay so</p>

          <p>this is a big topic as well actually it</p>

          <p>came up what should library collections</p>

          <p>relating to</p>

          <p>equality diversity and inclusion or BAME</p>

          <p>groups be called what language would be</p>

          <p>most appropriate and least offensive</p>

          <p>so we've put some stuff on the reading</p>

          <p>list about the different terms haven't</p>

          <p>we Hong-Anh because there's</p>

          <p>there's a lot to unpick with them</p>

          <p>yeah there is um we've actually been</p>

          <p>having this conversation quite a lot</p>

          <p>at fund recently um</p>

          <p>partially I think because we've realized</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>one of the reasons why we what the</p>

          <p>consequence of us</p>

          <p>having historically not done that much</p>

          <p>work about it is that we don't have the</p>

          <p>confidence to talk about it because we</p>

          <p>feel like we don't have the language and</p>

          <p>language is so often a barrier in terms</p>

          <p>of people trying to get involved in this</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>people don't want to offend um</p>

          <p><br />
          so like I think the key thing here is</p>

          <p>that there is</p>

          <p>this is not going to be very helpful but</p>

          <p>there is no right or wrong</p>

          <p>so I’m fine with the term BAME being</p>

          <p>used</p>

          <p>other people aren't I’m okay with it</p>

          <p>being used in certain contexts</p>

          <p>so I think it's I think where you use</p>

          <p>terms you have to use them meaningfully</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>ensure that you've put some thought into</p>

          <p>it so</p>

          <p>BAME is okay if what you mean is</p>

          <p>actually</p>

          <p>Black Asian and Ethnic Minority bame is</p>

          <p>not okay if you are only referring to a</p>

          <p>few of those groups for example</p>

          <p>um I I think</p>

          <p>language is loaded and it just means</p>

          <p>that um</p>

          <p>it means something different to everyone</p>

          <p>else so</p>

          <p>I think as long as you make the decision</p>

          <p>and you've done your research</p>

          <p>research and you're able to say why</p>

          <p>you've made that decision</p>

          <p>that is that is the best approach to</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>so an example is um at the fund we uh</p>

          <p>used</p>

          <p>capital b for Black and we had a</p>

          <p>discussion about what that why that</p>

          <p>is and um because you know Black is not</p>

          <p>it's not an ethnicity but there is um</p>

          <p>a political dimension to it in terms of</p>

          <p>it's</p>

          <p>you know it's a social construct um that</p>

          <p>is recognized so</p>

          <p>it is used with capital b but</p>

          <p>there's also discussion about whether</p>

          <p>you should also capitalise the w</p>

          <p>in white um and the capital w and white</p>

          <p>is sometimes associated with</p>

          <p>white supremacy but then also if you</p>

          <p>don't capitalize it then</p>

          <p>it plays into that whole thing of like</p>

          <p>uh white people not recognizing that</p>

          <p>they are also holders of race</p>

          <p>races not only held by people who aren't</p>

          <p>white</p>

          <p>so it's really complex and messy but</p>

          <p>just do your research and and figure out</p>

          <p>where you fall</p>

          <p>on it and why you've made those</p>

          <p>decisions so that if you get called out</p>

          <p>on it if people want to know why you've</p>

          <p>made that decision you can have a</p>

          <p>meaningful conversation about it</p>

          <p>thank you I don't know Natasha do you</p>

          <p>have anything to add to that</p>

          <p>no I suppose I might just say something</p>

          <p>about um</p>

          <p>a question saying about collections</p>

          <p>related to edI or BAME groups and i</p>

          <p>think I like the idea more of having an</p>

          <p>edi</p>

          <p>collection because you know we're</p>

          <p>thinking about this holistically</p>

          <p>everything about all</p>

          <p>trying to think about all the detective</p>

          <p>characteristics</p>

          <p>and it would be nice to make sure you</p>

          <p>have stuff covering all of those</p>

          <p>different label groups as well and i</p>

          <p>don't know maybe it depends on how big</p>

          <p>your collection is maybe</p>

          <p>I don't think i'd have enough to have</p>

          <p>separate reading this drawer</p>

          <p>okay so maybe you've gone</p>

          <p>I think that's a really good point as</p>

          <p>well because it takes into that idea of</p>

          <p>intersectionality as well so you know</p>

          <p>we should be thinking about all the</p>

          <p>characteristics and all these different</p>

          <p>characteristics don't sit in silos</p>

          <p>um you know so um it's really important</p>

          <p>to yeah</p>

          <p>think about it holistically</p>

          <p>fab right we have some chats going on</p>

          <p>um and some of these relate a bit back</p>

          <p>to some of the previous questions so i'm</p>

          <p>just going to go through them</p>

          <p>um as they've cropped up okay</p>

          <p>so William has asked would you like</p>

          <p>diversity engagement</p>

          <p>assessed by health education for example</p>

          <p>as part of the quality</p>

          <p>impact outcome framework assessment</p>

          <p>do we are we thinking about equality and</p>

          <p>diversity of library knowledge services</p>

          <p>as part of the new</p>

          <p>is that what we're saying I think so</p>

          <p>yeah</p>

          <p>being specified whether it's workforce</p>

          <p>or library</p>

          <p>services stuff but um I suppose either</p>

          <p>or both</p>

          <p>well I think we we are in the refresh of</p>

          <p>the knowledge for healthcare</p>

          <p>you've got diversity is much more</p>

          <p>explicit in there</p>

          <p>in the um driver diagrams and things</p>

          <p>um i</p>

          <p>oh I’m not sure I’m not sure I have a</p>

          <p>library with my library manager hat on i</p>

          <p>think the quality improvement outcomes</p>

          <p>is</p>

          <p>big enough and the other thing is like</p>

          <p>Hong-Anh talks saying you know we</p>

          <p>shouldn't be doing any new stuff</p>

          <p>this stuff should become mainstream and</p>

          <p>should be part of um you know</p>

          <p>the way that we make sure that our</p>

          <p>collections are are comprehensive and</p>

          <p>addressing all the relevant issues for</p>

          <p>our</p>

          <p>organizations yeah</p>

          <p>no I don't think so I I think it</p>

          <p>depends</p>

          <p>so I I think I think it depends on</p>

          <p>how we want to encourage libraries to</p>

          <p>pay attention to this</p>

          <p>so one way to do it is through that</p>

          <p>means I don't work in an nhs library so</p>

          <p>I have no idea of</p>

          <p>um what it means to kind of do the the</p>

          <p>quality framework assessment</p>

          <p>and what that might add if we we add</p>

          <p>that in it but</p>

          <p>I think there are other ways to try and</p>

          <p>encourage</p>

          <p>um people like libraries to pay</p>

          <p>attention to edi</p>

          <p>in their services it doesn't just have</p>

          <p>to be through this</p>

          <p>and if we if it was included it</p>

          <p>shouldn't be only through that either</p>

          <p>yeah I I think I agree with you and I</p>

          <p>attended some training yesterday</p>

          <p>actually on um the legalities of</p>

          <p>equality diversity and human rights and</p>

          <p>and they made a really interesting</p>

          <p>point that we can be using our equality</p>

          <p>impact assessments</p>

          <p>on um things like developing new</p>

          <p>teaching programs</p>

          <p>to ensure that we're checking that</p>

          <p>everything is inclusive</p>

          <p>we've explored all options when we're</p>

          <p>doing those things so that might be</p>

          <p>something to think about</p>

          <p>for us as well</p>

          <p>okay back to the chat there's lots of</p>

          <p>things going on</p>

          <p>um so Shakira has said how to navigate</p>

          <p>these conversations with colleagues</p>

          <p>as a black woman I almost anticipate</p>

          <p>ignorant comments and don't feel it is</p>

          <p>my duty to emotionally drain myself</p>

          <p>should just I be more involved um</p>

          <p>no I think you need to be the priority I</p>

          <p>think is you need to look after yourself</p>

          <p>if you don't feel you can do it in the</p>

          <p>moment or ever then then I don't think</p>

          <p>it's for you to take it on</p>

          <p>I I don't think um I</p>

          <p>I’m talking to some older colleagues</p>

          <p>the group I I was having a</p>

          <p>conversation with the</p>

          <p>I don't think she's on the call today</p>

          <p>but she was sort of saying you know we</p>

          <p>were doing this work 20 years ago</p>

          <p>in libraries then it kind of dropped off</p>

          <p>and I come back and she's like I just</p>

          <p>want to get on with my job</p>

          <p>um and so I think it's for those who</p>

          <p>have the energy right now me and hang</p>

          <p>out and got a bit of energy right now</p>

          <p>to do this work and then you know maybe</p>

          <p>we'll step back and some other people</p>

          <p>will take it up in a couple of years um</p>

          <p>I'm</p>

          <p>sorry you have to anticipate those</p>

          <p>comments and it's just it's just</p>

          <p>draining because</p>

          <p>I think speaking for myself I don't want</p>

          <p>to be talking about this I just like to</p>

          <p>get on with my life</p>

          <p>and just be me but</p>

          <p>you know we can't get away from it and</p>

          <p>uh yeah</p>

          <p>yeah I would totally agree it's</p>

          <p>yeah you need to make the best decision</p>

          <p>for you</p>

          <p>and um if you if you don't want to</p>

          <p>engage in those conversations</p>

          <p>don't it's if if the emotional burden of</p>

          <p>it is too much</p>

          <p>if it takes away from you progressing in</p>

          <p>your career</p>

          <p>using time for your own career</p>

          <p>progression for other things in your</p>

          <p>life that are valuable</p>

          <p>no don't do it um you know like I think</p>

          <p>I I saw a tweet the other day which was</p>

          <p>about kind of um</p>

          <p>imagine all like the great black writers</p>

          <p>if if they if racism</p>

          <p>didn't exist</p>

          <p>what would their work be about but as it</p>

          <p>is they had to devote their intellectual</p>

          <p>energy</p>

          <p>to writing about this stuff you do not</p>

          <p>have to devote your energy to that</p>

          <p>um if you want to then that's great but</p>

          <p>as we've said before the push is not for</p>

          <p>um it's for everyone to pick up this</p>

          <p>baton</p>

          <p>um and no one can do this work</p>

          <p>indefinitely</p>

          <p>and yeah I like Natasha like this is not</p>

          <p>this is not necessarily what I want to</p>

          <p>be spending my time on but</p>

          <p>here we are</p>

          <p>[Laughter]</p>

          <p>um what I will say is that</p>

          <p>uh it's not like I don't get anything</p>

          <p>from this work so it's been really</p>

          <p>developmental for me being involved in</p>

          <p>this work it's really helped me to build</p>

          <p>um skills and stuff that maybe i</p>

          <p>wouldn't have gotten the chance to</p>

          <p>at this point in my career in a library</p>

          <p>role</p>

          <p>so my ability to kind of</p>

          <p>um influence upwards has really been</p>

          <p>honed</p>

          <p>by um being involved in edI work um in</p>

          <p>thinking kind of really strategically</p>

          <p>for example I probably wouldn't be able</p>

          <p>to do that unless I’ve got</p>

          <p>up to the next rung of the ladder in my</p>

          <p>career so</p>

          <p>there are benefits but it's up to you to</p>

          <p>decide</p>

          <p>what the trade-off is between like your</p>

          <p>emotional</p>

          <p>mental health because it is draining and</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>whether you want to kind of progress</p>

          <p>your career in that way and through this</p>

          <p>channel</p>

          <p>yeah so i'll just come in again they're</p>

          <p>hanging just to echo about what you're</p>

          <p>saying the work what I'm</p>

          <p>starting to do now with the ethnic</p>

          <p>minority network being a strategic</p>

          <p>ambassador means you know I’m in contact</p>

          <p>with all these much senior</p>

          <p>members of staff one there that keeps</p>

          <p>from and really enjoying getting to know</p>

          <p>them as well</p>

          <p>and the other thing we're talking about</p>

          <p>careers is that it's only in the last</p>

          <p>couple of years I’ve started talking</p>

          <p>about these issues and that's because</p>

          <p>I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>been around for a long time now um I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>been at that stage in my career where i</p>

          <p>feel comfortable having a talk about</p>

          <p>these issues</p>

          <p>when I was first qualified in my first</p>

          <p>job I wouldn't</p>

          <p>have wanted to go there and I it might</p>

          <p>have been unwise to have gone there</p>

          <p>whereas now I’m not that I’m untouchable</p>

          <p>but it's just a bit more</p>

          <p>it's just a perhaps a bit more with age</p>

          <p>as well at ease with myself I guess</p>

          <p>um the other thing I was saying you're</p>

          <p>saying about what you get out of it</p>

          <p>um I’ve told you to Hong-Anh before is</p>

          <p>that I do feel</p>

          <p>when I do this work it's one of the ways</p>

          <p>I like that I honour the ancestors</p>

          <p>and really just be thankful for the fact</p>

          <p>that you know</p>

          <p>people who went through hideous time you</p>

          <p>know I’m here and I'm</p>

          <p>able to feel bits to try and make things</p>

          <p>better for those who are coming after us</p>

          <p>I do get something out of it yeah</p>

          <p>thank you thank you Shakira for the</p>

          <p>question I think that's really powerful</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>certainly personally that makes me feel</p>

          <p>like I should be paying more attention</p>

          <p>to pick up when those things are</p>

          <p>happening so I can step in for my</p>

          <p>colleagues</p>

          <p>and that's definitely on my action list</p>

          <p>from now on</p>

          <p>and Shakira has said thank you as well</p>

          <p>she says thanks for your responses I'm</p>

          <p>sure many um people of colour in</p>

          <p>libraries are outnumbered so it can be</p>

          <p>a daunting task absolutely yeah</p>

          <p>yeah okay um just</p>

          <p>quickly we've had some great uh links</p>

          <p>from -- on</p>

          <p>um writing styles so we will link those</p>

          <p>as well</p>

          <p>because it says we're absolutely</p>

          <p>committed in knowledge for healthcare to</p>

          <p>build growth and develop a diverse and</p>

          <p>inclusive library knowledge services</p>

          <p>workforce</p>

          <p>um but then William does mention and</p>

          <p>this is absolutely true</p>

          <p>I guess diversity isn't once in the</p>

          <p>quality impact outcome framework so</p>

          <p>perhaps even if it isn't assessed it</p>

          <p>should be mentioned</p>

          <p>I think that's a really important point</p>

          <p>I will take back to my colleagues thank</p>

          <p>you William</p>

          <p>um so</p>

          <p>what we're going to do now is I’m going</p>

          <p>to unmute you</p>

          <p>all so if you can just muted</p>

          <p>yourself so we're not</p>

          <p>suddenly inundated with background</p>

          <p>information and then you can ask</p>

          <p>questions if you want to using the hand</p>

          <p>up function</p>

          <p>okay here we go</p>

          <p>you can just mute yourself please</p>

          <p>anybody want to ask a question please</p>

          <p>put your hands up</p>

          <p>I don't see any hands coming up just yet</p>

          <p>you can also still use the chat if you</p>

          <p>want to to ask questions</p>

          <p>or make comments about the things that</p>

          <p>we've been discussing today</p>

          <p>otherwise let me just scroll down a</p>

          <p>little I’ve got</p>

          <p>hand, Bertha I’m just going to come to</p>

          <p>you I’m going to unmute you</p>

          <p>so please ask your question hi uh well</p>

          <p>rather instead of</p>

          <p>a question I just wanted to share things</p>

          <p>that we have been doing here at</p>

          <p>MSC at Southend</p>

          <p>so um I started this job in February</p>

          <p>2019</p>

          <p>and when I first started one of the</p>

          <p>first things was to get involved with</p>

          <p>different groups</p>

          <p>just to attend to the meetings um i</p>

          <p>attended to the faith group</p>

          <p>and I attended to the BAME group so when</p>

          <p>I attended to the BAME group i</p>

          <p>found out that there was so much work</p>

          <p>that we could contribute</p>

          <p>and from then um we started this</p>

          <p>diversity collection</p>

          <p>here and more recently we started this</p>

          <p>inclusion and diversity bulletin</p>

          <p>which has been well received so I think</p>

          <p>for me</p>

          <p>just sharing my experience is um we need</p>

          <p>to be curious</p>

          <p>what what's going on what's around there</p>

          <p>um you know as librarians we think of</p>

          <p>doctors and nurses but there is</p>

          <p>managers their managers their uh</p>

          <p>porters there is so much going on and we</p>

          <p>are not curious to find out what are</p>

          <p>their life and how we can serve them</p>

          <p>then if it's all all these things going</p>

          <p>uh hanging around</p>

          <p>so I don't feel myself &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I</p>

          <p>am um I am not BAME</p>

          <p>but if you see my face and if you hear</p>

          <p>my</p>

          <p>voice then you know that I’m not a white</p>

          <p>british</p>

          <p>but where I come from I’m a white</p>

          <p>privileged person I’m from mexico</p>

          <p>and in that context is how I learn about</p>

          <p>my privilege</p>

          <p>and I still hold this privilege here</p>

          <p>because at some point I just shut down</p>

          <p>but I noticed that if I shut down then i</p>

          <p>don't learn</p>

          <p>and yeah so this is what I wanted to</p>

          <p>share with you</p>

          <p>that's wonderful thank you and I think</p>

          <p>your point about curiosity is so</p>

          <p>important</p>

          <p>um it's a really important trait</p>

          <p>for our profession in general but yeah</p>

          <p>especially for this</p>

          <p>it's about being curious about how other</p>

          <p>people's lives</p>

          <p>are different from yours other people</p>

          <p>have different viewpoints obviously with</p>

          <p>different experiences</p>

          <p>um they're not all necessarily bad but</p>

          <p>they are different</p>

          <p>um and just having that understanding um</p>

          <p>to broaden your worldview is so</p>

          <p>important for this</p>

          <p>yeah thanks Bertha I did actually mean I</p>

          <p>don't know if we did put it on the</p>

          <p>reading list we were going to flag up</p>

          <p>your</p>

          <p>um bulletin if that's okay um but that's</p>

          <p>a result that people might want to</p>

          <p>read for themselves or to um uh forward</p>

          <p>just to subscribe and forward to other</p>

          <p>colleagues in their organization and</p>

          <p>that will do once more share things</p>

          <p>thank you okay I’ve got a question this</p>

          <p>is a good question from the chat</p>

          <p>and from an anonymous person our manager</p>

          <p>is very concerned about us doing</p>

          <p>anything which seems</p>

          <p>political um do you have any suggestions</p>

          <p>for helping to affirm that this is not</p>

          <p>politics but essential work for the</p>

          <p>library</p>

          <p>oh tricky because I think it is</p>

          <p>political isn't it I think the nh</p>

          <p>the nhs is inherently political</p>

          <p>unfortunately</p>

          <p>uh that's not helpful though for the</p>

          <p>question and</p>

          <p>can we bring it back to thinking about</p>

          <p>like we said earlier on about the health</p>

          <p>inequalities about the social</p>

          <p>determinants that kind of</p>

          <p>aspect um how it ties into prevention</p>

          <p>and these kind of things I mean I think</p>

          <p>yeah</p>

          <p>libraries aren't neutral and I think you</p>

          <p>know if you don't</p>

          <p>you don't take a stance you know you're</p>

          <p>on the side of the oppressors</p>

          <p>you know you you I think people should</p>

          <p>be taking a start with pro</p>

          <p>pro equality um and pro-social justice</p>

          <p>and I</p>

          <p>appreciate that it's hard to articulate</p>

          <p>managers</p>

          <p>yeah so um I think it depends on how</p>

          <p>comfortable you feel with having</p>

          <p>a one-to-one conversation with this</p>

          <p>manager but um</p>

          <p>I don't think they mean political I</p>

          <p>think that's a coded word</p>

          <p>I think that what I’m really saying is i</p>

          <p>don't really feel comfortable with this</p>

          <p>or I don't really get what this is about</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>one of the most important things in this</p>

          <p>work is to utilize your personal</p>

          <p>relationships</p>

          <p>because um you know</p>

          <p>there is so much fear and uncertainty</p>

          <p>that people hold around this work</p>

          <p>so actually using your personal</p>

          <p>relationship having those one-to-one</p>

          <p>chats</p>

          <p>they can become a really safe space to</p>

          <p>help people to understand</p>

          <p>um things that maybe they don't have</p>

          <p>space to talk about</p>

          <p>elsewhere so yeah I think if you can</p>

          <p>feel comfortable to have that</p>

          <p>conversation and</p>

          <p>say to them you know what do you mean by</p>

          <p>political um</p>

          <p>why is that necessarily bad why is it</p>

          <p>out of our remit</p>

          <p>this is the way I see it see what</p>

          <p>happens out of that conversation</p>

          <p>because yeah I I don't think they mean political</p>

          <p>[Laughter]</p>

          <p>thank you that is that is tough um</p>

          <p>and it's something and I think um</p>

          <p>you just have to keep talking about it</p>

          <p>yeah yeah um so Bertha said we can</p>

          <p>share the bulletin which is great we</p>

          <p>will definitely do that</p>

          <p>I’m going to come to Trisha now and just</p>

          <p>unmute you because she's got her hand up</p>

          <p>um let me just do some scrolling</p>

          <p>so Trisha</p>

          <p>holly my doorbell's going I’m sorry i'll</p>

          <p>be back in a sec</p>

          <p>no worries um</p>

          <p>I’m just uh wondering</p>

          <p>how far we should be also including</p>

          <p>other people the underserved</p>

          <p>so there are white</p>

          <p>sections of society who are</p>

          <p>discriminated against because of where</p>

          <p>they live</p>

          <p>or how they speak and also</p>

          <p>I just make the point we need to be</p>

          <p>quite careful about the language we use</p>

          <p>you know people still use um</p>

          <p>quite a lot of</p>

          <p>unacceptable language say like</p>

          <p>chav or something like that and</p>

          <p>people use it</p>

          <p>without even thinking about it and I was</p>

          <p>just having a discussion with somebody</p>

          <p>today at work about</p>

          <p>this aspect of it</p>

          <p>yeah yeah I think that's a really good</p>

          <p>point uh I'll just recap for</p>

          <p>Natasha who's just come back as Tricia</p>

          <p>had a point about you know thinking</p>

          <p>about um</p>

          <p>other underrepresented groups so</p>

          <p>thinking about kind of um</p>

          <p>you know uh groups that socioeconomic</p>

          <p>disadvantage for example</p>

          <p>um yeah um I I think this is why</p>

          <p>it's important to take an intersectional</p>

          <p>approach to this this is</p>

          <p>there's an order of uh lord quote that i</p>

          <p>love which is um</p>

          <p>around you know um we don't live</p>

          <p>single issue lives um and</p>

          <p>intersectionality is about that you know</p>

          <p>um if we take up the cause of race</p>

          <p>equality then we're also taking up the</p>

          <p>cause</p>

          <p>of um of lgbt equality too of gender</p>

          <p>equality of um</p>

          <p>classism um ableism you know all those</p>

          <p>things are intertwined</p>

          <p>all oppression is connected so um</p>

          <p>our approach to that should also be</p>

          <p>connected to holistic so yeah absolutely</p>

          <p>that's</p>

          <p>that's uh that's essential for us to</p>

          <p>think about as well</p>

          <p>but also all fashion is connected but</p>

          <p>they're all</p>

          <p>also distinct that they all need</p>

          <p>slightly different approaches to</p>

          <p>everyone experiences slightly different</p>

          <p>challenges as well</p>

          <p>thank you got a few more things coming</p>

          <p>up on the chat</p>

          <p>um so uh in related to</p>

          <p>the um the previous question about</p>

          <p>um managers who think this is too</p>

          <p>political</p>

          <p>um Helen has said uh that her trust is</p>

          <p>very anxious to take this on and at</p>

          <p>every meeting and at every level we're</p>

          <p>being asked to</p>

          <p>consider Black Lives Matter I think it's</p>

          <p>less politically risky than it used to</p>

          <p>be</p>

          <p>so maybe it goes back to that point you</p>

          <p>mentioned uh right at the beginning Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>about or was it Natasha sorry about</p>

          <p>finding case studies from other</p>

          <p>organizations of what they're doing and</p>

          <p>why it's been so um</p>

          <p>uh good for their service</p>

          <p>yeah you don't have to reinvent the</p>

          <p>wheel there's</p>

          <p>lots of great practice going on out</p>

          <p>there</p>

          <p>and and uh um a a suggestion rather than</p>

          <p>a uh question um</p>

          <p>saying she's currently reading an</p>

          <p>excellent book she's learned a lot and</p>

          <p>she's only a few chapters in called why</p>

          <p>I’m not talking to white people about</p>

          <p>race by Reni Eddo-Lodge</p>

          <p>which I think is on</p>

          <p>your reading list is it not I believe</p>

          <p>it's on the reading list yeah</p>

          <p>yeah it is yeah we've got uh we've got</p>

          <p>that on our reading list and also a</p>

          <p>couple of others as well which</p>

          <p>are kind of if if you're interested in</p>

          <p>kind of continuing your reading journey</p>

          <p>around that</p>

          <p>and there's more stuff like that on</p>

          <p>there</p>

          <p>okay I can't see any more hands up</p>

          <p>apologies if I’ve missed you um and it</p>

          <p>is three o'clock now</p>

          <p>and there aren't any more questions on</p>

          <p>the chat</p>

          <p>so I think we will wrap this up if</p>

          <p>that's okay unless either of you want</p>

          <p>any more um comments before we go</p>

          <p>no I just thank everyone for joining in</p>

          <p>and engaging with us on this it's um</p>

          <p>piece um</p>

          <p>where we will talk about uh how health</p>

          <p>libraries should</p>

          <p>respond to other people perhaps within</p>

          <p>the protected characteristics so</p>

          <p>that would be interesting we'd be really</p>

          <p>interested to hear from you</p>

          <p>um and we will be publishing this</p>

          <p>webinar as a recording</p>

          <p>and its transcript our list of resources</p>

          <p>next few weeks so please keep an eye out</p>

          <p>appreciate is if when you receive your</p>

          <p>evaluation form please fill it in</p>

          <p>there'll be a section there for you to</p>

          <p>some actions to take away from today</p>

          <p>about the things that we can do going</p>

          <p>forward</p>

          <p>I'm going to allow um Natasha and Hong-Anh to introduce themselves um so that they can tell us about the work</p>

          <p>that they do and</p>

          <p>why they're involved in this um</p>

          <p>conversation</p>

          <p>okay um would you like me to go first</p>

          <p>holly</p>

          <p>please do it yeah okay so hI everyone so</p>

          <p>I’m Natasha Howard</p>

          <p>I’m library and knowledge services</p>

          <p>manager at NELFT north east london</p>

          <p>electric foundation trust</p>

          <p>um now I know many of you don't know me</p>

          <p>um some of you are dialing in so you</p>

          <p>can't see me</p>

          <p>I’m not black I’m mixed race or biracial</p>

          <p>so I’m roughly half</p>

          <p>black Afro Caribbean and half white</p>

          <p>english</p>

          <p>my mum was born in Jamaica and in the</p>

          <p>70s the government paid for her to come</p>

          <p>over here to change to be a nurse</p>

          <p>she did her training in Bath and then</p>

          <p>she went to Essex and did whisper training</p>

          <p>and that's where she met my dad so I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>always thought of myself as being half</p>

          <p>Essex half Jamaican</p>

          <p>I’m descended from enslaved people and</p>

          <p>to their enslavers</p>

          <p>but I’m not a spokesperson for black</p>

          <p>people that monolithic group that seems</p>

          <p>to exist in</p>

          <p>your imagination I want to be upfront</p>

          <p>about this because</p>

          <p>we all need to be able to acknowledge</p>

          <p>the privileges that we have</p>

          <p>and um I need to acknowledge the</p>

          <p>privilege the advantage that comes from</p>

          <p>having</p>

          <p>this lighter skin what some people call</p>

          <p>proximity to whiteness</p>

          <p>and it doesn't end there my other great</p>

          <p>privileges include a comfortable</p>

          <p>upbringing</p>

          <p>and fantastic education and we still</p>

          <p>have grammar schools in Essex and i</p>

          <p>passed my 11 plus I went to grammar</p>

          <p>school</p>

          <p>and then I went to King's College London</p>

          <p>now partly because of where I grew up</p>

          <p>and partly because I’m fortunate to have</p>

          <p>a wonderful extended uh family who are</p>

          <p>very loving I’ve never experienced the</p>

          <p>kind of overt</p>

          <p>violent um aggressive racism that many</p>

          <p>people would think of as being proper</p>

          <p>racist</p>

          <p>I’ve always known I was a target as a</p>

          <p>child my dad told me to be careful when</p>

          <p>we were in shops</p>

          <p>keep my hands visible because people</p>

          <p>would think I was going to shoplift</p>

          <p>because I’m brown</p>

          <p>even now if I go into a shop I always</p>

          <p>get a basket if I can't get a basket i</p>

          <p>walk around like this</p>

          <p>like I’m waiting on tables in my hands</p>

          <p>and I just don't even think about</p>

          <p>it when I was six my mom told me i'd</p>

          <p>have to work twice as hard as everyone</p>

          <p>else to get anywhere</p>

          <p>because of the colour of my skin at the</p>

          <p>time I really wasn't that bothered</p>

          <p>because I knew I was a hard worker</p>

          <p>and I was very bright so I just got on</p>

          <p>with it</p>

          <p>and for a long time I naively believed</p>

          <p>that we lived in a meritocracy and that</p>

          <p>part of hard work would pay off</p>

          <p>that our society was post-racial</p>

          <p>perhaps there was some pockets of</p>

          <p>ignorance</p>

          <p>that they are very isolated life started</p>

          <p>to change when my son was born six years</p>

          <p>ago</p>

          <p>he was two weeks early and we were kept</p>

          <p>on the postnatal ward so he could have</p>

          <p>iv antibiotics twice a day</p>

          <p>after we've been there for a few days i</p>

          <p>knew something wasn't right and I kept</p>

          <p>asking the right to midwives if he was</p>

          <p>okay</p>

          <p>they said he was fine his nappies were</p>

          <p>weird and</p>

          <p>they said they were normal it was only</p>

          <p>when it came to a weekend night shift</p>

          <p>and an Indian nurse was starting the</p>

          <p>neonatal unit and doing his iv</p>

          <p>antibiotics and she said to me</p>

          <p>your baby's a little bit jaundiced I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>taken a sample to check</p>

          <p>and a few hours later everything kicked</p>

          <p>off because the results showed that his</p>

          <p>he was really really jaundiced really</p>

          <p>dehydrated in a bad way</p>

          <p>but he was whisked off to the neonatal</p>

          <p>unit and it was nearly two weeks before</p>

          <p>I could take him home</p>

          <p>I was six years ago and he's fine now</p>

          <p>but that's just one example of how</p>

          <p>racism and health care affected outcomes</p>

          <p>the concerns of this very articulate</p>

          <p>educated women were repeatedly ignored</p>

          <p>and the white staff didn't know how to</p>

          <p>support children for non-white babies</p>

          <p>I guess I started to wake up to reality</p>

          <p>I started doing more reading so i</p>

          <p>realized that I had this duty to</p>

          <p>leverage my privilege to facilitate</p>

          <p>change</p>

          <p>but I have engaged with my trust's</p>

          <p>long-standing ethnic minority network</p>

          <p>and I’m now a interview colour rep for</p>

          <p>the network and also strategic</p>

          <p>ambassador</p>

          <p>like we know librarianship is &nbsp;white</p>

          <p>until our profession reflects the</p>

          <p>communities we serve we're not going to</p>

          <p>be equipped to meet their needs</p>

          <p>it's going to take a while to change</p>

          <p>those figures but I think in the</p>

          <p>meantime we all have a duty to</p>

          <p>participate ourselves on EDI</p>

          <p>issues in the broadest sense and how</p>

          <p>they manifest in our work</p>

          <p>and then we can start to act so thanks</p>

          <p>for taking the time to engage with us on</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>thanks Natasha um Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>are you there hold on</p>

          <p>she seems to have disappeared</p>

          <p>oh there you are ah sorry</p>

          <p>um I’m Hong-Anh Nguyen I am the library</p>

          <p>service manager at the kings fund</p>

          <p>so um I guess I work in a health library</p>

          <p>but</p>

          <p>probably not in uh the kind of way that</p>

          <p>most people think about health libraries</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>our collection is focused on health</p>

          <p>and social care policy and management</p>

          <p>and so um like Natasha said and so eloquently said</p>

          <p>um I think one of the things that is</p>

          <p>really important for</p>

          <p>me to clock in my introduction is that</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>this session is about black lives</p>

          <p>matter and</p>

          <p>as you can see I’m not black I am i</p>

          <p>would identify as a woman of colour</p>

          <p>person of colour BAME all of those are</p>

          <p>like words that I might use to describe</p>

          <p>myself just depending on</p>

          <p>the context or southeast Asian or</p>

          <p>Vietnamese</p>

          <p>um and the</p>

          <p>kind of experiences of</p>

          <p>discrimination or othering that I</p>

          <p>experienced</p>

          <p>are very different to the experiences</p>

          <p>of um Black or Asian</p>

          <p>or other ethnic minority people um</p>

          <p>I think it's just really important to</p>

          <p>kind of highlight</p>

          <p>that because um I think what black lives</p>

          <p>matter is really highlighted is that</p>

          <p>BAME isn't like a monolith</p>

          <p>it's an umbrella term that kind of</p>

          <p>covers a lot of experiences</p>

          <p>and for me how that showed up in my life</p>

          <p>is that um</p>

          <p>the southeast Asian community tends to</p>

          <p>be kind of part of what</p>

          <p>we call in this country like the model</p>

          <p>model minority</p>

          <p>um you might have also heard it referred</p>

          <p>to as like the good immigrant</p>

          <p>um as there is this kind of ex</p>

          <p>it kind of shows up as like an</p>

          <p>expectation that uh</p>

          <p>you're going to kind of be very perform</p>

          <p>really</p>

          <p>well academically that you will go into</p>

          <p>certain</p>

          <p>professions so like being a doctor or</p>

          <p>being a pharmacist</p>

          <p>or being a lawyer um</p>

          <p>and I think it's it's about uh</p>

          <p>kind of putting that identity in a box</p>

          <p>and making expectations</p>

          <p>of how they perform but when</p>

          <p>Black Lives Matter um when it kind of</p>

          <p>came to the attention of the world again</p>

          <p>over the past few weeks one of the</p>

          <p>things that really</p>

          <p>that I really kind of thought that was</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>the way that model minorities are used</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>as a tool of white supremacy like as a</p>

          <p>way</p>

          <p>to kind of um</p>

          <p>yes as a way to kind of oppress like</p>

          <p>other</p>

          <p>minority groups um so</p>

          <p>again there is like layers of privilege</p>

          <p>there that we have to think about</p>

          <p>um I guess the other thing I want to say</p>

          <p>is that my experience</p>

          <p>of talking and thinking and doing stuff</p>

          <p>around</p>

          <p>equality diversity and inclusion it's</p>

          <p>it's informed by my lived experience but</p>

          <p>it's really garnered from my</p>

          <p>professional experience so I’m involved</p>

          <p>in a lot of</p>

          <p>the king's funds uh diversity inclusion</p>

          <p>program</p>

          <p>and so I co-lead on a lot of the work</p>

          <p>that we do</p>

          <p>and I’m involved in lots of the</p>

          <p>initiatives so I’m part of the reverse</p>

          <p>mentoring program</p>

          <p>and uh I we introduced um</p>

          <p>a a positive action graduate trainee</p>

          <p>post</p>

          <p>for example so yes so um</p>

          <p>I guess I guess my disclaimer as it were</p>

          <p>would be that</p>

          <p>um and I’m sure Natasha would agree with</p>

          <p>this is</p>

          <p>that while we have experience in this</p>

          <p>field uh we don't have all the answers</p>

          <p>um there is no silver bullet for solving</p>

          <p>the issues that we're going to be</p>

          <p>talking about because if there were</p>

          <p>we wouldn't be having this discussion</p>

          <p>today so I think it's more to say that</p>

          <p>we're just sharing our experiences of</p>

          <p>how</p>

          <p>our journey has been so far in working</p>

          <p>in this area</p>

          <p>thank you that's great so um</p>

          <p>what we've done is we've taken the</p>

          <p>questions that you all are</p>

          <p>on slido and we've sort of grouped them</p>

          <p>together thematically because there were</p>

          <p>quite a lot</p>

          <p>of questions that um went together</p>

          <p>nicely so I’m going to ask Natasha and</p>

          <p>Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>these questions and then they're going</p>

          <p>to have a discussion and during that</p>

          <p>discussion if you want to make any</p>

          <p>further questions or comments please use</p>

          <p>the chat function</p>

          <p>so let's kick off with our first</p>

          <p>question how can library staff</p>

          <p>regardless of level or role</p>

          <p>affect positive change and influence</p>

          <p>upwards where resistance is being met</p>

          <p>tricky isn't it, this is a really good</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>and I’m sure one that both of us really</p>

          <p>relate to in our experience so far</p>

          <p>um I guess so I I guess</p>

          <p>resistance is often felt</p>

          <p>um downwards but resistance can be found</p>

          <p>in like</p>

          <p>all directions within an organization so</p>

          <p>it can be felt from your peers</p>

          <p>it can be felt from your managers from</p>

          <p>directors senior managers um</p>

          <p>so what I always think is that everyone</p>

          <p>is responsible for something right you</p>

          <p>you all have a job description you're</p>

          <p>all responsible for</p>

          <p>delivering an element or aspect of your</p>

          <p>service making certain decisions about</p>

          <p>your service</p>

          <p>that is power um so you have the power</p>

          <p>to make decisions</p>

          <p>that ultimately add up into</p>

          <p>change um if everyone kind of thinks</p>

          <p>about their power consciously so</p>

          <p>if if you're a cataloguer for example</p>

          <p>you might have the ability to kind of</p>

          <p>lead a discussion and lead a piece of</p>

          <p>thinking about</p>

          <p>do the class do the indexing terms we</p>

          <p>use reflect</p>

          <p>really um the languages used nowadays</p>

          <p>um around gender identity</p>

          <p>around race um</p>

          <p>you know that's that's one thing that</p>

          <p>you can do you can't do everything</p>

          <p>but the things that you can do are</p>

          <p>change</p>

          <p>um so that would be my first thought on</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>Natasha what do you think</p>

          <p>yeah I think some different examples</p>

          <p>I’ve seen of training sessions as well</p>

          <p>if you're helping people learn to search</p>

          <p>databases you can use examples that</p>

          <p>speak to</p>

          <p>different aspects whether they're things</p>

          <p>to do with race</p>

          <p>or things to do with issues like um</p>

          <p>domestic violence and that kind of thing</p>

          <p>and so just even from including those</p>

          <p>examples when you're saying</p>

          <p>people it's just starting to broaden out</p>

          <p>the thinking a little bit more</p>

          <p>um the other one</p>

          <p>um I was thinking of is about sharing</p>

          <p>good practice from elsewhere</p>

          <p>like maybe your boss doesn't want to do</p>

          <p>it but there's nothing to stop you</p>

          <p>talking about</p>

          <p>what everyone else is doing or what</p>

          <p>someone else is doing</p>

          <p>and you know if it gets talked about</p>

          <p>enough um</p>

          <p>there will be um there will be that</p>

          <p>pressure to do something</p>

          <p>yeah and also I mean particularly for</p>

          <p>the nhs</p>

          <p>there's an aspect of um accountability</p>

          <p>as well so</p>

          <p>you know you've got the workforce race</p>

          <p>equality standard</p>

          <p>um which which are the measures that um</p>

          <p>that you know are applied nationally</p>

          <p>across the service in terms of measuring</p>

          <p>uh race disparity in the nhs and</p>

          <p>um that's not so there are kind of</p>

          <p>things that the nhs is required to do</p>

          <p>standards that they require to meet</p>

          <p>and so is there any way that you can</p>

          <p>kind of train your argument</p>

          <p>in terms of like this link to a</p>

          <p>strategic priority</p>

          <p>it might lead to a strategic equality in</p>

          <p>the nhs so you might link it to race</p>

          <p>data this is particularly personal when</p>

          <p>you're thinking about</p>

          <p>on workforce like when you're thinking</p>

          <p>about the makeup of your team</p>

          <p>um how people progress how you support</p>

          <p>career</p>

          <p>progression because the nhs is actually</p>

          <p>quite diverse but as you</p>

          <p>as you travel up that diversity doesn't</p>

          <p>translate in terms of race</p>

          <p>um and you know there are also kind of</p>

          <p>strategic priorities that your</p>

          <p>organization will have that your trust</p>

          <p>will have</p>

          <p>your trust will have I’m I’m pretty sure</p>

          <p>that all nhs trusts will have like</p>

          <p>some sort of EDI strategic objectives</p>

          <p>um and what what are those how can you</p>

          <p>kind of link it into those</p>

          <p>like you need to think about all of</p>

          <p>those things to kind of help make the</p>

          <p>business case</p>

          <p>almost um you kind of have to treat</p>

          <p>everything like it's a business case</p>

          <p>because the moral code alone sometimes</p>

          <p>won't win the day so sometimes you have</p>

          <p>to</p>

          <p>you have to put your librarian and do a</p>

          <p>bit of research and say here's the data</p>

          <p>this is why we should do it so</p>

          <p>um there's lots of data out there for</p>

          <p>example about why um</p>

          <p>not diversifying your workforce will</p>

          <p>result in um you know</p>

          <p>less a less rich pool of talent and then</p>

          <p>that has an economic impact on your</p>

          <p>organization</p>

          <p>you need to kind of yeah put your</p>

          <p>research hat on</p>

          <p>and and find what the what the kind of</p>

          <p>data is and what the argument is</p>

          <p>to do this kind of thing whatever the</p>

          <p>change is</p>

          <p>another one I was going to suggest is um</p>

          <p>about</p>

          <p>if you just have an ethnic minority or a</p>

          <p>black staff network</p>

          <p>it might be useful to link in with them</p>

          <p>because as Hong-Anh says</p>

          <p>there's strategic priorities around</p>

          <p>these issues you know if you're chair of</p>

          <p>your</p>

          <p>same network is saying where's the edi</p>

          <p>stuff in the library</p>

          <p>that's going to perhaps carry a bit more</p>

          <p>weight then and you sending it to</p>

          <p>your boss maybe yeah that's a really</p>

          <p>good shout out</p>

          <p>definitely yeah find yours what is your</p>

          <p>um peers in your organization find your</p>

          <p>supporters</p>

          <p>like you're trying to do things that</p>

          <p>you're just more distant</p>

          <p>you're not the only one who's trying to</p>

          <p>make this change so you need to try and</p>

          <p>find the other people and join up</p>

          <p>um and be strategic about it yeah</p>

          <p>so if for example you want to kind of</p>

          <p>diversify your collection</p>

          <p>um but you know there are budget</p>

          <p>constraints and there's a bit of</p>

          <p>resistance</p>

          <p>about it can you argue that it's good</p>

          <p>for self well-being can you argue that</p>

          <p>it links into kind of</p>

          <p>like greater thinking around health</p>

          <p>inequalities and how that interacts with</p>

          <p>race inequality</p>

          <p>and that's actually quite an important</p>

          <p>dimension to speak about because</p>

          <p>at a health policy level that's</p>

          <p>something that people are starting to</p>

          <p>think about you know</p>

          <p>you need to kind of cast your net</p>

          <p>quite broadly</p>

          <p>that's great I think that's that's a lot</p>

          <p>of practical</p>

          <p>steps that people can take to start</p>

          <p>thinking about how they</p>

          <p>affect that positive change upwards</p>

          <p>um I don't think we've got anything</p>

          <p>that's come from on the chat on that</p>

          <p>topic so she'll move on to our next</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>yeah yeah</p>

          <p>so and this has been a big one we had</p>

          <p>lots of um discussion about this on on</p>

          <p>slido what does it mean to decolonize a</p>

          <p>library in a healthcare</p>

          <p>context okay</p>

          <p>so um decolonization</p>

          <p>as I understand it is about sort of um</p>

          <p>changing the focus from</p>

          <p>um things that have been largely built</p>

          <p>and designed around</p>

          <p>cisgender white specific male</p>

          <p>white people and making things</p>

          <p>yeah more diverse so in</p>

          <p>our health care library I think there's</p>

          <p>lots of ways that we can do it</p>

          <p>um we can talk about collections but</p>

          <p>we've also talked about the training</p>

          <p>aspects as well uh raising awareness</p>

          <p>to those kind of examples um</p>

          <p>and yeah the um things that we've got</p>

          <p>over about the</p>

          <p>lack of diversity of images and stuff</p>

          <p>that's really topical at the moment I</p>

          <p>don't know people have seen on twitter</p>

          <p>there is a student at saint george's</p>

          <p>uh university who has um</p>

          <p>written a book about recognizing</p>

          <p>clinical signs in black and brown skin</p>

          <p>he's done it as part of a student</p>

          <p>project he's a medical student</p>

          <p>and this is being hailed as a big thing</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>it's a first over</p>

          <p>and that's kind of incredible when you</p>

          <p>think about it but</p>

          <p>this should be down to the unpaid labour</p>

          <p>of a</p>

          <p>medical student to reduce this kind of</p>

          <p>resource</p>

          <p>but these are the kind of things that</p>

          <p>we're thinking of um</p>

          <p>these pictures these resources should be</p>

          <p>more available</p>

          <p>and when we say decolonized we're not</p>

          <p>just talking about the race agenda we're</p>

          <p>talking about um</p>

          <p>gender we're talking about um lgbtq+</p>

          <p>issues as well</p>

          <p>and um which have a knock-on effect in</p>

          <p>health</p>

          <p>and health outcomes so it's really</p>

          <p>thinking wisely</p>

          <p>uh interrogating our collections what</p>

          <p>voices are being heard</p>

          <p>what voices aren't being heard and</p>

          <p>in the collections and in the terms that</p>

          <p>we use as Hong-Anh said earlier the index</p>

          <p>terms that we use as well</p>

          <p>yeah I think the example that you use of</p>

          <p>the um</p>

          <p>uh the medical students who've put</p>

          <p>together this resource I mean</p>

          <p>uh that absolutely shouldn't be</p>

          <p>something that someone has taken on as</p>

          <p>unpaid labour</p>

          <p>um and I guess my my challenge to us as</p>

          <p>the profession is as a profession we</p>

          <p>have significant economic power um when</p>

          <p>it comes to publishers for example what</p>

          <p>could we do to affect change</p>

          <p>as a whole profession of health care</p>

          <p>librarians when we're thinking about</p>

          <p>um what what's missing um</p>

          <p>so we know that in dermatology yeah like</p>

          <p>there are</p>

          <p>there are no uh there's no diversity</p>

          <p>in how skin conditions show up on</p>

          <p>different colour skins because they do</p>

          <p>present differently</p>

          <p>um a really pertinent example of this at</p>

          <p>the moment is um in Covid actually</p>

          <p>so one of the symptoms of clothing is a</p>

          <p>rash</p>

          <p>about 20% of covid patients present with</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>um but all the exams like the majority</p>

          <p>of the examples</p>

          <p>uh photographic examples we have of how this rash looks is on white skin</p>

          <p>and there are very little examples</p>

          <p>photographic examples of how this looks</p>

          <p>on</p>

          <p>Asian skin on Black skin um and so it</p>

          <p>looks different and this might be a</p>

          <p>crucial thing that is being missed</p>

          <p>in a certain section of population and</p>

          <p>we already know that</p>

          <p>outcomes and covid for um particular</p>

          <p>ethnic groups</p>

          <p>is very different um than it is in white</p>

          <p>groups so</p>

          <p>um actually the um the cover tracking</p>

          <p>app that</p>

          <p>um is uh developed by zoe is the one</p>

          <p>that's been used quite a lot in the uk</p>

          <p>at the moment I’m sure</p>

          <p>a lot of people on this call um can</p>

          <p>say they're every day on it</p>

          <p>and they put out a call for people to um</p>

          <p>send in pictures if</p>

          <p>if they had experienced the rash and um</p>

          <p>you know</p>

          <p>uh weren't from um a caucasian</p>

          <p>background</p>

          <p>um and so we could have examples of that</p>

          <p>so</p>

          <p>um so yeah it has kind of real world</p>

          <p>consequences this kind of stuff</p>

          <p>um and what Natasha said as well about</p>

          <p>it applying to kind of other</p>

          <p>characteristics as well so</p>

          <p>for anyone who's read like the Caroline</p>

          <p>Criado-Perez Invisible Women</p>

          <p>there's quite a lot there about how um</p>

          <p>medical research has historically</p>

          <p>erased women from a lot of trials</p>

          <p>um and consequently our understanding</p>

          <p>our medical model of understanding some</p>

          <p>conditions is based on how it presents</p>

          <p>in men for example so</p>

          <p>um so again it's about that kind of real</p>

          <p>world consequence so I think</p>

          <p>for us as um</p>

          <p>as healthcare librarians as information</p>

          <p>professionals we need to</p>

          <p>get ahead of a curve right we need to</p>

          <p>understand where the gaps in our</p>

          <p>knowledge are</p>

          <p>and be conscious of that and think think</p>

          <p>about that bear that in mind when we</p>

          <p>carry out literature searches when we</p>

          <p>think about our collections</p>

          <p>and you know that's on our speed</p>

          <p>that's great thank you we've actually</p>

          <p>had some a really good question</p>

          <p>um um Shakira has uh shared the</p>

          <p>information on the mind the gap book</p>

          <p>that you were talking about from</p>

          <p>Saint George's if you were interested in</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>we can add that link into our resources</p>

          <p>list actually can't we</p>

          <p>yeah lovely thank you that would be</p>

          <p>great so</p>

          <p>um Camilla has asked uh when we do</p>

          <p>literature searches on eg dermatological</p>

          <p>conditions and darker skin</p>

          <p>sometimes it seems that there is very</p>

          <p>little research or no research</p>

          <p>is there an organization or somewhere we</p>

          <p>can report these research gaps to</p>

          <p>somewhere that is able to pass on the</p>

          <p>message that most research is needed on</p>

          <p>x y and z, wow that's, if</p>

          <p>there is a place yes great question we</p>

          <p>we should try and find out I wonder if</p>

          <p>they're in</p>

          <p>yeah I wonder if nihr is a good place</p>

          <p>to report that so that's the national</p>

          <p>institute for health research they're</p>

          <p>the main funding body</p>

          <p>for nhs research and they give out grants</p>

          <p>for research conducted in the nhs</p>

          <p>and I think one of their remits is to</p>

          <p>try and correct like gaps in the</p>

          <p>knowledge</p>

          <p>in the evidence so um that might be one</p>

          <p>that comes to mind but that's definitely</p>

          <p>something we should go away and look at</p>

          <p>and we might add that to the reading</p>

          <p>list</p>

          <p>I’m wondering if if if some of these</p>

          <p>like some more</p>

          <p>say like Runnymede Trust or whatever</p>

          <p>might have some ideas as well</p>

          <p>yeah some other like that it's a think</p>

          <p>tank isn't it so um</p>

          <p>yeah yeah yeah that's a really good</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>with action to take away yeah and they’re</p>

          <p>really well placed to kind of spot that</p>

          <p>kind of thing and report it</p>

          <p>sorry just flicking back and forth</p>

          <p>through the chat and I’m using myself</p>

          <p>there's been another um uh suggestion</p>

          <p>here from Suzanne Wilson she says the</p>

          <p>James Lind alliance</p>

          <p>and she's put the link in which we will</p>

          <p>add to our resources pack thank you</p>

          <p>susanne that's really</p>

          <p>okay should we move on to our next</p>

          <p>question</p>

          <p>so how can libraries promote their edi</p>

          <p>collections and encourage engagement</p>

          <p>with this topic through the resources</p>

          <p>that they provide</p>

          <p>so this is a great question um</p>

          <p>and I think you know um</p>

          <p>I don't think it's a case of doing</p>

          <p>anything extra</p>

          <p>over and above what you already do in</p>

          <p>your services</p>

          <p>and in the services that you provide</p>

          <p>it's about rethinking all of those</p>

          <p>activities you do</p>

          <p>with a different lens thinking about it</p>

          <p>through the edi</p>

          <p>the edi lens um and so like Natasha's</p>

          <p>already given a great example of this</p>

          <p>in terms of like things about training</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>you know like could you if you host a</p>

          <p>journal club for example</p>

          <p>um could you use that journal club model</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>use it to host discussions around</p>

          <p>diversity where you</p>

          <p>um you could use not only like</p>

          <p>clinical uh like clinical research but</p>

          <p>you could use maybe like um</p>

          <p>a think piece that is about an aspect of</p>

          <p>uh diversity and inclusion that you</p>

          <p>think it's really useful to have a</p>

          <p>conversation about</p>

          <p>um and so you give people that reading</p>

          <p>and then it's up to you you have the</p>

          <p>physical space and you can kind of host</p>

          <p>the space to have that discussion</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>uh one that kind of provides</p>

          <p>lifelong learning continuous learning</p>

          <p>opportunities which is</p>

          <p>you know that's our jam that's what we</p>

          <p>do um</p>

          <p>and it's it's continuing to engage um</p>

          <p>people with your servers who may maybe</p>

          <p>they don't need to use the library</p>

          <p>in their day-to-day job but this is like</p>

          <p>again proving that</p>

          <p>this the service library can be relevant</p>

          <p>to their professional development</p>

          <p>in a different way</p>

          <p>yep yes I really like that um that</p>

          <p>lifelong learning idea and I think that</p>

          <p>some of the questions</p>

          <p>specifically about black history month</p>

          <p>and stuff I think sometimes we sort of</p>

          <p>think oh you know</p>

          <p>Black History Month or five months is it</p>

          <p>really relevant to what we're doing well</p>

          <p>actually</p>

          <p>I think these are things that many of us</p>

          <p>need to learn more about and it will</p>

          <p>benefit us not just in our work but in</p>

          <p>our</p>

          <p>home lives as well so I think it's a</p>

          <p>really good opportunity to</p>

          <p>have those conversations and also you</p>

          <p>know</p>

          <p>it can be fun as well it doesn't have to</p>

          <p>be really serious you know</p>

          <p>the one about activity ideas for Black</p>

          <p>History Month well yeah you could get</p>

          <p>people to read that you could also get</p>

          <p>people to watch a film</p>

          <p>you know a podcast uh that kind of thing</p>

          <p>um and have a</p>

          <p>comedy sketch even and have a discussion</p>

          <p>about it so</p>

          <p>um yeah yeah yeah and that's a great</p>

          <p>point about like yeah it doesn't</p>

          <p>it doesn't have to be po faced so um</p>

          <p>we had pride week at the fund recently</p>

          <p>and one thing we did was</p>

          <p>to host a quiz um but the quiz was an</p>

          <p>educational quiz so</p>

          <p>all the questions were centered around</p>

          <p>um lgbt history</p>

          <p>um so it was educational as well as</p>

          <p>being a social activity</p>

          <p>one of the questions about encouraging</p>

          <p>engagement and encouraging people to</p>

          <p>join in one of the phrases that our</p>

          <p>ethnic minority network</p>

          <p>uses is um remember opening events out</p>

          <p>to everybody</p>

          <p>we did this yesterday um they said we</p>

          <p>would like attendance to reflect the</p>

          <p>makeup</p>

          <p>of the organization so we want sixty</p>

          <p>percent white staff forty percent</p>

          <p>BAME and they pretty much got it</p>

          <p>um pretty much the stats debate they</p>

          <p>were doing a slider on it um</p>

          <p>yeah so I think I think sometimes</p>

          <p>people think things aren't for them so</p>

          <p>you have to and that's something we're</p>

          <p>doing in the recruitment isn't it you</p>

          <p>know making it obvious we want</p>

          <p>applications from underrepresented</p>

          <p>groups</p>

          <p>we're saying for these kind of</p>

          <p>activities as well</p>

          <p>yeah yeah and I think that's that's a</p>

          <p>really good point Natasha is that um</p>

          <p>often like edi stuff can kind of</p>

          <p>attract a certain crowd and it can</p>

          <p>either attract people who</p>

          <p>you know um they're attracted to it</p>

          <p>because it reflects</p>

          <p>their lived experience and so you know</p>

          <p>if they people want to get involved</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>it is really about directly influencing</p>

          <p>change to make</p>

          <p>their own experience of the workplace</p>

          <p>better um</p>

          <p>or it can be people who are kind of um</p>

          <p>you know really allied to the cause and</p>

          <p>quite active and</p>

          <p>um already quite active uh in that space</p>

          <p>um and I think for people who are newer</p>

          <p>to the conversation it can feel</p>

          <p>um it can feel scary to join that</p>

          <p>and when there's there might be a gap in</p>

          <p>where they are on their journey and</p>

          <p>where other people are on their journey</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>you know often people don't want to get</p>

          <p>involved in stuff like this because</p>

          <p>they're scared of saying the wrong thing</p>

          <p>or they're scared that it's not a space</p>

          <p>for them so being really explicit about</p>

          <p>what we expect</p>

          <p>is really important and saying you know</p>

          <p>we expect everyone to get involved in</p>

          <p>this because this is a problem</p>

          <p>not only for um black and brown people to solve</p>

          <p>it's a problem for everyone to solve</p>

          <p>I think that fits in really well to</p>

          <p>another question we have that is on</p>

          <p>the slide around</p>

          <p>um being an ally so somebody had</p>

          <p>recently taken part in ally training</p>

          <p>provided by the trust lgbtq plus network</p>

          <p>and they wondered what your thoughts</p>

          <p>were on staff becoming an ally</p>

          <p>oh that's really um that's really timely</p>

          <p>question because we um the call I was</p>

          <p>talking about just now was brought out of the lgbt+ network and allies</p>

          <p>and um I think it can be</p>

          <p>really powerful um as long as we're</p>

          <p>clear on what the ask is and one of&nbsp;</p>

          <p>the slides we had on the call</p>

          <p>yesterday was</p>

          <p>what an ally is not what you mustn’t do and</p>

          <p>then they were giving and then there was</p>

          <p>another slightly different thing to do</p>

          <p>um and and I’ve heard this from our</p>

          <p>lgbtq</p>

          <p>network um when they launched their</p>

          <p>allies scheme they gave everybody this</p>

          <p>nice little badge</p>

          <p>and they've sort of thrown there a few</p>

          <p>months long it's not just about the</p>

          <p>badge we actually need people to</p>

          <p>do stuff so one good thing on our call</p>

          <p>yesterday if we had all our senior</p>

          <p>integrated care directors</p>

          <p>and our chief executives even making</p>

          <p>pledges about things that they are going</p>

          <p>to do</p>

          <p>to demonstrate that allyship and so</p>

          <p>they're going to be held accountable</p>

          <p>by the network by the organization for</p>

          <p>the things they said on the</p>

          <p>or on the call yesterday um one thing</p>

          <p>we haven't got on the reading list that</p>

          <p>we should add um</p>

          <p>Yvonne Coghill um who was</p>

          <p>with the red team I’m not sure if she</p>

          <p>still is but she's still obviously</p>

          <p>operating this area she just did a seven</p>

          <p>days of allyship</p>

          <p>slide thing that's been going around on</p>

          <p>twitter that was really good it's just</p>

          <p>on one page</p>

          <p>um we should add that to the reading</p>

          <p>list</p>

          <p>yeah actions yeah yeah and I think you</p>

          <p>know</p>

          <p>um I think the key for the key thing for</p>

          <p>me in terms of allyship is that you need</p>

          <p>to be active</p>

          <p>at my ship um allyship to kind of signal</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>you're for the cause is great but we</p>

          <p>need to go one further</p>

          <p>we we need we need white people to step</p>

          <p>up</p>

          <p>and actually help us push this boulder</p>

          <p>up the hill because</p>

          <p>um if it's only people from an ethnic</p>

          <p>minority background pushing that boulder</p>

          <p>up the hill then</p>

          <p>you know if you think about it you're</p>

          <p>perpetuating the same problem it's</p>

          <p>it's unpaid labour it's work on an</p>

          <p>underrepresented group to fix the</p>

          <p>problems that have been</p>

          <p>created by a dominant group so um</p>

          <p>allyship can look like a lot of</p>

          <p>different things yeah it can look like</p>

          <p>personal commitment</p>

          <p>it can look like um</p>

          <p>you know being the person to take on the</p>

          <p>difficult conversation</p>

          <p>so that your colleague from an ethnic</p>

          <p>minority background doesn't have to</p>

          <p>if someone has said something in a</p>

          <p>meeting that you know doesn't sit well</p>

          <p>with you</p>

          <p>maybe maybe that's like a really great</p>

          <p>thing you can do is to kind of</p>

          <p>call that out um so that it's it's less</p>

          <p>of a fraught conversation for the person</p>

          <p>who</p>

          <p>has the least power in that situation um</p>

          <p>yeah so it's just about thinking about</p>

          <p>what you can do</p>

          <p>um one of the questions on the slide</p>

          <p>uh is about you know are they good</p>

          <p>examples of um</p>

          <p>trust implementing training where people</p>

          <p>can feel the lived experiences of stuff</p>

          <p>I say another kind of really important</p>

          <p>thing you can do as an ally is</p>

          <p>to not rely on people</p>

          <p>having to kind of mine some of their</p>

          <p>traumatic experiences so that you can</p>

          <p>learn</p>

          <p>there's a lot out there already um you</p>

          <p>know there are people there are talented</p>

          <p>authors podcasters</p>

          <p>screenwriters actors who have all kind</p>

          <p>of</p>

          <p>um created stuff that help you</p>

          <p>understand what that lived experience is</p>

          <p>like</p>

          <p>um it's a tough ask to ask your</p>

          <p>colleagues</p>

          <p>to share that because it can be risky</p>

          <p>you know like</p>

          <p>if um if you experience the workplace in</p>

          <p>a different way and then you're being</p>

          <p>asked to kind of</p>

          <p>disclose how different that is and how</p>

          <p>bad that is for you</p>

          <p>that's a really tough place to be put in</p>

          <p>um and just to say yeah one thing that</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>I’ve added to the reading list is that</p>

          <p>the King’s Trust have recently</p>

          <p>published a piece of research which</p>

          <p>includes some</p>

          <p>data of that ilk that is anonymized so</p>

          <p>that helps give you a flavour but there</p>

          <p>is</p>

          <p>plenty out there that's written on this</p>

          <p>and specifically in the nhs context as</p>

          <p>well</p>

          <p>just a couple of things out there Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>yeah we shouldn't be asking our</p>

          <p>colleagues to</p>

          <p>to relive their horrible experiences but</p>

          <p>if you're going to pay somebody who does</p>

          <p>this for a living to</p>

          <p>you know facilitate those conversations</p>

          <p>or just um</p>

          <p>uh interpret that for you then there are</p>

          <p>several good people out there who can</p>

          <p>have those conversations</p>

          <p>and and take that um because they're</p>

          <p>paid to do it</p>

          <p>rather than your staff having to do it</p>

          <p>the other one is um</p>

          <p>I just recently came across and it's on</p>

          <p>the reading list um this thing called</p>

          <p>hexitime I don't know if people have</p>

          <p>seen it</p>

          <p>it's uh like a time banking thing and</p>

          <p>they have running a campaign about</p>

          <p>supporting BAME colleagues because</p>

          <p>several of my um several of my white</p>

          <p>mostly male colleagues have signed up</p>

          <p>for that this week</p>

          <p>that offered to do things like interview</p>

          <p>coaching um and mentoring</p>

          <p>for um more junior um</p>

          <p>new qualified allied health</p>

          <p>professionals for example so</p>

          <p>that might be something you think you</p>

          <p>that you could do and I'll also be</p>

          <p>outside your work as well</p>

          <p>you know um actually um I’m so nobody</p>

          <p>can stop you from doing it if you want</p>

          <p>to offer a mentor</p>

          <p>or give interview and practice for</p>

          <p>somebody</p>

          <p>thank you I think um I think you've kind</p>

          <p>of gone into some of these</p>

          <p>examples that this next question has</p>

          <p>asked but um</p>

          <p>Richard has said what does it</p>

          <p>mean to help as an old white middle</p>

          <p>class guy I’m aware</p>

          <p>I don't want to patronize or mansplain</p>

          <p>to people what concrete things can I do</p>

          <p>I think the fact that you know the word</p>

          <p>mansplain means that you're probably</p>

          <p>you're on the right lines there</p>

          <p>I that I always appreciate when my older</p>

          <p>white colleagues do that is um when they</p>

          <p>say my name when I’m not there</p>

          <p>or when they reference work that I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>done when I will bring me into a</p>

          <p>conversation about something I can help</p>

          <p>with</p>

          <p>that there's people you can do that for</p>

          <p>yeah um like I said before you can be</p>

          <p>the person to have a difficult</p>

          <p>conversation too</p>

          <p>so harking back to one of the earlier</p>

          <p>questions about resistance</p>

          <p>if um people are trying to make change</p>

          <p>um about something chances are that um</p>

          <p>as a white</p>

          <p>white man people might listen to you</p>

          <p>more than they do to other people</p>

          <p>um than they do to a woman of colour so</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>you know you're you're you can utilize</p>

          <p>your privilege for good</p>

          <p>thanks that was great okay so</p>

          <p>this is a big topic as well actually it</p>

          <p>came up what should library collections</p>

          <p>relating to</p>

          <p>equality diversity and inclusion or BAME</p>

          <p>groups be called what language would be</p>

          <p>most appropriate and least offensive</p>

          <p>so we've put some stuff on the reading</p>

          <p>list about the different terms haven't</p>

          <p>we Hong-Anh because there's</p>

          <p>there's a lot to unpick with them</p>

          <p>yeah there is um we've actually been</p>

          <p>having this conversation quite a lot</p>

          <p>at fund recently um</p>

          <p>partially I think because we've realized</p>

          <p>that</p>

          <p>one of the reasons why we what the</p>

          <p>consequence of us</p>

          <p>having historically not done that much</p>

          <p>work about it is that we don't have the</p>

          <p>confidence to talk about it because we</p>

          <p>feel like we don't have the language and</p>

          <p>language is so often a barrier in terms</p>

          <p>of people trying to get involved in this</p>

          <p>because</p>

          <p>people don't want to offend um</p>

          <p><br />
          so like I think the key thing here is</p>

          <p>that there is</p>

          <p>this is not going to be very helpful but</p>

          <p>there is no right or wrong</p>

          <p>so I’m fine with the term BAME being</p>

          <p>used</p>

          <p>other people aren't I’m okay with it</p>

          <p>being used in certain contexts</p>

          <p>so I think it's I think where you use</p>

          <p>terms you have to use them meaningfully</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>ensure that you've put some thought into</p>

          <p>it so</p>

          <p>BAME is okay if what you mean is</p>

          <p>actually</p>

          <p>Black Asian and Ethnic Minority bame is</p>

          <p>not okay if you are only referring to a</p>

          <p>few of those groups for example</p>

          <p>um I I think</p>

          <p>language is loaded and it just means</p>

          <p>that um</p>

          <p>it means something different to everyone</p>

          <p>else so</p>

          <p>I think as long as you make the decision</p>

          <p>and you've done your research</p>

          <p>research and you're able to say why</p>

          <p>you've made that decision</p>

          <p>that is that is the best approach to</p>

          <p>this</p>

          <p>so an example is um at the fund we uh</p>

          <p>used</p>

          <p>capital b for Black and we had a</p>

          <p>discussion about what that why that</p>

          <p>is and um because you know Black is not</p>

          <p>it's not an ethnicity but there is um</p>

          <p>a political dimension to it in terms of</p>

          <p>it's</p>

          <p>you know it's a social construct um that</p>

          <p>is recognized so</p>

          <p>it is used with capital b but</p>

          <p>there's also discussion about whether</p>

          <p>you should also capitalise the w</p>

          <p>in white um and the capital w and white</p>

          <p>is sometimes associated with</p>

          <p>white supremacy but then also if you</p>

          <p>don't capitalize it then</p>

          <p>it plays into that whole thing of like</p>

          <p>uh white people not recognizing that</p>

          <p>they are also holders of race</p>

          <p>races not only held by people who aren't</p>

          <p>white</p>

          <p>so it's really complex and messy but</p>

          <p>just do your research and and figure out</p>

          <p>where you fall</p>

          <p>on it and why you've made those</p>

          <p>decisions so that if you get called out</p>

          <p>on it if people want to know why you've</p>

          <p>made that decision you can have a</p>

          <p>meaningful conversation about it</p>

          <p>thank you I don't know Natasha do you</p>

          <p>have anything to add to that</p>

          <p>no I suppose I might just say something</p>

          <p>about um</p>

          <p>a question saying about collections</p>

          <p>related to edI or BAME groups and i</p>

          <p>think I like the idea more of having an</p>

          <p>edi</p>

          <p>collection because you know we're</p>

          <p>thinking about this holistically</p>

          <p>everything about all</p>

          <p>trying to think about all the detective</p>

          <p>characteristics</p>

          <p>and it would be nice to make sure you</p>

          <p>have stuff covering all of those</p>

          <p>different label groups as well and i</p>

          <p>don't know maybe it depends on how big</p>

          <p>your collection is maybe</p>

          <p>I don't think i'd have enough to have</p>

          <p>separate reading this drawer</p>

          <p>okay so maybe you've gone</p>

          <p>I think that's a really good point as</p>

          <p>well because it takes into that idea of</p>

          <p>intersectionality as well so you know</p>

          <p>we should be thinking about all the</p>

          <p>characteristics and all these different</p>

          <p>characteristics don't sit in silos</p>

          <p>um you know so um it's really important</p>

          <p>to yeah</p>

          <p>think about it holistically</p>

          <p>fab right we have some chats going on</p>

          <p>um and some of these relate a bit back</p>

          <p>to some of the previous questions so i'm</p>

          <p>just going to go through them</p>

          <p>um as they've cropped up okay</p>

          <p>so William has asked would you like</p>

          <p>diversity engagement</p>

          <p>assessed by health education for example</p>

          <p>as part of the quality</p>

          <p>impact outcome framework assessment</p>

          <p>do we are we thinking about equality and</p>

          <p>diversity of library knowledge services</p>

          <p>as part of the new</p>

          <p>is that what we're saying I think so</p>

          <p>yeah</p>

          <p>being specified whether it's workforce</p>

          <p>or library</p>

          <p>services stuff but um I suppose either</p>

          <p>or both</p>

          <p>well I think we we are in the refresh of</p>

          <p>the knowledge for healthcare</p>

          <p>you've got diversity is much more</p>

          <p>explicit in there</p>

          <p>in the um driver diagrams and things</p>

          <p>um i</p>

          <p>oh I’m not sure I’m not sure I have a</p>

          <p>library with my library manager hat on i</p>

          <p>think the quality improvement outcomes</p>

          <p>is</p>

          <p>big enough and the other thing is like</p>

          <p>Hong-Anh talks saying you know we</p>

          <p>shouldn't be doing any new stuff</p>

          <p>this stuff should become mainstream and</p>

          <p>should be part of um you know</p>

          <p>the way that we make sure that our</p>

          <p>collections are are comprehensive and</p>

          <p>addressing all the relevant issues for</p>

          <p>our</p>

          <p>organizations yeah</p>

          <p>no I don't think so I I think it</p>

          <p>depends</p>

          <p>so I I think I think it depends on</p>

          <p>how we want to encourage libraries to</p>

          <p>pay attention to this</p>

          <p>so one way to do it is through that</p>

          <p>means I don't work in an nhs library so</p>

          <p>I have no idea of</p>

          <p>um what it means to kind of do the the</p>

          <p>quality framework assessment</p>

          <p>and what that might add if we we add</p>

          <p>that in it but</p>

          <p>I think there are other ways to try and</p>

          <p>encourage</p>

          <p>um people like libraries to pay</p>

          <p>attention to edi</p>

          <p>in their services it doesn't just have</p>

          <p>to be through this</p>

          <p>and if we if it was included it</p>

          <p>shouldn't be only through that either</p>

          <p>yeah I I think I agree with you and I</p>

          <p>attended some training yesterday</p>

          <p>actually on um the legalities of</p>

          <p>equality diversity and human rights and</p>

          <p>and they made a really interesting</p>

          <p>point that we can be using our equality</p>

          <p>impact assessments</p>

          <p>on um things like developing new</p>

          <p>teaching programs</p>

          <p>to ensure that we're checking that</p>

          <p>everything is inclusive</p>

          <p>we've explored all options when we're</p>

          <p>doing those things so that might be</p>

          <p>something to think about</p>

          <p>for us as well</p>

          <p>okay back to the chat there's lots of</p>

          <p>things going on</p>

          <p>um so Shakira has said how to navigate</p>

          <p>these conversations with colleagues</p>

          <p>as a black woman I almost anticipate</p>

          <p>ignorant comments and don't feel it is</p>

          <p>my duty to emotionally drain myself</p>

          <p>should just I be more involved um</p>

          <p>no I think you need to be the priority I</p>

          <p>think is you need to look after yourself</p>

          <p>if you don't feel you can do it in the</p>

          <p>moment or ever then then I don't think</p>

          <p>it's for you to take it on</p>

          <p>I I don't think um I</p>

          <p>I’m talking to some older colleagues</p>

          <p>the group I I was having a</p>

          <p>conversation with the</p>

          <p>I don't think she's on the call today</p>

          <p>but she was sort of saying you know we</p>

          <p>were doing this work 20 years ago</p>

          <p>in libraries then it kind of dropped off</p>

          <p>and I come back and she's like I just</p>

          <p>want to get on with my job</p>

          <p>um and so I think it's for those who</p>

          <p>have the energy right now me and hang</p>

          <p>out and got a bit of energy right now</p>

          <p>to do this work and then you know maybe</p>

          <p>we'll step back and some other people</p>

          <p>will take it up in a couple of years um</p>

          <p>I'm</p>

          <p>sorry you have to anticipate those</p>

          <p>comments and it's just it's just</p>

          <p>draining because</p>

          <p>I think speaking for myself I don't want</p>

          <p>to be talking about this I just like to</p>

          <p>get on with my life</p>

          <p>and just be me but</p>

          <p>you know we can't get away from it and</p>

          <p>uh yeah</p>

          <p>yeah I would totally agree it's</p>

          <p>yeah you need to make the best decision</p>

          <p>for you</p>

          <p>and um if you if you don't want to</p>

          <p>engage in those conversations</p>

          <p>don't it's if if the emotional burden of</p>

          <p>it is too much</p>

          <p>if it takes away from you progressing in</p>

          <p>your career</p>

          <p>using time for your own career</p>

          <p>progression for other things in your</p>

          <p>life that are valuable</p>

          <p>no don't do it um you know like I think</p>

          <p>I I saw a tweet the other day which was</p>

          <p>about kind of um</p>

          <p>imagine all like the great black writers</p>

          <p>if if they if racism</p>

          <p>didn't exist</p>

          <p>what would their work be about but as it</p>

          <p>is they had to devote their intellectual</p>

          <p>energy</p>

          <p>to writing about this stuff you do not</p>

          <p>have to devote your energy to that</p>

          <p>um if you want to then that's great but</p>

          <p>as we've said before the push is not for</p>

          <p>um it's for everyone to pick up this</p>

          <p>baton</p>

          <p>um and no one can do this work</p>

          <p>indefinitely</p>

          <p>and yeah I like Natasha like this is not</p>

          <p>this is not necessarily what I want to</p>

          <p>be spending my time on but</p>

          <p>here we are</p>

          <p>[Laughter]</p>

          <p>um what I will say is that</p>

          <p>uh it's not like I don't get anything</p>

          <p>from this work so it's been really</p>

          <p>developmental for me being involved in</p>

          <p>this work it's really helped me to build</p>

          <p>um skills and stuff that maybe i</p>

          <p>wouldn't have gotten the chance to</p>

          <p>at this point in my career in a library</p>

          <p>role</p>

          <p>so my ability to kind of</p>

          <p>um influence upwards has really been</p>

          <p>honed</p>

          <p>by um being involved in edI work um in</p>

          <p>thinking kind of really strategically</p>

          <p>for example I probably wouldn't be able</p>

          <p>to do that unless I’ve got</p>

          <p>up to the next rung of the ladder in my</p>

          <p>career so</p>

          <p>there are benefits but it's up to you to</p>

          <p>decide</p>

          <p>what the trade-off is between like your</p>

          <p>emotional</p>

          <p>mental health because it is draining and</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>whether you want to kind of progress</p>

          <p>your career in that way and through this</p>

          <p>channel</p>

          <p>yeah so i'll just come in again they're</p>

          <p>hanging just to echo about what you're</p>

          <p>saying the work what I'm</p>

          <p>starting to do now with the ethnic</p>

          <p>minority network being a strategic</p>

          <p>ambassador means you know I’m in contact</p>

          <p>with all these much senior</p>

          <p>members of staff one there that keeps</p>

          <p>from and really enjoying getting to know</p>

          <p>them as well</p>

          <p>and the other thing we're talking about</p>

          <p>careers is that it's only in the last</p>

          <p>couple of years I’ve started talking</p>

          <p>about these issues and that's because</p>

          <p>I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>been around for a long time now um I’ve&nbsp;</p>

          <p>been at that stage in my career where i</p>

          <p>feel comfortable having a talk about</p>

          <p>these issues</p>

          <p>when I was first qualified in my first</p>

          <p>job I wouldn't</p>

          <p>have wanted to go there and I it might</p>

          <p>have been unwise to have gone there</p>

          <p>whereas now I’m not that I’m untouchable</p>

          <p>but it's just a bit more</p>

          <p>it's just a perhaps a bit more with age</p>

          <p>as well at ease with myself I guess</p>

          <p>um the other thing I was saying you're</p>

          <p>saying about what you get out of it</p>

          <p>um I’ve told you to Hong-Anh before is</p>

          <p>that I do feel</p>

          <p>when I do this work it's one of the ways</p>

          <p>I like that I honour the ancestors</p>

          <p>and really just be thankful for the fact</p>

          <p>that you know</p>

          <p>people who went through hideous time you</p>

          <p>know I’m here and I'm</p>

          <p>able to feel bits to try and make things</p>

          <p>better for those who are coming after us</p>

          <p>I do get something out of it yeah</p>

          <p>thank you thank you Shakira for the</p>

          <p>question I think that's really powerful</p>

          <p>and</p>

          <p>certainly personally that makes me feel</p>

          <p>like I should be paying more attention</p>

          <p>to pick up when those things are</p>

          <p>happening so I can step in for my</p>

          <p>colleagues</p>

          <p>and that's definitely on my action list</p>

          <p>from now on</p>

          <p>and Shakira has said thank you as well</p>

          <p>she says thanks for your responses I'm</p>

          <p>sure many um people of colour in</p>

          <p>libraries are outnumbered so it can be</p>

          <p>a daunting task absolutely yeah</p>

          <p>yeah okay um just</p>

          <p>quickly we've had some great uh links</p>

          <p>from -- on</p>

          <p>um writing styles so we will link those</p>

          <p>as well</p>

          <p>because it says we're absolutely</p>

          <p>committed in knowledge for healthcare to</p>

          <p>build growth and develop a diverse and</p>

          <p>inclusive library knowledge services</p>

          <p>workforce</p>

          <p>um but then William does mention and</p>

          <p>this is absolutely true</p>

          <p>I guess diversity isn't once in the</p>

          <p>quality impact outcome framework so</p>

          <p>perhaps even if it isn't assessed it</p>

          <p>should be mentioned</p>

          <p>I think that's a really important point</p>

          <p>I will take back to my colleagues thank</p>

          <p>you William</p>

          <p>um so</p>

          <p>what we're going to do now is I’m going</p>

          <p>to unmute you</p>

          <p>all so if you can just muted</p>

          <p>yourself so we're not</p>

          <p>suddenly inundated with background</p>

          <p>information and then you can ask</p>

          <p>questions if you want to using the hand</p>

          <p>up function</p>

          <p>okay here we go</p>

          <p>you can just mute yourself please</p>

          <p>anybody want to ask a question please</p>

          <p>put your hands up</p>

          <p>I don't see any hands coming up just yet</p>

          <p>you can also still use the chat if you</p>

          <p>want to to ask questions</p>

          <p>or make comments about the things that</p>

          <p>we've been discussing today</p>

          <p>otherwise let me just scroll down a</p>

          <p>little I’ve got</p>

          <p>hand, Bertha I’m just going to come to</p>

          <p>you I’m going to unmute you</p>

          <p>so please ask your question hi uh well</p>

          <p>rather instead of</p>

          <p>a question I just wanted to share things</p>

          <p>that we have been doing here at</p>

          <p>MSC at Southend</p>

          <p>so um I started this job in February</p>

          <p>2019</p>

          <p>and when I first started one of the</p>

          <p>first things was to get involved with</p>

          <p>different groups</p>

          <p>just to attend to the meetings um i</p>

          <p>attended to the faith group</p>

          <p>and I attended to the BAME group so when</p>

          <p>I attended to the BAME group i</p>

          <p>found out that there was so much work</p>

          <p>that we could contribute</p>

          <p>and from then um we started this</p>

          <p>diversity collection</p>

          <p>here and more recently we started this</p>

          <p>inclusion and diversity bulletin</p>

          <p>which has been well received so I think</p>

          <p>for me</p>

          <p>just sharing my experience is um we need</p>

          <p>to be curious</p>

          <p>what what's going on what's around there</p>

          <p>um you know as librarians we think of</p>

          <p>doctors and nurses but there is</p>

          <p>managers their managers their uh</p>

          <p>porters there is so much going on and we</p>

          <p>are not curious to find out what are</p>

          <p>their life and how we can serve them</p>

          <p>then if it's all all these things going</p>

          <p>uh hanging around</p>

          <p>so I don't feel myself &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I</p>

          <p>am um I am not BAME</p>

          <p>but if you see my face and if you hear</p>

          <p>my</p>

          <p>voice then you know that I’m not a white</p>

          <p>british</p>

          <p>but where I come from I’m a white</p>

          <p>privileged person I’m from mexico</p>

          <p>and in that context is how I learn about</p>

          <p>my privilege</p>

          <p>and I still hold this privilege here</p>

          <p>because at some point I just shut down</p>

          <p>but I noticed that if I shut down then i</p>

          <p>don't learn</p>

          <p>and yeah so this is what I wanted to</p>

          <p>share with you</p>

          <p>that's wonderful thank you and I think</p>

          <p>your point about curiosity is so</p>

          <p>important</p>

          <p>um it's a really important trait</p>

          <p>for our profession in general but yeah</p>

          <p>especially for this</p>

          <p>it's about being curious about how other</p>

          <p>people's lives</p>

          <p>are different from yours other people</p>

          <p>have different viewpoints obviously with</p>

          <p>different experiences</p>

          <p>um they're not all necessarily bad but</p>

          <p>they are different</p>

          <p>um and just having that understanding um</p>

          <p>to broaden your worldview is so</p>

          <p>important for this</p>

          <p>yeah thanks Bertha I did actually mean I</p>

          <p>don't know if we did put it on the</p>

          <p>reading list we were going to flag up</p>

          <p>your</p>

          <p>um bulletin if that's okay um but that's</p>

          <p>a result that people might want to</p>

          <p>read for themselves or to um uh forward</p>

          <p>just to subscribe and forward to other</p>

          <p>colleagues in their organization and</p>

          <p>that will do once more share things</p>

          <p>thank you okay I’ve got a question this</p>

          <p>is a good question from the chat</p>

          <p>and from an anonymous person our manager</p>

          <p>is very concerned about us doing</p>

          <p>anything which seems</p>

          <p>political um do you have any suggestions</p>

          <p>for helping to affirm that this is not</p>

          <p>politics but essential work for the</p>

          <p>library</p>

          <p>oh tricky because I think it is</p>

          <p>political isn't it I think the nh</p>

          <p>the nhs is inherently political</p>

          <p>unfortunately</p>

          <p>uh that's not helpful though for the</p>

          <p>question and</p>

          <p>can we bring it back to thinking about</p>

          <p>like we said earlier on about the health</p>

          <p>inequalities about the social</p>

          <p>determinants that kind of</p>

          <p>aspect um how it ties into prevention</p>

          <p>and these kind of things I mean I think</p>

          <p>yeah</p>

          <p>libraries aren't neutral and I think you</p>

          <p>know if you don't</p>

          <p>you don't take a stance you know you're</p>

          <p>on the side of the oppressors</p>

          <p>you know you you I think people should</p>

          <p>be taking a start with pro</p>

          <p>pro equality um and pro-social justice</p>

          <p>and I</p>

          <p>appreciate that it's hard to articulate</p>

          <p>managers</p>

          <p>yeah so um I think it depends on how</p>

          <p>comfortable you feel with having</p>

          <p>a one-to-one conversation with this</p>

          <p>manager but um</p>

          <p>I don't think they mean political I</p>

          <p>think that's a coded word</p>

          <p>I think that what I’m really saying is i</p>

          <p>don't really feel comfortable with this</p>

          <p>or I don't really get what this is about</p>

          <p>um</p>

          <p>one of the most important things in this</p>

          <p>work is to utilize your personal</p>

          <p>relationships</p>

          <p>because um you know</p>

          <p>there is so much fear and uncertainty</p>

          <p>that people hold around this work</p>

          <p>so actually using your personal</p>

          <p>relationship having those one-to-one</p>

          <p>chats</p>

          <p>they can become a really safe space to</p>

          <p>help people to understand</p>

          <p>um things that maybe they don't have</p>

          <p>space to talk about</p>

          <p>elsewhere so yeah I think if you can</p>

          <p>feel comfortable to have that</p>

          <p>conversation and</p>

          <p>say to them you know what do you mean by</p>

          <p>political um</p>

          <p>why is that necessarily bad why is it</p>

          <p>out of our remit</p>

          <p>this is the way I see it see what</p>

          <p>happens out of that conversation</p>

          <p>because yeah I I don't think they mean political</p>

          <p>[Laughter]</p>

          <p>thank you that is that is tough um</p>

          <p>and it's something and I think um</p>

          <p>you just have to keep talking about it</p>

          <p>yeah yeah um so Bertha said we can</p>

          <p>share the bulletin which is great we</p>

          <p>will definitely do that</p>

          <p>I’m going to come to Trisha now and just</p>

          <p>unmute you because she's got her hand up</p>

          <p>um let me just do some scrolling</p>

          <p>so Trisha</p>

          <p>holly my doorbell's going I’m sorry i'll</p>

          <p>be back in a sec</p>

          <p>no worries um</p>

          <p>I’m just uh wondering</p>

          <p>how far we should be also including</p>

          <p>other people the underserved</p>

          <p>so there are white</p>

          <p>sections of society who are</p>

          <p>discriminated against because of where</p>

          <p>they live</p>

          <p>or how they speak and also</p>

          <p>I just make the point we need to be</p>

          <p>quite careful about the language we use</p>

          <p>you know people still use um</p>

          <p>quite a lot of</p>

          <p>unacceptable language say like</p>

          <p>chav or something like that and</p>

          <p>people use it</p>

          <p>without even thinking about it and I was</p>

          <p>just having a discussion with somebody</p>

          <p>today at work about</p>

          <p>this aspect of it</p>

          <p>yeah yeah I think that's a really good</p>

          <p>point uh I'll just recap for</p>

          <p>Natasha who's just come back as Tricia</p>

          <p>had a point about you know thinking</p>

          <p>about um</p>

          <p>other underrepresented groups so</p>

          <p>thinking about kind of um</p>

          <p>you know uh groups that socioeconomic</p>

          <p>disadvantage for example</p>

          <p>um yeah um I I think this is why</p>

          <p>it's important to take an intersectional</p>

          <p>approach to this this is</p>

          <p>there's an order of uh lord quote that i</p>

          <p>love which is um</p>

          <p>around you know um we don't live</p>

          <p>single issue lives um and</p>

          <p>intersectionality is about that you know</p>

          <p>um if we take up the cause of race</p>

          <p>equality then we're also taking up the</p>

          <p>cause</p>

          <p>of um of lgbt equality too of gender</p>

          <p>equality of um</p>

          <p>classism um ableism you know all those</p>

          <p>things are intertwined</p>

          <p>all oppression is connected so um</p>

          <p>our approach to that should also be</p>

          <p>connected to holistic so yeah absolutely</p>

          <p>that's</p>

          <p>that's uh that's essential for us to</p>

          <p>think about as well</p>

          <p>but also all fashion is connected but</p>

          <p>they're all</p>

          <p>also distinct that they all need</p>

          <p>slightly different approaches to</p>

          <p>everyone experiences slightly different</p>

          <p>challenges as well</p>

          <p>thank you got a few more things coming</p>

          <p>up on the chat</p>

          <p>um so uh in related to</p>

          <p>the um the previous question about</p>

          <p>um managers who think this is too</p>

          <p>political</p>

          <p>um Helen has said uh that her trust is</p>

          <p>very anxious to take this on and at</p>

          <p>every meeting and at every level we're</p>

          <p>being asked to</p>

          <p>consider Black Lives Matter I think it's</p>

          <p>less politically risky than it used to</p>

          <p>be</p>

          <p>so maybe it goes back to that point you</p>

          <p>mentioned uh right at the beginning Hong-Anh</p>

          <p>about or was it Natasha sorry about</p>

          <p>finding case studies from other</p>

          <p>organizations of what they're doing and</p>

          <p>why it's been so um</p>

          <p>uh good for their service</p>

          <p>yeah you don't have to reinvent the</p>

          <p>wheel there's</p>

          <p>lots of great practice going on out</p>

          <p>there</p>

          <p>and and uh um a a suggestion rather than</p>

          <p>a uh question um</p>

          <p>saying she's currently reading an</p>

          <p>excellent book she's learned a lot and</p>

          <p>she's only a few chapters in called why</p>

          <p>I’m not talking to white people about</p>

          <p>race by Reni Eddo-Lodge</p>

          <p>which I think is on</p>

          <p>your reading list is it not I believe</p>

          <p>it's on the reading list yeah</p>

          <p>yeah it is yeah we've got uh we've got</p>

          <p>that on our reading list and also a</p>

          <p>couple of others as well which</p>

          <p>are kind of if if you're interested in</p>

          <p>kind of continuing your reading journey</p>

          <p>around that</p>

          <p>and there's more stuff like that on</p>

          <p>there</p>

          <p>okay I can't see any more hands up</p>

          <p>apologies if I’ve missed you um and it</p>

          <p>is three o'clock now</p>

          <p>and there aren't any more questions on</p>

          <p>the chat</p>

          <p>so I think we will wrap this up if</p>

          <p>that's okay unless either of you want</p>

          <p>any more um comments before we go</p>

          <p>no I just thank everyone for joining in</p>

          <p>and engaging with us on this it's um</p>

          <p>it's</p>

          <p>piece um</p>

          <p>where we will talk about uh how health</p>

          <p>libraries should</p>

          <p>respond to other people perhaps within</p>

          <p>the protected characteristics so</p>

          <p>that would be interesting we'd be really</p>

          <p>interested to hear from you</p>

          <p>um and we will be publishing this</p>

          <p>webinar as a recording</p>

          <p>and its transcript our list of resources</p>

          <p>which we've been talking about all</p>

          <p>next few weeks so please keep an eye out</p>

          <p>for that</p>

          <p>and the other thing I'd really</p>

          <p>appreciate is if when you receive your</p>

          <p>evaluation form please fill it in</p>

          <p>there'll be a section there for you to</p>

          <p>make a pledge I think we've all have</p>

          <p>some actions to take away from today</p>

          <p>about the things that we can do going</p>

          <p>forward</p>

        hee:description: Every day across the healthcare sector in England more than
          a million decisions are made that have a profound and lasting impact on
          people's lives and which influence the quality of healthcare and the cost
          of services.  Librarians and Knowledge Specialists use their expertise to
          work with healthcare teams to ensure that knowledge and evidence are used
          effectively to inform these decisions, helping teams to build upon best
          practice and share know-how, bringing the power for change.
