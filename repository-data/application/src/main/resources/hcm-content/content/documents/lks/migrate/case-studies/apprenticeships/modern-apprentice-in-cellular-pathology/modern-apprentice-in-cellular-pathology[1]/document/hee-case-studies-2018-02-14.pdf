Charlie Brown is a 19-year-old Advanced Medical Engineering Apprentice from Leeds. Charlie started his A 
Levels but quickly realised that he wasn?t enjoying his courses and he decided that remaining in the school 
environment was not the right choice for him.

Charlie is currently undertaking a four year Advanced Medical Engineering Apprenticeship in partnership 
with Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and its training partner JTL.  He learning how to maintain and 
service critical hospital equipment such as X-Ray machines and Linear Accelerators used for radiotherapy 
treatment.

During the first two years of his apprenticeship Charlie attended Kirklees College in Huddersfield on a day 
release basis and successfully completed a Level 3 BTec in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.  Charlie 
has now begun a Healthcare Science foundation degree (FdSc) at the UWE in Bristol. This is a distance 
learning course that will take Charlie two years to complete.

Where are you from?

Leeds

How did you end up doing an apprenticeship?

I did my first year of A Levels but as the year progressed I felt it wasn?t for me. I didn?t find the content of 
my lessons or courses interesting and I realised I needed to look for an alternative. I was also keen to start 
earning some money whilst continuing my education. I applied for an apprenticeship elsewhere, but whilst 
doing that I heard about this opportunity with the NHS. I thought it sounded really interesting and was 
something a bit different, so I applied and was accepted.

What did your job role involve?

My role involves learning how to maintain and service medical equipment across St James?s University 
Hospital and The Leeds General Infirmary. The equipment that I work on is really important and varied, 
such as X-Ray machines, Linear Accelerators and patient connected monitoring equipment. I am also being 
trained to maintain and manage the clinical computing equipment that interfaces and controls many medical 
devices. What I do is really important because it enables the doctors and nurses to do their jobs and treat 
patients.

What is your favourite thing about your apprenticeship?

I really enjoy getting the opportunity to spend time in different hospitals. It means that no two days are the 
same and there?s lots of variety. I work as part of a large team and there?s always somebody to help me or 
to offer their advice. It is very rewarding to be part of a team that works with other healthcare staff to 
provide safe and effective care for patients. The apprenticeship also enables me to get where I want to be 
and gain skills and recognised qualifications without getting myself into debt.

Charlie, what?s next for your career progression?



As part of my apprenticeship I?ve been able to start a Foundation Degree in Healthcare Science. The 
foundation degree will take two years to complete, but within the next year I will also have built up enough 
experience to start applying for jobs in Medical Engineering. It?s great knowing that I?ve got the 
opportunity to get a Foundation degree and, with the practical hands on skills that I am learning, I will be in 
a good position to progress my career in Medical Engineering.

About the Advanced Medical Engineering Apprenticeship:

During the Advanced Medical Engineering Apprenticeship, apprentices can expect to be sent on varied work 
placements throughout the Medical Physics and Engineering department. Apprentices are trained by 
experienced clinical technologists to be proficient in the use of both hand tools and machinery such as centre 
lathes, milling machines, pillar drills and also complex test and calibration equipment.  They are also taught 
how to design and manufacture bespoke products for use in both servicing and clinical applications. As well 
as being involved in the servicing and repair of diagnostic, monitoring, computing and treatment equipment, 
apprentices also attend and observe clinical procedures and gain a patient?s perspective and clinical 
appreciation of how medical devices are used.

 

During the four year fixed term contract, apprentices work towards achieving NVQ Level 3 Advanced 
Engineering and BTEC National Certificate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Potential opportunities 
for further education are also available.

Technology enhanced learning apprentice

Where are you from?

Grays in Thurrock, Essex



How did you find your apprenticeship?

I finished college but I really didn?t know what to do next. Initially I thought about University, but I wasn?t 
convinced it would be for me. I started looking at lots of different job websites to see what was out there. I 
hadn?t considered the NHS and I didn?t even know they offered apprenticeships, but when I saw the outline 
of this apprenticeship I was really interested.

How long have you been doing your apprenticeship?

11 months.

What does your apprenticeship involve?

My apprenticeship is really varied, so no two days are the same! Technology enhanced learning is about 
using technology to support learning, so part of my role is helping to create e-learning courses, interactive 
digital media and videos for learning. One day I?ll be designing and making posters, the next I?ll be filming 
with our Chief Executive.  I?ve recently been involved in filming footage and creating images for 
prospectuses. The last one I helped create was over 80 pages long.

What do you enjoy most about your apprenticeship?

I really enjoy working in a busy office environment and learning as I go. I didn?t think that an apprentice 
would get the opportunity to be as ?hands-on? as I am and I feel like I?m learning a lot from the team.  I 
was recently invited to my first conference. I?d never been to one before and that was a really interesting 
experience.

What?s next for your career progression?

I?m really enjoying the apprenticeship, so I?m hoping that it will lead to a permanent role in the Technology 
Enhanced Learning Team.

About the Technology Enhanced Learning Apprenticeship

As part of the Technology Enhanced Learning Apprenticeship, apprentices learn how to research, plan and 
create videos, web content, photography and other digital media productions to enhance learning on 
Basildon and Thurrock Hospital?s dedicated virtual learning environment ?ULearn? or the Trust?s Intranet 
site. Apprentices undertake a Level 3 Diploma in IT Professional Competence which includes; Customer 
care, System operations, Website & Imaging Software, Using email, Technical advice and guidance, 
developing own effectiveness and professionalism as well as Health and Safety. The second part to the 
framework is Level 3 Diploma in ICT Systems and Professionalism which includes; Web fundamentals, 
Web development, e-Commerce as well as Communication and Employability skills for IT. All of this is 
designed to give the apprentice the skills they need to progress their IT career.



Modern apprentice in cellular pathology

Dylan Connolly 

Close X

Dylan Connolly is an 18-year-old Modern Apprentice in Cellular Pathology from Preston. After moving to a 
new city after his first year of A-Levels, Dylan realised he?d lost interest in the subjects he was studying. 
Instead of starting again at a new college, Dylan decided to make use of his passion for biology and applied 
for an apprenticeship.

Dylan started his apprenticeship in Cellular Pathology at the Royal Preston Hospital in 2016. He is 
responsible for helping to assisting at post-mortems on patients and releasing bodies to undertakers, as well 
as testing samples in the hospital?s laboratory. As part of his apprenticeship, Dylan is studying for a BTEC 
level 3 in Science at his local college and a laboratory-based NVQ 3. He is looking forward to learning as 
much as he can during his time at Royal Preston and hopes to apply for a place on a university course in 
Biomedical Science on completion of his apprenticeship.

Age

I?m 18. I started my apprenticeship about six months ago.

Where are you from?

Barrow-In-Furness, Cumbria

How did you end up doing an apprenticeship?

I went to school in Stoke and did my first year of A-Levels. My family moved to Preston shortly after, so I 
was faced with the choice of starting again at a new college, or looking at my other options. I didn?t enjoy 
my A-Level courses and I just wasn?t passionate about them. It became harder and harder to find the 
motivation to do the work, so I decided that carrying on at college wasn?t the right option for me. I?ve 
always been interested in biology, especially Pathology. I saw an opening for an apprenticeship at the Royal 
Preston Hospital, applied, and was successful. I?m really passionate about my apprenticeship because I?m 
training in something I?m genuinely interested in.

What did your job role involve?

As I?m fairly new to the apprenticeship, I spend most mornings working in the hospital?s mortuary. My 
main tasks are assisting at post-mortems on patients and releasing bodies to undertakers. Post-mortems are 



carried out by pathologists to determine the cause of death. It?s a really interesting sector.

In the afternoon I usually go up to the laboratory where I work alongside qualified pathologists in the ?Cut-
Up? section. Here, we test tissue samples from organs like colons, uteruses and kidneys. Our tests are used 
to diagnose major diseases like cancer, and lower-risk conditions like cysts.

What is your favourite thing about your apprenticeship?

I really enjoy working in the mortuary. It?s a really privileged job - most people would never get to see a 
post-mortem in real-life. I?m learning something new every day.

Dylan, what?s next for your career progression?

At the moment I?m at college as part of my apprenticeship, doing a BTEC in Science. I?m also getting my 
NVQ for working in the lab.

Once I?ve finished my apprenticeship, in about a year and a half, I?m hoping to apply for a place at 
university to do a degree in Biomedical Science.

About the Pathology Apprenticeship

As a Modern Apprentice in Cellular Pathology, the apprentice will be responsible for a range of laboratory-
based pathology tasks, using a range of cutting edge scientific technologies. Apprentices will work in both a 
laboratory and the mortuary, with tasks such as passing instruments like scalpels to pathologists, taking 
tissue samples, weighing organs as they?re removed from a body, taking samples for lab analysis and 
recording the findings of a post-mortem exam. In the laboratory they will be responsible for assisting 
pathologists with testing samples for diseases and abnormalities. As well as their work within a hospital, 
apprentices will attend college to gain BTEC level 3 and NVQ 3 qualifications. On completion of the 
apprenticeship, apprentices are often qualified to apply for a university place or in the future may be able to 
undertake degree level training via the apprenticeship route.
