Summary of 
problem or 
reason for 
enquiry(3 
sentences) 

The Clinical Evidence Specialist conducted a literature search 
around offender health and the control of diabetes with a 
specialist interest in nurse-led outpatient care. 

Briefly 
describe what 
information 
was found 

My team presently provides outpatient care to diabetic patients 
within secure facilities. The patient, in the past, has been required 
to attend appointments within the hospital. This service is costly 
and necessitates two prison guards securely transporting patients 
to the hospital. They then have to accompany the patient in the 
Outpatient’s Waiting Room and then transport them back. This is 
a high-risk situation that causes uneccessary issues, distress for 
the patient and other attendees and is likely to result in a high 
number of Did Not Attends (DNAs). Prisoners, for several 
reasons are unable to attend their appointments and this is 
problematic for waiting lists and vehicle arrangements.  
 
A couple of the papers retrieved by the Clinical Evidence 
Specialist highlighted a Diabetes Nurse Specialist Outreach 
Service. This is where the nurse visits the prison to provide 
outpatient care. This ultimately improves patient care and 
eliminates DNAs. The prison guards are not required to attend 
appointments and costs savings have been realised.  
 
 

 

Give up to 
four short 
quotations 
demonstrating 
how patient 
care changed 

1: There has been a cost saving of around £48,500 with a 
reduction in DNAs, not requiring transport or supervisory prison 
guards. 
 
2: The Clinical Evidence Specialist was able to recall evidence 
that it would have taken me much longer to find. This enabled a

as a result of 
the 
information 
provided  or 
found 

quick publication of my research and implementation of the 
service. 
 
3: I presented the findings of the study, based on the evidence 
sourced by the library, to present at the Primary Care & Public 
Health Conference 2014. This service will now be implemented 
nationally.  
 
4: Ultimately, the service now provides improved patient care for 
offenders. They are less distressed at being transported, they 
receive thorough, tailored and appropriate care and the nurse is 
able to see all patients.
