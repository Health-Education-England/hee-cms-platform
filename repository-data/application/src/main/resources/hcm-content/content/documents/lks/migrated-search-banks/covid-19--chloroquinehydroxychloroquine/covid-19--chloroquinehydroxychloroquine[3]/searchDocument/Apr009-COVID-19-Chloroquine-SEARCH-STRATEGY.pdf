Abstract The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and then spread rapidly worldwide, particularly to China, 

Japan, and South Korea. Scientists are endeavoring to find antivirals specific to the virus. Several drugs such as 
chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to test their efficacy 
and safety in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China; some promising results have 
been achieved thus far. This article summarizes agents with potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract AbstractChloroquine is a long-established prescription drug that is often used clinically to treat malaria and 

connective tissue diseases. Since December 2019, COVID-19 （corona virus disease 2019） outbreaks caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 （severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2） has occurred in China and many 
countries around the world. Due to the lack of drugs against COVID-19, the disease spreads rapidly and the 
mortality rate is relatively high. Therefore, specific drugs against SARS-CoV-2 need to be quickly screened. The 
antimalarial drug Chloroquine phosphate which has already been approved is confirmed to have an anti-SARS-
CoV-2 effect and has been included in diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines. However, awareness of the risk of 
chloroquine phosphate causing acute poisoning or even death should be strengthened. The dosage used 
according to current clinical recommended dosage and course of treatment are larger than that of previous 
treatment of malaria. Many provinces have required close clinical monitoring of adverse reactions. This paper 
reviews the pharmacological effects, poisoning and toxicological mechanisms, in vivo metabolism and 
distribution, and forensic issues of chloroquine drugs, in order to provide help to forensic practice and clinical 
work.

Abstract Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (formerly known as the 2019 novel coronavirus 
[2019-nCoV]) in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in 
more than 2000 deaths worldwide. Despite the fact that most COVID-19 cases and mortalities were reported 
in China, the WHO has declared this outbreak as the sixth public health emergency of international concern. 
The COVID-19 can present as an asymptomatic carrier state, acute respiratory disease, and pneumonia. Adults 
represent the population with the highest infection rate; however, neonates, children, and elderly patients can 
also be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, nosocomial infection of hospitalized patients and healthcare 
workers, and viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers are possible. The most common finding on chest 
imaging among patients with pneumonia was ground-glass opacity with bilateral involvement. Severe cases are 
more likely to be older patients with underlying comorbidities compared to mild cases. Indeed, age and disease 
severity may be correlated with the outcomes of COVID-19. To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, 
clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in 
China. Currently, effective infection control intervention is the only way to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract Recently, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China. Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. 
SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary 
infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and 
isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In 
the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made 
sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this 
molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. 
Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, 
leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the 
SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan 
(China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 
infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable 
safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the 
immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that 
occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the 
use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection.METHODSThe pharmacological activity of chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic 
models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK 
models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to 
explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile.RESULTSHydroxychloroquine 
(EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK 
models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a 
maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it 
reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in 
advance.CONCLUSIONSHydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-
CoV-2 in vitro.

Abstract The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia pandemic, caused by the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, is spreading globally at an accelerated rate, with a basic 
reproduction number (R0) of 2 - 2.5, indicating that 2 - 3 persons will be infected from an index patient. A 
serious public health emergency, it is particularly deadly in vulnerable populations and communities in which 
healthcare providers are insufficiently prepared to manage the infection. As of March 16, 2020, there are more 
than 180,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with over 7,000 related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus 
has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals, and affected patients continue to be infectious two weeks 
after cessation of symptoms. The substantial morbidity and socioeconomic impact have necessitated drastic 
measures across all continents, including nationwide lockdowns and border closures. Pregnant women and 
their fetuses represent a high-risk population during infectious disease outbreaks. To date, the outcomes of 55 
pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates have been reported in the literature, with no 
definite evidence of vertical transmission. Physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy increase 
susceptibility to infections in general, particularly when the cardiorespiratory system is affected, and encourage 
rapid progression to respiratory failure in the gravida. Furthermore, the pregnancy bias towards T-helper 2 
(Th2) system dominance which protects the fetus, leaves the mother vulnerable to viral infections, which are 
more effectively contained by the Th1 system. These unique challenges mandate an integrated approach to 
pregnancies affected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a review of COVID-19 in pregnancy, bringing together 
the various factors integral to the understanding of pathophysiology and susceptibility, diagnostic challenges 
with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, therapeutic controversies, 
intrauterine transmission and maternal-fetal complications. We discuss the latest options in antiviral therapy 
and vaccine development, including the novel use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19. Fetal 
surveillance, in view of the predisposition to growth restriction and special considerations during labor and 
delivery are addressed. Additionally, we focus on keeping frontline obstetric care providers safe while 
continuing to provide essential services. Our clinical service model is built around the principles of workplace 
segregation, responsible social distancing, containment of cross-infection to healthcare providers, judicious use 
of personal protective equipment and telemedicine. Our aim is to share a framework which can be adopted by 
tertiary maternity units managing pregnant women in the flux of a pandemic while maintaining the safety of the 
patient and healthcare provider at its core.

Abstract ImportanceVirus infection has been widely described as one of the most common causes of myocarditis. 

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.ObjectiveTo describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation 
in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and 
developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract 
symptoms.Design, Setting, and ParticipantThis case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman 
who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute 
myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after 
onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during 
the clinical course.ExposureCardiac involvement with COVID-19.Main Outcomes and MeasuresDetection of 
cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and 
high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late 
gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.ResultsAn otherwise healthy 53-year-old 
white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough 
the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and 
elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were 
normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the 
COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased 
wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left 
ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping 
sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late 
gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial 
effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute 
myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, 
and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.Conclusions and 
RelevanceThis case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without 
symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.

Abstract The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and scientists are endeavoring to discover 

drugs for its efficacious treatment in China. Chloroquine phosphate, an old drug for treatment of malaria, is 
shown to have apparent efficacy and acceptable safety against COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multicenter 
clinical trials conducted in China. The drug is recommended to be included in the next version of the Guidelines 
for the Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by COVID-19 issued by the National Health

Abstract PURPOSECOVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a public health emergency of international concern. As of 
this time, there is no known effective pharmaceutical treatment, although it is much needed for patient 
contracting the severe form of the disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence 
regarding chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.METHODSPubMed, EMBASE, and three trial Registries 
were searched for studies on the use of chloroquine in patients with COVID-19.RESULTSWe included six 
articles (one narrative letter, one in-vitro study, one editorial, expert consensus paper, two national guideline 
documents) and 23 ongoing clinical trials in China. Chloroquine seems to be effective in limiting the replication 
of SARS-CoV-2 (virus causing COVID-19) in vitro.CONCLUSIONSThere is rationale, pre-clinical evidence of 
effectiveness and evidence of safety from long-time clinical use for other indications to justify clinical research 
on chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. However, clinical use should either adhere to the Monitored 
Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework or be ethically approved as a trial as stated 
by the World Health Organization. Safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed.

Abstract A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has swept across 31 provinces 

in China and over 40 countries worldwide. The transition from first symptoms to acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) is highly likely to be due to uncontrolled cytokine release. There is an urgent need to identify 
safe and effective drugs for treatment. Chloroquine (CQ) exhibits a promising inhibitory effect. However, the 
clinical use of CQ can cause severe side effects. We propose that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which exhibits an 
antiviral effect highly similar to that of CQ, could serve as a better therapeutic approach. HCQ is likely to 
attenuate the severe progression of COVID-19, inhibiting the cytokine storm by suppressing T cell activation. It 
has a safer clinical profile and is suitable for those who are pregnant. It is cheaper and more readily available in 
China. We herein strongly urge that clinical trials are performed to assess the preventive effects of HCQ in both 
disease infection and progression.

Abstract BACKGROUNDChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and 
reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients. We evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine on respiratory 
viral loads.PATIENTS AND METHODSFrench Confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in a single arm 
protocol from early March to March 16th, to receive 600mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and their viral load in 
nasopharyngeal swabs was tested daily in a hospital setting. Depending on their clinical presentation, 
azithromycin was added to the treatment. Untreated patients from another center and cases refusing the 
protocol were included as negative controls. Presence and absence of virus at Day6-post inclusion was 
considered the end point.RESULTSSix patients were asymptomatic, 22 had upper respiratory tract infection 
symptoms and eight had lower respiratory tract infection symptoms. Twenty cases were treated in this study 
and showed a significant reduction of the viral carriage at D6-post inclusion compared to controls, and much 
lower average carrying duration than reported of untreated patients in the literature. Azithromycin added to 
hydroxychloroquine was significantly more efficient for virus elimination.CONCLUSIONDespite its small 
sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load 
reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.

Abstract Recent publications have brought attention to the possible benefit of chloroquine, a broadly used antimalarial 

drug, in the treatment of patients infected by the novel emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The scientific 
community should consider this information in light of previous experiments with chloroquine in the field of 
antiviral research.

Abstract At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, and has quickly 

spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries around the world, leading to a serious situation for 
epidemic prevention. So far, there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine 
phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including anti-coronavirus. Here we found that 
treating the patients diagnosed as novel coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success 
rate of treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide and regulate the use of 
chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter collaboration group of Department 
of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for 
chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive 
discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg twice per day for 10 days for patients 
diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications 
to chloroquine.

Abstract An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has posed 

significant threats to international health and the economy. In the absence of specific treatment for this virus, 
there is an urgent need to learn from the experience and lessons in China. To reduce the case-fatality rate 
among COVID-19 patients, we should not ignore the complications, such as RNAaemia, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, and multiple organ dysfunction. To help understand the advantages and limitations of 
differential treatments, we provide a timely review and discuss the complications and corresponding major 
treatments, especially controversial ones such as antiviral therapy (remdesivir, ribavirin, chloroquine), 
glucocorticoid therapy, extracorporeal support including an artificial liver system (ALS) and extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation (ECMO), based on available evidence. As a result, we suggest that antiviral therapy and 
organ function support are vital to reduce mortality for mild patients and critical patients, respectively. This

Abstract Rapid diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics are important interventions for the management of the 2019 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak. It is timely to systematically review the potential of these 
interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for 
research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, 
Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google 
Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several 
laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing 
Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as 
point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates 
are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of 
novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against 
the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have 
been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or 
drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.

Abstract The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously provisionally 
named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19) in China at the end of 2019 has caused a 
large global outbreak and is a major public health issue. As of 11 February 2020, data from the World Health 
Organization (WHO) have shown that more than 43 000 confirmed cases have been identified in 28 countries/
regions, with >99% of cases being detected in China. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 as the 
sixth public health emergency of international concern. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to two bat-derived 
severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is spread by 
human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact, and infection has been estimated to have mean 
incubation period of 6.4 days and a basic reproduction number of 2.24-3.58. Among patients with pneumonia 
caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus pneumonia or Wuhan pneumonia), fever was the most common 
symptom, followed by cough. Bilateral lung involvement with ground-glass opacity was the most common 
finding from computed tomography images of the chest. The one case of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA is 
responding well to remdesivir, which is now undergoing a clinical trial in China. Currently, controlling infection 
to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary intervention being used. However, public health authorities 
should keep monitoring the situation closely, as the more we can learn about this novel virus and its associated 
outbreak, the better we can respond.

Abstract Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious, rapidly spreading viral disease with an 

alarming case fatality rate up to 5%. The risk factors for severe presentations are concentrated in patients with 
chronic kidney disease, particularly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis dependent. 
We report the first US case of a 56-year-old nondiabetic male with ESRD secondary to IgA nephropathy 
undergoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis for 3 years, who developed COVID-19 infection. He has 
hypertension controlled with angiotensin receptor blocker losartan 100 mg/day and coronary artery disease 
status-post stent placement. During the first 5 days of his febrile disease, he presented to an urgent care, 3 
emergency rooms, 1 cardiology clinic, and 2 dialysis centers in California and Utah. During this interval, he 
reported nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and low-grade fevers but was not suspected of COVID-19 infection until 
he developed respiratory symptoms and was admitted to the hospital. Imaging studies upon admission were 
consistent with bilateral interstitial pneumonia. He was placed in droplet-eye precautions while awaiting 
COVID-19 test results. Within the first 24 h, he deteriorated quickly and developed acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS), requiring intubation and increasing respiratory support. Losartan was withheld due to 
hypotension and septic shock. COVID-19 was reported positive on hospital day 3. He remained in critical 
condition being treated with hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab in addition to the standard medical 
management for septic shock and ARDS. Our case is unique in its atypical initial presentation and highlights the 
importance of early testing.

Abstract The World Health Organization has now launched the SOLIDARITY trial to investigate four potential 

treatments: remdesivir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine; lopinavir and ritonavir; and lopinavir and ritonavir 
plus interferon-β.1 The trial will not be double blind, as WHO said it needed to find a balance between gold 
standard research practice and speed, but it will include thousands of patients from several countries. While it 
has previously been tested in vitro against a number of viruses, including SARS, and found to inhibit growth, no 
benefit has been seen in animal models.3 In a limited way, the drug has been tested against SARS-CoV-2—the 
cause of covid-19—and has reportedly been found "highly effective," although the evidence is still limited, with 
much of the data unpublished.45 Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath, 
said that while the early results are "promising" they have "yet to be fully scrutinised, and, of course, it is 
essential to conduct other, larger controlled trials to determine accurately the effectiveness of chloroquine as a 
treatment for covid-19. [...]chloroquine has subtle effects on a wide variety of immune cells. Ian Hall, professor 
of molecular medicine at the University of Nottingham, said, "The idea behind the trial is that by giving more of 
this molecule to the lung it could help reduce the severity of infection with covid-19, especially in those people 
who have reduced immune responses to the virus.

Abstract At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused an outbreak in Wuhan, and has quickly 

spread to all provinces in China and 26 other countries around the world, leading to a serious situation for 
epidemic prevention. So far, there is still no specific medicine. Previous studies have shown that chloroquine 
phosphate (chloroquine) had a wide range of antiviral effects, including anti-coronavirus. Here we found that 
treating the patients diagnosed as novel coronavirus pneumonia with chloroquine might improve the success 
rate of treatment, shorten hospital stay and improve patient outcome. In order to guide and regulate the use of 
chloroquine in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, the multicenter collaboration group of Department 
of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province and Health Commission of Guangdong Province for 
chloroquine in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia developed this expert consensus after extensive 
discussion. It recommended chloroquine phosphate tablet, 500mg twice per day for 10 days for patients 
diagnosed as mild, moderate and severe cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and without contraindications 
to chloroquine.

Abstract Background: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first described in 2012 and 
attracted a great international attention due to multiple healthcare associated outbreaks. The disease carries a 
high case fatality rate of 34.5%, and there is no internationally or nationally recommended therapy. 
Method(s): We searched MEDLINE, Science Direct, Embase and Scopus databases for relevant papers 
published till March 2019 describing in vitro, in vivo or human therapy of MERS. 
Result(s): Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 from Embase, and 4 from Science 
Direct. Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, 30 articles were included in the final review and 
comprised: 22 in vitro studies, 8 studies utilizing animal models, 13 studies in humans, and one study included 
both in vitro and animal model. There are a few promising therapeutic agents on the horizon. The combination 
of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b showed excellent results in common marmosets and currently is 
in a randomized control trial. Ribavirin and interferon were the most widely used combination and experience 
comes from a number of observational studies. Although, the data are heterogenous, this combination might be 
of potential benefit and deserve further investigation. There were no randomized clinical trials to recommend 
specific therapy for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection. Only one such study is planned for randomization 
and is pending completion. The study is based on a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-beta- 1b. A 
fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) was safe and well tolerated in healthy individuals and this agent 
may deserve further testing for efficacy. 
Conclusion(s): Despite multiple studies in humans there is no consensus on the optimal therapy for MERS-CoV. 
Randomized clinical trials are needed and potential therapies should be evaluated only in such clinical trials. In 
order to further enhance the therapeutic aroma for MERS-CoV infection, repurposing old drugs against MERS-
CoV is an interesting strategy and deserves further consideration and use in clinical settings.

Abstract Coronaviruses (CoVs) act as cross-species viruses and have the potential to spread rapidly into new host species 
and cause epidemic diseases. Despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), there are currently no drugs available for 
their treatment; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are urgently needed. To 
search for effective inhibitory agents, we performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of a 2,000-compound 
library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds using the established genetically 
engineered human CoV OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strain expressing Renilla luciferase (rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc) and 
validated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro. We screened 56 hits from the HTS data 
and validated 36 compounds in vitro using wild-type HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, we identified seven 
compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, 
and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four 
CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. Additionally, we found that emetine blocked MERS-CoV entry 
according to pseudovirus entry assays and that lycorine protected BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced 
lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This represents the first demonstration of in 
vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor the effect of lycorine on the spread and distribution of 
HCoV-OC43 in a mouse model. These results offer critical information supporting the development of an 
effective therapeutic strategy against CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Currently, there is no approved therapy to 
treat coronavirus infection; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed. 
Based on our high-throughput screening assay using a compound library, we identified seven compounds with 
broad-spectrum efficacy against the replication of four CoVs in vitro. Additionally, one compound (lycorine) was 
found to protect BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central 
nervous system. This inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting novel CoV 
infections in the future.

Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an emerging threat to public health 
worldwide by causing severe respiratory disease in humans with high virulence and case fatality rate (about 
35%) since 2012. Little is known about the pathogenesis and innate antiviral response in primary human 
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and dendritic cells (MDDCs) upon MERS-CoV infection. In this study, 
we assessed MERS-CoV replication as well as induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in MDMs 
and immature and mature MDDCs. Immature MDDCs and MDMs were permissive for MERS-CoV infection, 
while mature MDDCs were not, with stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine upregulation in 
MDMs, but not in MDDCs. To further evaluate the antiviral activity of well-defined drugs in primary antigen 
presenting cells (APCs), three compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine and toremifine), each with broad-
spectrum antiviral activity in immortalized cell lines, were evaluated in MDMs and MDDCs to determine their 
antiviral effect on MERS-CoV infection. While chloroquine was not active in these primary cells, 
chlorpromazine showed strong anti-MERS-CoV activity, but it was associated with high cytotoxicity narrowing 
the potential window for drug utilization. Unlike in established cells, toremifene had marginal activity when 
tested in antigen presenting cells, with high apparent cytotoxicity, also limiting its potential as a therapeutic 
option. These results demonstrate the value of testing drugs in primary cells, in addition to established cell lines, 
before initiating preclinical or clinical studies for MERS treatment and the importance of carefully assessing 
cytotoxicity in drug screen assays. Furthermore, these studies also highlight the role of APCs in stimulating a 
robust protective immune response to MERS-CoV infection.

Abstract Introduction: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an important emerging 

respiratory pathogen. MERS-CoV resulted in multiple hospital outbreaks within and outside the Arabian 
Peninsula. The disease has a high case fatality rate, with the need for a therapeutic option. Areas covered: In this 
review, we provide an overview of the progress in the development of therapeutic strategies for MERS. We 
searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar, using the following terms: 'MERS', 'MERS-
CoV', 'Middle East respiratory syndrome' in combination with 'treatment' or 'therapy'. Expert commentary: 
There are multiple agents tried in vitro and in vivo. None of these agents were used in large clinical studies. 
Available clinical studies are limited to the use of the combination of interferon and other agents. These clinical 
studies are based solely on case reports and case series. There are no prospective or randomized trials. There is 
a need to have prospective and randomized clinical trials for the therapy of MERS-CoV. However, this strategy 
might be hampered by the sporadic cases outside the large hospital outbreaks.

Abstract Emerging viruses such as HIV, dengue, influenza A, SARS coronavirus, Ebola, and other viruses pose a significant 
threat to human health. Majority of these viruses are responsible for the outbreaks of pathogenic lethal 
infections. To date, there are no effective therapeutic strategies available for the prophylaxis and treatment of 
these infections. Chloroquine analogs have been used for decades as the primary and most successful drugs 
against malaria. Concomitant with the emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium strains and a 
subsequent decrease in the use as antimalarial drugs, other applications of the analogs have been investigated. 
Since the analogs have interesting biochemical properties, these drugs are found to be effective against a wide 
variety of viral infections. As antiviral action, the analogs have been shown to inhibit acidification of endosome 
during the events of replication and infection. Moreover, immunomodulatory effects of analogs have been 
beneficial to patients with severe inflammatory complications of several viral diseases. Interestingly, one of the 
successful targeting strategies is the inhibition of HIV replication by the analogs in vitro which are being tested 
in several clinical trials. This review focuses on the potentialities of chloroquine analogs for the treatment of 
endosomal low pH dependent emerging viral diseases.

Abstract Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory system caused by the 
new betacoronavirus (MERS coronavirus, MERS-CoV), which shows high mortality rates. The typical symptoms 
of MERS are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and it is often accompanied by pneumonia. The MERS-CoV 
was introduced to Republic of Korea in May 2015 by a patient returning from Saudi Arabia. The disease spread 
mostly through hospital infections, and by the time the epidemic ended in August, the total number of 
confirmed diagnoses was 186, among which 36 patients died. Reflecting the latest evidence for antiviral drugs 
in the treatment of MERS-CoV infection and the experiences of treating MERS patients in Republic of Korea, 
these guidelines focus on antiviral drugs to achieve effective treatment of MERS-CoV infections.

Abstract Coronaviruses can cause respiratory and enteric disease in a wide variety of human and animal hosts. The 2003 
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences 
of zoonotic coronavirus infections in humans. In 2012, a similar previously unknown coronavirus emerged, 
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), thus far causing over 650 laboratory-confirmed 
infections, with an unexplained steep rise in the number of cases being recorded over recent months. The 
human MERS fatality rate of ∼ 30% is alarmingly high, even though many deaths were associated with 
underlying medical conditions. Registered therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus infections are not 
available. Moreover, the pace of drug development and registration for human use is generally incompatible 
with strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, we have screened a library of 348 FDA-
approved drugs for anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell culture. If such compounds proved sufficiently potent, their 
efficacy might be directly assessed in MERS patients. We identified four compounds (chloroquine, 
chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in the low-micromolar range (50% 
effective concentrations [EC(50)s], 3 to 8 μM). Moreover, these compounds also inhibit the replication of SARS 
coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E. Although their protective activity (alone or in combination) remains 
to be assessed in animal models, our findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with 
zoonotic coronaviruses like MERS-CoV. Although they may not necessarily reduce viral replication to very low 
levels, a moderate viral load reduction may create a window during which to mount a protective immune 
response.

Abstract Outbreaks of emerging infections present health professionals with the unique challenge of trying to select 
appropriate pharmacologic treatments in the clinic with little time available for drug testing and development. 
Typically, clinicians are left with general supportive care and often untested convalescent-phase plasma as 
available treatment options. Repurposing of approved pharmaceutical drugs for new indications presents an 
attractive alternative to clinicians, researchers, public health agencies, drug developers, and funding agencies. 
Given the development times and manufacturing requirements for new products, repurposing of existing drugs 
is likely the only solution for outbreaks due to emerging viruses. In the studies described here, a library of 290 
compounds was screened for antiviral activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-
CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Selection of compounds for inclusion in 
the library was dependent on current or previous FDA approval or advanced clinical development. Some drugs 
that had a well-defined cellular pathway as target were included. In total, 27 compounds with activity against 
both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were identified. The compounds belong to 13 different classes of 
pharmaceuticals, including inhibitors of estrogen receptors used for cancer treatment and inhibitors of 
dopamine receptor used as antipsychotics. The drugs identified in these screens provide new targets for in vivo 
studies as well as incorporation into ongoing clinical studies. Copyright © 2014, American Society for

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in late 2002 and was controlled in July 2003 by public 

health measures. Its causative agent, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) jumped from an animal reservoir to humans 
and has the potential to re-emerge. Since then, the world has seen another virus that emerged in 2009, the 
pandemic influenza A (H1N1)v virus. Following the sequencing of the genetic code of SARS-CoV and the 
deciphering of some of the functions of its proteins, including the cellular receptors and host proteins that 
participate in the life cycle of the virus, promising lead drugs and new uses of old drugs have been discovered. 
Engineered monoclonal antibodies have surmounted the hurdle of provoking antibody enhancement as well as 
providing broad coverage against various SARS-CoV strains and mutants to prevent viral escape. Protease 
inhibitors are favored small molecule inhibitors because of possible broad spectrum coverage as well as the 
ability to be formulated for oral use. RNAi-based therapeutics produced impressive in vitro data and is rapid to 
develop. Interferon and chloroquine are likely to be effective as nonspecific antivirals with a good safety profile. 
The development of SARS-CoV anti-infectives is ongoing and will undoubtedly strengthen the infrastructure 
and know-how in the field of antiviral drug discovery. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers.

Abstract Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens of the order Nidovirales. Several new members 

were discovered following the emergence of SARS-CoV in human populations, including two human 
coronaviruses and several animal coronaviruses. They cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses and have 
been found in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis. The high mortality of SARS, the identification of a 
natural reservoir, and the well-founded fear of provoking antibody-enhanced disease as a result of vaccination 
fueled the ongoing efforts in anti-coronavirus drug discovery. This review presents the results of current

Abstract Until recently, human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as HCoV strain OC43 (HCoV-OC43), were mainly known to 
cause 15 to 30% of mild upper respiratory tract infections. In recent years, the identification of new HCoVs, 
including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, revealed that HCoVs can be highly pathogenic and 
can cause more severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. To 
date, no specific antiviral drugs to prevent or treat HCoV infections are available. We demonstrate that 
chloroquine, a widely used drug with well-known antimalarial effects, inhibits HCoV-OC43 replication in 
HRT-18 cells, with a 50% effective concentration (+/- standard deviation) of 0.306 +/- 0.0091 microM and a 
50% cytotoxic concentration (+/- standard deviation) of 419 +/- 192.5 microM, resulting in a selectivity index of 
1,369. Further, we investigated whether chloroquine could prevent HCoV-OC43-induced death in newborn 
mice. Our results show that a lethal HCoV-OC43 infection in newborn C57BL/6 mice can be treated with 
chloroquine acquired transplacentally or via maternal milk. The highest survival rate (98.6%) of the pups was 
found when mother mice were treated daily with a concentration of 15 mg of chloroquine per kg of body 
weight. Survival rates declined in a dose-dependent manner, with 88% survival when treated with 5 mg/kg 
chloroquine and 13% survival when treated with 1 mg/kg chloroquine. Our results show that chloroquine can 
be highly effective against HCoV-OC43 infection in newborn mice and may be considered as a future drug 
against HCoVs.

Abstract The human coronaviruses (HCoV) OC43 and 229E are common causes of upper respiratory tract infections. 
Severe diseases were rare, however, until the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV 
in 2003. Since then, other novel CoV (NL63 and HKU1) have been described, and they have caused respiratory 
infections worldwide. Potentially exposed laboratory workers or animal handlers with rapidly progressive 
pneumonia not responding to standard antibacterial coverage must be isolated with contact and droplet, and 
for specific situations, airborne precautions, till rapid tests of respiratory and faecal samples are negative for 
SARS-CoV. Generally, the viral loads collected at different anatomical sites correlate with the severity of 
symptoms and mortality. Shedding of SARS-CoV peaks at day 10 after the onset of symptoms, which 
theoretically allows ample time for antiviral treatment. The disease is characterized by uncontrolled replication 
of the virus and a prominent pro-inflammatory response. No randomized controlled trials with a specific anti-
coronavirus agent have been conducted with respect to therapy or prophylaxis. Reports using historical 
matched controls have suggested that treatment with interferon alfacon-1 (a synthetic interferon) combined 
with steroid, protease inhibitors together with ribavirin, or convalescent plasma containing neutralizing 
antibody, could be useful. Prophylaxis with interferon or hyperimmune globulin may be considered for 
unprotected exposure. The role of immunomodulators to decrease excessive inflammation remains elusive. 
Other non-SARS-CoV infections are generally milder in immunocompetent hosts, and scientific data on antiviral 
treatment of these viruses are scarce. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of

Abstract The antiviral effects of chloroquine (CQ) on human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) infection of human fetal 

lung cell line, L132 are reported. CQ significantly decreased the viral replication at concentrations lower than in 
clinical usage. We demonstrated that CQ affects the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase

CPE induced by HCoV-229E infection and viral replication. Our findings suggest that CQ affects the activation

Abstract Change to the overall glycosylation profile of viral glycoproteins have been shown to be advantageous to virus 

survival and virulence. Many human viral pathogens rely on specific oligosaccharides to evade detection by the 
host immune system. Viruses such as HIV, Hendra, SARS-CoV, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis 
and West Nile virus rely on N-linked and O-Linked glycosylation for critical functions such as entry into host

Abstract Before the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, only 12 
other animal or human coronaviruses were known. The discovery of this virus was soon followed by the 
discovery of the civet and bat SARS-CoV and the human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1. Surveillance of 
coronaviruses in many animal species has increased the number on the list of coronaviruses to at least 36. The 
explosive nature of the first SARS epidemic, the high mortality, its transient reemergence a year later, and 
economic disruptions led to a rush on research of the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, immunological, 
virological, and other basic scientific aspects of the virus and the disease. This research resulted in over 4,000 
publications, only some of the most representative works of which could be reviewed in this article. The marked 
increase in the understanding of the virus and the disease within such a short time has allowed the development 
of diagnostic tests, animal models, antivirals, vaccines, and epidemiological and infection control measures, 
which could prove to be useful in randomized control trials if SARS should return. The findings that horseshoe 
bats are the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV-like virus and that civets are the amplification host highlight the 
importance of wildlife and biosecurity in farms and wet markets, which can serve as the source and 
amplification centers for emerging infections. Copyright © 2007, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights

Abstract Chloroquine (CQ) and its hydroxyl analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) are weak bases with a half-century long 

use as antimalarial agents. Apart from this antimalarial activity, CQ and HCQ have gained interest in the field of 
other infectious diseases. One of the most interesting mechanisms of action is that CQ leads to alkalinisation of 
acid vesicles that inhibit the growth of several intracellular bacteria and fungi. The proof of concept of this 
effect was first used to restore intracellular pH allowing antibiotic efficacy for Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q 
fever, and doxycycline plus HCQ is now the reference treatment for chronic Q fever. There is also strong 
evidence of a similar effect in vitro against Tropheryma whipplei, the agent of Whipple's disease, and a clinical 
trial is in progress. Other bacteria and fungi multiply in an acidic environment and encouraging in vitro data 
suggest that this concept may be generalised for all intracellular organisms that multiply in an acidic 
environment. For viruses, CQ led to inhibition of uncoating and/or alteration of post-translational modifications 
of newly synthesised proteins, especially inhibition of glycosylation. These effects have been well described in 
vitro for many viruses, with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being the most studied. Preliminary in vivo 
clinical trials suggest that CQ alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs might represent an interesting 
way to treat HIV infection. In conclusion, our review re-emphasises the paradigm that activities mediated by 
lysosomotropic agents may offer an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases 
worldwide. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

Abstract Since the mid 60's the human coronaviruses (HCoV), represented by HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, were 
generally considered relatively harmless viruses. This status changed dramatically with the emergence of SARS-
CoV in 2002/2003. The SARS-CoV pandemic took 774 lives around the globe and infected more than 8000 
people in 29 countries. SARS-CoV is believed to be of zoonotic origin, transmitted from its natural reservoir in 
bats through several animal species (e.g., civet cats, raccoon dogs sold for human consumption in markets in 
southern China). The epidemic was halted in 2003 by a highly effective global public health response, and SARS-
CoV is currently not circulating in humans. The outbreak of SARS-CoV and the danger of its re-introduction into 
the human population, as well as the danger of the emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections triggered 
an intense survey for an efficient treatment that resulted in the evaluation of several anticoronaviral 
compounds. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were identified shortly after the SARS-CoV outbreak. The 4 human 
coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 cause mild respiratory illnesses when 
compared to SARS, but these infections are involved in 10 - 20 % of hospitalizations of young children and 
immunocompromised adults with respiratory tract illness. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a successful 
therapy to prevent disease induction or a vaccine to prevent new infections. This review summarizes the 
current status of anticoronaviral strategies. © 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

Abstract Compounds approved for therapeutic use and in vitro inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were evaluated for inhibition in the mouse SARS-CoV replication model. A hybrid 
interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon (IFN) 
inducer, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124), were the only compounds that potently inhibited virus titres in the lungs 
of infected mice as assessed by CPE titration assays. When mice were dosed intraperitoneally (i.p.) with IFN-
alpha B/D once daily for 3 days beginning 4 h after virus exposure, SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of infected 
mice was reduced by 1 log10 at 10,000 and 32,000 IU; at the highest dose of 100,000 IU, virus lung titres were 
below detectable limits. Ampligen used i.p. at 10 mg/kg 4 h prior to virus exposure also reduced virus lung titres 
to below detectable limits. Nelfinavir, beta-D-N4-hydroxycytidine, calpain inhibitor VI, 3-deazaneplanocin A 
and Alferon (human leukocyte IFN-alpha-n3) did not significantly reduce lung virus titres in mice. Anti-
inflammatory agents, chloroquine, amodiaquin and pentoxifylline, were also inactive in vivo, suggesting that 
although they may be useful in ameliorating the hyperinflammatory response induced by the virus infection, 
they will not significantly reduce the replication of the virus, the inducer of inflammatory response. Thus, anti-
inflammatory agents may only be useful in treating virus lung infections if used in combination with agents that 
inhibit virus replication. In summary, the data suggest that induction of IFN by mismatched dsRNA or actual 
treatment with exogenous IFN-alpha can inhibit SARS-CoV replication in the lungs of mice.

Abstract Coronavirus replication offers several attractive targets for chemotherapy. These include: viral entry (inhibited 

by chloroquine and peptides); viral RNA (targeted by antisense approaches/RNAi); the main protease 3CLpro 
(inhibited by peptidic molecules such as HIV-1 protease inhibitors and miscellaneous compounds); the 
accessory protease(s) PLpro(s) (inhibited by zinc ions); RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (inhibited by 
aurintricarboxylic acid and antisense approaches); and helicase (inhibited by bananins). Chloroquine and HIV-1 
protease inhibitors (with well-known toxicity profiles) should be considered for clinical tests if severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS) re-emerges; however, there are other attractive compounds. Lessons should be 
learnt from AIDS research for choosing the best strategies. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.

Abstract Coronaviruses may cause respiratory, enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species, including 

humans. Until recently, the relatively low burden of disease in humans caused by few of these viruses hampered 
development of coronavirus specific therapeutics. However, the emergence of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has prompted the discovery of such drugs. Subsequent studies in animal 
models demonstrated the efficacy of SARS-CoV specific monoclonal antibodies, pegylated-interferon-alpha and 
siRNAs against SARS-CoV. Furthermore, several antivirals shown to be effective against other viruses were 
tested in vitro. Because of availability and shown efficacy, the use of interferons may be considered should 
SARS-CoV or a related coronavirus (re)-emerge. The more recent design of wide-spectrum inhibitors targeting 
the coronavirus main proteases may lead to the discovery of new antivirals against multiple coronavirus 
induced diseases. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a life-threatening infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV. In the 

2003 outbreak, it infected more than 8,000 people worldwide and claimed the lives of more than 900 victims. 
The high mortality rate resulted, at least in part, from the absence of definitive treatment protocols or 
therapeutic agents. Although the virus spreading has been contained, due preparedness and planning, including 
the successful development of antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV, is necessary for possible reappearance of 
SARS. In this review, we have discussed currently available strategies for antiviral drug discovery and how these 
technologies have been utilized to identify potential antiviral agents for the inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. 
Moreover, progress in the drug development based on different molecular targets is also summarized, including 
1) Compounds that block the S protein-ACE2-mediated viral entry; 2) Compounds targeting SARS-CoV Mpro; 3) 
Compounds targeting papain-like protease 2 (PLP2); 4) Compounds targeting SARS-CoV RdRp; 5) Compounds 
targeting SARS-CoV helicase; 6) Active compounds with unspecified targets; and 7) Research on siRNA. This 
review aims to provide a comprehensive account of drug discovery on SARS. The experiences with the SARS 
outbreak and drug discovery would certainly be an important lesson for the drug development for any new viral 
outbreaks that may emerge in the future. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

Abstract Three ferroquine (FQ) derivatives, closely mimicking the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have 

been prepared. Whereas these organometallic compounds provide the expected reduced cytotoxic effects 
compared to FQ, they inhibit in vitro growth of Plasmodium falciparum far better than chloroquine (CQ). 
Moreover, this new class of bioorganometallic compounds exert antiviral effects with some selectivity toward 
SARS-CoV infection. These new drugs may offer an interesting alternative for Asia where SARS originated and 
malaria has remained endemic.

Abstract There are a number of antivirals as well as antiviral strategies that could be envisaged to prevent or treat severe 

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (or similar) coronavirus (CoV) infections. Targets for the prophylactic or 
therapeutic interventions include interaction of the spike (S) glycoprotein (S1 domain) with the host cell 
receptor, fusion of the S2 domain with the host cell membrane, processing of the replicase polyproteins by the 
virus-encoded proteases (3C-like cysteine protease [3CLpro] and papain-like cysteine protease) and other 
virus-encoded enzymes such as the NTPase/helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Human 
monoclonal antibody blocking S1 may play an important role in the immunoprophylaxis of SARS. Fusion 
inhibitors reminiscent of enfuvirtide in the case of HIV may also be developed for SARS-CoV. Various 
peptidomimetic and nonpeptidic inhibitors of 3CLpro have been described, the best ones inhibiting SARS-CoV 
replication with a selectivity index greater than 1000. Human interferons, in particular alpha- and beta-
interferon, as well as short interfering RNAs could further be pursued for the control of SARS. Various other 
compounds, often with an ill-defined mode of action but selectivity indexes up to 100, have been reported to 
exhibit in vitro activity against SARS-CoV: valinomycin, glycopeptide antibiotics, plant lectins, hesperetin, 
glycyrrhizin, aurintricarboxylic acid, chloroquine, niclosamide, nelfinavir and calpain inhibitors.

Abstract BACKGROUNDSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-
CoV). No effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available.RESULTSWe report, however, 
that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are 
observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both 
prophylactic and therapeutic advantage. In addition to the well-known functions of chloroquine such as 
elevations of endosomal pH, the drug appears to interfere with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This may negatively influence the virus-receptor binding and abrogate the 
infection, with further ramifications by the elevation of vesicular pH, resulting in the inhibition of infection and 
spread of SARS CoV at clinically admissible concentrations.CONCLUSIONChloroquine is effective in 
preventing the spread of SARS CoV in cell culture. Favorable inhibition of virus spread was observed when the 
cells were either treated with chloroquine prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the indirect 
immunofluorescence assay described herein represents a simple and rapid method for screening SARS-CoV 
antiviral compounds.

Abstract A new disease, the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-
CoV), emerged at the beginning of 2003 and rapidly spread throughout the world. Although the disease had 
disappeared in June 2003 its re-emergence cannot be excluded. The development of vaccines against SARS-
CoV may take years. Therefore, the availability of effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV may be crucial for 
the control of future SARS outbreaks. In this review, experimental and clinical data about potential anti-SARS 
drugs is summarised and discussed. Animal model studies will be needed to help to determine which 
interventions warrant controlled clinical testing. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Abstract In 2003, an outbreak of a novel respiratory virus exploded from mainland China Into an international issue, 
catching the world by surprise. The ensuing challenges to hospital and public health workers rose to a level 
never before seen in healthcare, in part due to the unknown nature of the disease, the fear of the human-to-
human transmission and the significant media involvement. A new coronavirus was identified as the causative 
agent and named the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated virus. A number of antiviral and anti-
inflammatory treatment strategies were explored during the epidemic, with varying success. Following the 
epidemic, in vitro antiviral analyses of numerous compounds have been conducted. This review summarizes 
treatment agents assessed during and after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, with the aim 
of guiding future decision makers should the virus return. © 2005 Future Drug Ltd.

Abstract We report on chloroquine, a 4-amino-quinoline, as an effective inhibitor of the replication of the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in vitro. Chloroquine is a clinically approved drug effective 
against malaria. We tested chloroquine phosphate for its antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-induced 
cytopathicity in Vero E6 cell culture. Results indicate that the IC50 of chloroquine for antiviral activity (8.8 +/- 
1.2 microM) was significantly lower than its cytostatic activity; CC50 (261.3 +/- 14.5 microM), yielding a 
selectivity index of 30. The IC50 of chloroquine for inhibition of SARS-CoV in vitro approximates the plasma 
concentrations of chloroquine reached during treatment of acute malaria. Addition of chloroquine to infected 
cultures could be delayed for up to 5h postinfection, without an important drop in antiviral activity. 
Chloroquine, an old antimalarial drug, may be considered for immediate use in the prevention and treatment of 
SARS-CoV infections.

Abstract Chloroquine is a 9-aminoquinoline known since 1934. Apart from its well-known antimalarial effects, the drug 

has interesting biochemical properties that might be applied against some viral infections. Chloroquine exerts 
direct antiviral effects, inhibiting pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses including members of 
the flaviviruses, retroviruses, and coronaviruses. Its best-studied effects are those against HIV replication, 
which are being tested in clinical trials. Moreover, chloroquine has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing the 
production/release of tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6, which mediate the inflammatory 
complications of several viral diseases. We review the available information on the effects of chloroquine on 
viral infections, raising the question of whether this old drug may experience a revival in the clinical 
management of viral diseases such as AIDS and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which afflict mankind in the 
era of globalisation.
