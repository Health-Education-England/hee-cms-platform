Abstract Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), one of the main circulating HCoVs worldwide, causes respiratory tract 

illnesses like runny nose, cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Recently, a severe respiratory illness outbreak of 
HCoV-NL63 has been reported in a long-term care facility. Sambucus FormosanaNakai, a species of elderberry, 
is a traditional medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and antiviral potential. The study investigated the 
antiviral activity of Sambucus FormosanaNakai stem ethanol extract and some phenolic acid constituents 
against HCoV-NL63. The extract was less cytotoxic and concentration-dependently increased anti-HCoV-NL63 
activities, including cytopathicity, sub-G1 fraction, virus yield (IC50 = 1.17 μg/ml), plaque formation 
(IC50 = 4.67 μg/ml) and virus attachment (IC50 = 15.75 μg/ml). Among the phenolic acid constituents in 
Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and gallic acid sustained the anti-HCoV-NL63 
activity that was ranked in the following order of virus yield reduction: caffeic acid 
(IC50 = 3.54 μM) > chlorogenic acid (IC50 = 43.45 μM) > coumaric acid (IC50 = 71.48 μM). Caffeic acid significantly 
inhibited the replication of HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner, and specifically blocked virus 
attachment (IC50 = 8.1 μM). Therefore, the results revealed that Sambucus Formosana Nakai stem ethanol 
extract displayed the strong anti-HCoV-NL63 potential; caffeic acid could be the vital component with anti-
HCoV-NL63 activity. The finding could be helpful for developing antivirals against HCoV-NL63.

Abstract AV-001 is a dietary supplement; it is used as a throat and nose spray composed of natural ingredients, including 

Sambucus nigra (European elder) and eucalyptus with 1, 8-cineole. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
antiviral activity of AV-001 against the pathogenic viruses human influenza A viruses H1N1 and H7N9, 
respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and adenovirus. Antiviral activity was evaluated by 
reduction of the viral-induced cytopathic effect; AV-001 was assessed against a challenge virus in suspension, 
inoculated onto host cells, and assayed for infectious viral load.AV-001 inactivated human influenza A viruses 
H1N1 and H7N9, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and human coronavirus, by 37.17 Log10, 36.42 Log10, 
34.72 Log10, 34.35 Log10 and 33.92 Log10, respectively. Thus, AV-001 exhibited strong and broad-spectrum 
antiviral activities and may represent an effective treatment or preventive agent for respiratory viral infection 
by inactivating the viruses upon their entry into the body.

Abstract BACKGROUNDInfectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a pathogenic chicken coronavirus. Currently, vaccination 
against IBV is only partially protective; therefore, better preventions and treatments are needed. Plants 
produce antimicrobial secondary compounds, which may be a source for novel anti-viral drugs. Non-cytotoxic, 
crude ethanol extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots, Nigella sativa seeds, and Sambucus nigra fruit were tested for 
anti-IBV activity, since these safe, widely used plant tissues contain polyphenol derivatives that inhibit other 
viruses.RESULTSDose-response cytotoxicity curves on Vero cells using trypan blue staining determined the 
highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each plant extract. To screen for IBV inhibition, cells and virus were 
pretreated with extracts, followed by infection in the presence of extract. Viral cytopathic effect was assessed 
visually following an additional 24 h incubation with extract. Cells and supernatants were harvested separately 
and virus titers were quantified by plaque assay. Variations of this screening protocol determined the effects of 
a number of shortened S. nigra extract treatments. Finally, S. nigra extract-treated virions were visualized by 
transmission electron microscopy with negative staining.Virus titers from infected cells treated with R. rosea 
and N. sativa extracts were not substantially different from infected cells treated with solvent alone. However, 
treatment with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by four orders of magnitude at a multiplicity of infection 
(MOI) of 1 in a dose-responsive manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by six orders of magnitude 
and pretreatment of virus was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition. Electron microscopy of 
virions treated with S. nigra extract showed compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles, 
which suggested a mechanism of action.CONCLUSIONSThese results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can 
inhibit IBV at an early point in infection, probably by rendering the virus non-infectious. They also suggest that 
future studies using S. nigra extract to treat or prevent IBV or other coronaviruses are warranted.

Abstract Vaccination against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a pathogenic chicken coronavirus, is not wholly effective. 

The secondary compounds of plants may provide better treatments or preventions against IBV. Crude ethanol 
extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots, Nigella sativa seeds, and Sambucus nigra fruit were tested for anti-IBV activity. 
Cells and virus were pretreated with the highest possible non-cytotoxic dose of individual plant extracts, 
followed by infection in the presence of extract. Cells and supernatants were harvested separately following an 
additional 24h incubation with extract. Virus titers from infected cells treated with R. rosea and N. sativa 
extracts were not substantially different from infected cells treated with solvent alone. However, treatment 
with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by three orders of magnitude at an MOI of 1 in a dose-responsive 
manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by seven orders of magnitude and pretreatment of virus 
alone was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition. Electron microscopy of virions treated with S. 
nigra extract showed compromised envelopes and the presence of membrane vesicles, suggesting a mechanism 
of action. These results demonstrate that S. nigra can inhibit IBV at an early point in infection. Future studies 
will address the factors, in addition to pre-treatment of virus, that are necessary for full virus inhibition. Overall 
these studies identified a plant extract with previously unknown effects against IBV and could potentially lead 
to effective treatments or prevention of this or similar coronaviruses.

Abstract Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated disease of domestic and exotic felides infected with 
feline coronavirus. FIP is characterized by the overexpression of an acute phase protein, the alpha1-acid 
glycoprotein (AGP). In humans, AGP is a heavily glycosylated protein that undergoes several modifications of its 
glycan moiety during acute and chronic inflammatory pathologies. We studied the changes in AGP glycosylation 
in the course of FIP. Specifically, we focussed our attention on the degree of sialylation, fucosylation and 
branching. This study presents a purification method for feline AGP (fAGP) from serum, using an ion exchange 
chromatography strategy. The glycosylation pattern was analyzed in detail by means of interaction of purified 
fAGP with specific lectins. In particular, Sambucus nigra agglutinin I and Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectins 
were used to detect sialic acid residues, Aleuria aurantia lectin was used to detect L-fucose residues and 
Concanavalin A was used to evaluate the branching degree. By this method we showed that fAGP did not 
present any L-fucose residues on its surface, and that its branching degree was very low, both in normal and in 
pathological conditions. In contrast, during FIP disease, fAGP underwent several modifications in the sialic acid 
content, including decreased expression of both alpha(2-6)-linked and alpha(2-3)-linked sialic acid (76 and 44%, 
respectively when compared to non-pathological feline AGP).

Abstract One hundred methanolic plant extracts were screened for antiviral activity against seven viruses. Twelve 

extracts were found to have antiviral activity at the non-cytotoxic concentrations tested. The extracts of Rosa 
nutkana and Amelanchier alnifolia, both members of the Rosaceae, were very active against an enteric 
coronavirus. A root extract of another member of the Rosaceae, Potentilla arguta, completely inhibited 
respiratory syncytial virus. A Sambucus racemosa branch tip extract was also very active against respiratory 
syncytial virus while the inner bark extract of Oplopanax horridus partially inhibited this virus. An extract of 
Ipomopsis aggregata demonstrated very good activity against parainfluenza virus type 3. A Lomatium 
dissectum root extract completely inhibited the cytopathic effects of rotavirus. In addition to these, extracts 
prepared from the following plants exhibited antiviral activity against herpesvirus type 1: Cardamine angulata, 
Conocephalum conicum, Lysichiton americanum, Polypodium glycyrrhiza and Verbascum thapsus.
