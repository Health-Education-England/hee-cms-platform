Abstract ImportanceVirus infection has been widely described as one of the most common causes of myocarditis. 

However, less is known about the cardiac involvement as a complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.ObjectiveTo describe the presentation of acute myocardial inflammation 
in a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who recovered from the influenzalike syndrome and 
developed fatigue and signs and symptoms of heart failure a week after upper respiratory tract 
symptoms.Design, Setting, and ParticipantThis case report describes an otherwise healthy 53-year-old woman 
who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the cardiac care unit in March 2020 for acute 
myopericarditis with systolic dysfunction, confirmed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the week after 
onset of fever and dry cough due to COVID-19. The patient did not show any respiratory involvement during 
the clinical course.ExposureCardiac involvement with COVID-19.Main Outcomes and MeasuresDetection of 
cardiac involvement with an increase in levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and 
high-sensitivity troponin T, echocardiography changes, and diffuse biventricular myocardial edema and late 
gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.ResultsAn otherwise healthy 53-year-old 
white woman presented to the emergency department with severe fatigue. She described fever and dry cough 
the week before. She was afebrile but hypotensive; electrocardiography showed diffuse ST elevation, and 
elevated high-sensitivity troponin T and NT-proBNP levels were detected. Findings on chest radiography were 
normal. There was no evidence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Based on the 
COVID-19 outbreak, a nasopharyngeal swab was performed, with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 on real-time 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed increased 
wall thickness with diffuse biventricular hypokinesis, especially in the apical segments, and severe left 
ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%). Short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping 
sequences showed marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema, and there was also diffuse late 
gadolinium enhancement involving the entire biventricular wall. There was a circumferential pericardial 
effusion that was most notable around the right cardiac chambers. These findings were all consistent with acute 
myopericarditis. She was treated with dobutamine, antiviral drugs (lopinavir/ritonavir), steroids, chloroquine, 
and medical treatment for heart failure, with progressive clinical and instrumental stabilization.Conclusions and 
RelevanceThis case highlights cardiac involvement as a complication associated with COVID-19, even without 
symptoms and signs of interstitial pneumonia.

Abstract The outbreak of the new coronavirus infections COVID-19 in December 2019 in China has quickly become a 
global health emergency. Given the lack of specific anti-viral therapies, the current management of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly supportive, even though several compounds are 
now under investigation for the treatment of this life-threatening disease. COVID-19 pandemic is certainly 
conditioning the treatment strategy of a complex disorder as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whose infectious risk is 
increased compared to the general population because of an overall impairment of immune system typical of 
autoimmune diseases combined with the iatrogenic effect generated by corticosteroids and 
immunosuppressive drugs. However, the increasing knowledge about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 
infection is leading to consider some anti-rheumatic drugs as potential treatment options for the management 
of COVID-19. In this review we will critically analyse the evidences on either positive or negative effect of drugs 
commonly used to treat RA in this particular scenario, in order to optimize the current approach to RA patients.

Abstract BACKGROUNDSince December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) 
occurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China. This study aimed to clarify the characteristics of 
patients with refractory COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective single-center study, we included 155 
consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1st to 
February 5th. The cases were divided into general and refractory COVID-19 groups according to the clinical 
efficacy after hospitalization, and the difference between groups were compared.RESULTSCompared with 
general COVID-19 patients (45.2%), refractory patients had an older age, male sex, more underlying 
comorbidities, lower incidence of fever, higher levels of maximum temperature among fever cases, higher 
incidence of breath shortness and anorexia, severer disease assessment on admission, high levels of neutrophil, 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein, lower levels of 
platelets and albumin, and higher incidence of bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion (P<0.05). Refractory 
COVID-19 patients were more likely to receive oxygen, mechanical ventilation, expectorant, and adjunctive 
treatment including corticosteroid, antiviral drugs and immune enhancer (P<0.05). After adjustment, those 
with refractory COVID-19 were also more likely to have a male sex and manifestations of anorexia and fever on 
admission, and receive oxygen, expectorant and adjunctive agents (P<0.05) when considering the factors of 
disease severity on admission, mechanical ventilation, and ICU transfer.CONCLUSIONNearly 50% COVID-19 
patients could not reach obvious clinical and radiological remission within 10 days after hospitalization. The 
patients with male sex, anorexia and no fever on admission predicted poor efficacy.

Abstract Currently there is no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which frequently leads to fatal 

inflammatory responses and acute lung injury. Here, we discuss the various mechanisms of SARS-CoV-mediated 
inflammation. We also assume that SARS-CoV-2 likely shares similar inflammatory responses. Potential 
therapeutic tools to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses include various methods to block 
FcR activation. In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block 
FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe 
lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. 
However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS CoV-2) that began in December 2019 
presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international 
community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease.METHODSEpidemiological, clinical 
features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in 
northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study.RESULTSA total of 135 hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (IQR 36-55), and there was no significant gender 
difference (53.3% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three 
(31.9%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6%]), diabetes (12 [8.9%]), 
cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9%]), 
cough (102 [76.5%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5%]). Chest CT scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass 
opacity in the lungs of all of the patients. All of the patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100%] (Kaletra and 
interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7%]). In addition, 
many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (124 [91.8%]). It is suggested that patients should receive 
Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of western and Chinese medicine. Compared with the 
mild cases, the severe cases had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, D-dimer, LDH, 
PCT, ALB, CRP, and AST.CONCLUSIONIn this study, the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients 
were demonstrated. Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine played an important role in the treatment of the 
viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine in 
the treatment of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Abstract The 2019 Novel Corona virus infection (COVID 19) is an ongoing public health emergency of international 

significance. There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation 
tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has 
witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission 
patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. 
There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications 
like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity 
and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor 
prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, 
Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis 
is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, 
with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still 
inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of 
suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of 
asymptomatic contacts is recommended. To conclude, controlling this highly transmissible disease requires 
international co-ordination.

Abstract Since December 2019, COVID-19 has occurred unexpectedly and emerged as a health problem worldwide. 
Despite the rapidly increasing number of cases in subsequent weeks, the clinical characteristics of pediatric 
cases are rarely described. A cross-sectional multicenter study was carried out in 10 hospitals across Hubei 
province. A total of 25 confirmed pediatric cases of COVID-19 were collected. The demographic data, 
epidemiological history, underlying diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological data, 
treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. Of 25 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the boy to girl ratio was 
1.27:1. The median age was 3 years. COVID-19 cases in children aged <3 years, 3.6 years, and ≥6-years patients 
were 10 (40%), 6 (24%), and 9 (36%), respectively. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever 
(13 [52%]), and dry cough (11 [44%]). Chest CT images showed essential normal in 8 cases (33.3%), unilateral 
involvement of lungs in 5 cases (20.8%), and bilateral involvement in 11 cases (45.8%). Clinical diagnoses 
included upper respiratory tract infection (n=8), mild pneumonia (n=15), and critical cases (n=2). Two critical 
cases (8%) were given invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and immunoglobulin. The symptoms in 
24 (96%) of 25 patients were alleviated and one patient had been discharged. It was concluded that children 
were susceptible to COVID-19 like adults, while the clinical presentations and outcomes were more favorable 
in children. However, children less than 3 years old accounted for majority cases and critical cases lied in this 
age group, which demanded extra attentions during home caring and hospitalization treatment.

Abstract Available animal and cell line models have suggested that specific therapeutics might be effective in treating 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). We conducted a systematic review of evidence for treatment with 
pharmacologic and supportive therapies. We developed a protocol and searched 5 databases for studies 
describing treatment of MERS and deaths in MERS patients. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed by using ROBINS-I 
tool. We retrieved 3,660 unique citations; 20 observational studies met eligibility, and we studied 13 therapies. 
Most studies were at serious or critical RoB; no studies were at low RoB. One study, at moderate RoB, showed 
reduced mortality rates in severe MERS patients with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; no other studies 
showed a significant lifesaving benefit to any treatment. The existing literature on treatments for MERS is 
observational and at moderate to critical RoB. Clinical trials are needed to guide treatment decisions.

Abstract BACKGROUNDA novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei province 
of China was isolated in January 2020. This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyze the 
clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this 
outbreak.METHODSClinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory 
departments of the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 
2019 to January 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, 
laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens.RESULTSNone of the 137 patients (61 
males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, median age 57 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan 
Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), 
and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, 
including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white 
blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with 
most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; 
ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective 
drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some 
critically ill patients according to their conditions. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant 
benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of 
death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance 
of initial symptoms to dyspnea.CONCLUSIONSThe majority of patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia present 
with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on 
chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory 
failure and may have a poorer prognosis.

Abstract BACKGROUNDCoronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), one of the causes of the common cold, exacerbates chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and 
β2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by 
infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication 
and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown.METHODSPrimary human nasal (HNE) 
and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E.RESULTSPretreatment of HNE and 
HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the 
HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E 
RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-β. 
Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2'2'-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells 
with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory 
effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol 
reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear 
factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with 
cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic 
endosomes.CONCLUSIONSThese findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of 
glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor 
expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the 
airway.

Abstract With the expanding use of molecular assays, viral pathogens are increasingly recognized among critically ill 
adult patients with community-acquired severe respiratory illness; studies have detected respiratory viral 
infections (RVIs) in 17-53% of such patients. In addition, novel pathogens including zoonotic coronaviruses like 
the agents causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and 
the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) are still being identified. Patients with severe RVIs requiring ICU care 
present typically with hypoxemic respiratory failure. Oseltamivir is the most widely used neuraminidase 
inhibitor for treatment of influenza; data suggest that early use is associated with reduced mortality in critically 
ill patients with influenza. At present, there are no antiviral therapies of proven efficacy for other severe RVIs. 
Several adjunctive pharmacologic interventions have been studied for their immunomodulatory effects, 
including macrolides, corticosteroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, sirolimus, statins, anti-influenza immune 
plasma, and vitamin C, but none is recommended at present in severe RVIs. Evidence-based supportive care is 
the mainstay for management of severe respiratory viral infection. Non-invasive ventilation in patients with 
severe RVI causing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and pneumonia is associated with a high likelihood of 
transition to invasive ventilation. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive 
care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe RVI. There is a 
need for more pragmatic and efficient designs to test different therapeutics both individually and in 
combination.

Abstract BACKGROUND:BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 
2012, the virus had caused a high case fatality rate. The clinical presentation of MERS varied from 
asymptomatic to severe bilateral pneumonia, depending on the case definition and surveillance strategies. 
There are few studies examining the mortality predictors in this disease. In this study, we examined clinical 
predictors of mortality of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection. 
METHODS:METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of symptomatic admitted patients to a large tertiary MERS-CoV 
center in Saudi Arabia over the period from April 2014 to March 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were 
collected and analysis was done using a binary regression model. 
RESULTS:RESULTS: A total of 314 symptomatic MERS-CoV patients were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 48 
(±17.3) years. Of these cases, 78 (24.8%) died. The following parameters were associated with increased 
mortality, age, WBC, neutrophil count, serum albumin level, use of a continuous renal replacement therapy 
(CRRT) and corticosteroid use. The odd ratio for mortality was highest for CRRT and corticosteroid use (4.95 
and 3.85, respectively). The use of interferon-ribavirin was not associated with mortality in this cohort. 
CONCLUSION:CONCLUSION: Several factors contributed to increased mortality in this cohort of MERS-CoV patients. Of 
these factors, the use of corticosteroid and CRRT were the most significant. Further studies are needed to 
evaluate whether these factors were a mark of severe disease or actual contributors to higher mortality.

Abstract PURPOSE: Clarify the indication,timing and dosage of steroid used in ARDS due to viral pneumonia. Pulsed 
methylprednisolone dosage should be 0.5-1g daily. 
METHOD(S): By literature review on papers on viral pneumonia, including influenza and SARS coronavirus 
pneumonia from 2001 to 2011,the indication and the correct steroid usage in ARDS is summarized. P<0.05 is 
clinically significant.Descriptive studies is included in SARS scenario. 
RESULT(S): In viral pneumonia, steroid decreases the cytokines, but prolongs vthe viral replication period. 
Beneficial effect is shown in varicella pneumonia with decreased hospital stay,but in H1N1infected patients, a 
trend of increasing hospital-acquired pneumonia!, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital 
mortality,especially in patients receiving early steroid therapy.Case studies showed corticosteroid in severe flu 
pneumonia is beneficial in organizing pneumonia,post-viral inflammatory pneumonitis and H1N1 pneumonia in 
pregnant women.In SARS,nasopharyngeal aspirate reviewed viral load peaked at 10 days(early viral phase) from 
symptom onset.The late excessive inflammatory response started 8-14 days from onset with raised 
IL6,8,16,TNF alpha. Steroid usage should be given by D7 for ARDS, 1day before the late inflammatory response 
phase.High-dose steroid was associated with aspergillosis,avascular necrosis,myopathy and polyneuropathy.No 
difference in outcome was observed between patients receiving immunoglobulin/methylprednisolone versus 
no agents in Singapore study.Pulsed methylprednisolone dosage was 0.5-1g/d,that is compatible to the dosage 
used in rheumatological diseases(1g/d for 3d). 
CONCLUSION(S): Pulsed methylprednisolone is given in the late immune-mediated phase as guided by the 
nasopharyngeal aspirate result and blood cytokine levels,in a dose of 0.5-1g/d intravenously. CLINICAL 
IMPLICATIONS: Methylprednisolone more than 1g/d merely clears up the lung shadows quickly,but invites 
avascular necrosis later without change in mortality.

Abstract Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is one of the first coronavirus strains being described. It is linked to 
common cold symptoms in healthy adults. Younger children and the elderly are considered vulnerable to 
developing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). In particular, immunocompromised patients have been 
reported with severe and life-threatening LRTIs attributed to HCoV-229E. We report for the first time a case of 
LRTI and acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in a healthy adult with no comorbidities and 
HCoV-229E strain identified as the only causative agent. A 45-year-old female with a clear medical history 
presented with fever, cough, and headache. Respiratory tract infection was diagnosed, and empirical antibiotics 
were started. Within two days, she developed bilateral pleural effusions, diffuse consolidations, and ground 
glass opacities involving all lung fields. She needed immediate oxygen supply, while ABGs deteriorated and 
chest imaging and PaO2/FiO2 indicated ARDS. Early administration of systemic corticosteroids led to gradual 
clinical improvement. Multiplex PCR from nasal secretions was positive only for HCoV-229E and negative for 
multiple other pathogens. It remains to be elucidated how an immunocompetent adult developed a life-
threatening LRTI caused by a "benign considered" coronavirus strain, the HCoV-229E.

Abstract RATIONALECorticosteroid therapy is commonly used among critically ill patients with Middle East Respiratory 
Syndrome (MERS), but its impact on outcomes is uncertain. Analyses of observational studies often do not 
account for patients' clinical condition at the time of corticosteroid therapy initiation.OBJECTIVESTo 
investigate the association of corticosteroid therapy on mortality and on MERS coronavirus RNA clearance in 
critically ill patients with MERS.METHODSICU patients with MERs were included from 14 Saudi Arabian 
centers between September 2012 and October 2015. We performed marginal structural modeling to account 
for baseline and time-varying confounders.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTSOf 309 patients, 151 
received corticosteroids. Corticosteroids were initiated at a median of 3.0 days (quartile 1 [Q1]-Q3, 1.0-7.0) 
from ICU admission. Patients who received corticosteroids were more likely to receive invasive ventilation (141 
of 151 [93.4%] vs. 121 of 158 [76.6%]; P < 0.0001) and had higher 90-day crude mortality (112 of 151 [74.2%] 
vs. 91 of 158 [57.6%]; P = 0.002). Using marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not 
significantly associated with 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.07; 
P = 0.12) but was associated with delay in MERS coronavirus RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% 
CI, 0.17-0.72; P = 0.005).CONCLUSIONSCorticosteroid therapy in patients with MERS was not associated with 
a difference in mortality after adjustment for time-varying confounders but was associated with delayed MERS 
coronavirus RNA clearance. These findings highlight the challenges and importance of adjusting for baseline 
and time-varying confounders when estimating clinical effects of treatments using observational studies.

Abstract Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a novel viral respiratory disease caused by MERS-Coronavirus 

(MERS-CoV), and the first reported case was in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There is no specific treatment for MERS, 
and it ranges from supportive treatment to antiviral treatment like interferon (IFN) a 1a, IFN b 1a, and ribavirin. 
We conducted a systematic search on ten databases Studies published after 1/1/2012 and reporting 
information about treatment of MERS-CoV infection were included in our review. We used Mann-Whitney U, 
Chi2 and Fisher's exact tests to investigate the relation between the mortality outcome and independent 
variables. Classification tree model was used to find the best predictors of the mortality. We included 16 papers 
including ten case reports, two case series, and four observational studies. Despite receiving treatment with 
ribavirin plus IFN, the mortality rate was as high as 71% of 68 patients in IFN-treatment group and exactly the 
same (71% of 48 patients) in patients who received supportive treatment only. There was a significant 
difference between died and survived patients in chronic respiratory disease (CRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), 
hypertension, renal replacement therapy and ventilation. Indicating that having CRD, hypertension or DM and 
being ventilated increase the risk of mortality (for all of these factors). While there was no significant difference 
between died and survived patients in gender, ribavirin, corticosteroid, oseltamivir, IFN beta 1a, IFN alpha 2b, 
IFN alpha 2a, congestive heart failure (CHF), other comorbidities (p less than 0.05). There was a significant 
difference between died and survived patient in age, being older in died patients, and time from admission to 
antiviral treatment start being larger in died patients as well (p less than 0.05). The IFN treatment has shown no 
efficacy over supportive treatment only. Antiviral treatment delay, older age group, and co-morbidities 
preexistence (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, dialysis dependent) were associated with 
worse outcome.

Abstract There have been 2040 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-
CoV) in 27 countries, with a mortality rate of 34.9 %. There is no specific therapy. The current therapies have 
mainly been adapted from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) treatments, including broad-
spectrum antibiotics, corticosteroids, interferons, ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir or mycophenolate mofetil, and 
have not been subject to well-organized clinical trials. The development of specific therapies and vaccines is 
therefore urgently required. We examine existing and potential therapies and vaccines from a molecular 
perspective. These include viral S protein targeting; inhibitors of host proteases, including TMPRSS2, cathepsin 
L and furin protease, and of viral M(pro) and the PL(pro) proteases; convalescent plasma; and vaccine 
candidates. The Medline database was searched using combinations and variations of terms, including 'Middle 
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus', 'MERS-CoV', 'SARS', 'therapy', 'molecular', 'vaccine', 'prophylactic', 'S 
protein', 'DPP4', 'heptad repeat', 'protease', 'inhibitor', 'anti-viral', 'broad-spectrum', 'interferon', 'convalescent 
plasma', 'lopinavir ritonavir', 'antibodies', 'antiviral peptides' and 'live attenuated viruses'. There are many 
options for the development of MERS-CoV-specific therapies. Currently, MERS-CoV is not considered to have 
pandemic potential. However, the high mortality rate and potential for mutations that could increase 
transmissibility give urgency to the search for direct, effective therapies. Well-designed and controlled clinical 
trials are needed, both for existing therapies and for prospective direct therapies.

Abstract The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been a focus of international attention 
since its identification in 2012. Epidemiologically it is characterized by sporadic community cases, which are 
amplified by hospital-based outbreaks. Healthcare facilities in 27 countries from most continents have 
experienced imported cases, with the most significant outbreak involving 186 cases in Korea. The mortality 
internationally is 36% and guidance for clinical management has yet to be developed. Most facilities and 
healthcare providers outside of the Middle East receiving patients have no or little experience in the clinical 
management of MERS. When a case does occur there is likely little time for a critical appraisal of the literature 
and putative pharmacological options. We identified published literature on the management of both MERS-
CoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through searches of PubMed and 
WHO and the US CDC websites up to 30 April 2016. A total of 101 publications were retrieved for critical 
appraisal. Most published literature on therapeutics for MERS are in vitro experiments, animal studies and case 
reports. Current treatment options for MERS can be categorized as: immunotherapy with virus-specific 
antibodies in convalescent plasma; polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced in vitro or in genetically 
modified animals; and antiviral agents. The use of any therapeutics in MERS-CoV remains investigational. The 
therapeutic agents with potential benefits and warranting further investigation include convalescent plasma, 
interferon-β/ribavirin combination therapy and lopinavir. Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and 
mycophenolic acid likely have toxicities that exceed potential benefits.

Abstract Learning Objectives: Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 229E and OC43 most commonly cause mild, self-limiting 
upper respiratory infections. Newly identified HCoV species, MERS and SARS, are known to cause acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); however, HCoV OC43 has never been identified as a precipitant for 
ARDS. HCoV 43 can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in severely immunocompromised adults. 
We present a case of HCoV OC43 precipitating ARDS. 
Method(s): A 39 year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus presented with fevers, dyspnea, and 
cough progressing to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Her PaO2 
to FiO2 ratio was 93. Laboratory evaluation was notable for significantly elevated C-reactive protein and mild 
anemia. Chest x-ray revealed dense bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. 
Bronchoscopy showed scant clear secretions, no evidence of hemorrhage. Bronchial alveolar lavage bacterial 
and fungal cultures were sterile as were blood and urine cultures. Viral PCR studies were positive only for 
HCoV OC43. She was treated with lung protective ventilation for 2 days and was successfully extubated with 
complete functional recovery. 
Result(s): Viral precipitants for ARDS are becoming increasingly recognized secondary to improved laboratory 
diagnostic tests. HCoV OC43 has been known to cause lower respiratory tract infections in transplant patients, 
HIV patients, and patients with hematologic malignancies. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is a known 
immunocompromised state traditionally believed to increase host susceptibility to bacterial infections; 
however, with significantly elevated glucoses, cell mediated immunity can additionally be compromised. A 
thorough work-up for viral etiology should be complete for patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and 
unexplained ARDS as it may obviate the need for potentially harmful diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
such as lung biopsies and corticosteroids.

Abstract A 54-year-old man with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was transferred 
to our hospital. We initiated anti-viral drugs and supportive care. The patient's fever and chills disappeared 3 
days after admission and the results of serial follow-up reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing 
for MERS-CoV was negative soon thereafter. He was discharged from the hospital 14 days after admission with 
no symptoms; however, he presented with a fever 7 days after discharge and was re-hospitalized. Chest 
radiographs showed newly developed consolidative opacity. His fever persisted for 3 days after commencing 
empirical antibiotics. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed focal 
patchy airspace consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in a subpleural lesion of the right lower and 
left upper lobes, which was indicative of organizing pneumonia. We initiated empirical corticosteroid treatment 
for this illness, and his fever markedly subsided 1 day later. A chest radiograph showed improvement in the lung 
lesions, and he was discharged from the hospital 10 days after re-admission. The corticosteroid dose was 
gradually tapered over 2 months at the outpatient clinic, and a follow-up CT scan showed complete resolution

Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEWThis article reviews the clinical and treatment aspects of avian influenza viruses and the 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).RECENT FINDINGSAvian influenza A(H5N1) and 
A(H7N9) viruses have continued to circulate widely in some poultry populations and infect humans 
sporadically. Sporadic human cases of avian A(H5N6), A(H10N8) and A(H6N1) have also emerged. Closure of 
live poultry markets in China has reduced the risk of A(H7N9) infection. Observational studies have shown that 
oseltamivir treatment for adults hospitalized with severe influenza is associated with lower mortality and 
better clinical outcomes, even as late as 4-5 days after symptom onset. Whether higher than standard doses of 
neuraminidase inhibitor would provide greater antiviral effects in such patients requires further investigation. 
High-dose systemic corticosteroids were associated with worse outcomes in patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 or 
A(H5N1). MERS-CoV has continued to spread since its first discovery in 2012. The mortality rates are high in 
those with comorbid diseases. There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available. The exact mode of 
transmission from animals to humans remains unknown.SUMMARYThere is an urgent need for developing 
more effective antiviral therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality of these emerging viral respiratory tract 
infections.

Abstract UNLABELLEDIn addition to transporting ions, the multisubunit Na(+),K(+)-ATPase also functions by relaying 
cardiotonic steroid (CTS)-binding-induced signals into cells. In this study, we analyzed the role of Na(+),K(+)-
ATPase and, in particular, of its ATP1A1 α subunit during coronavirus (CoV) infection. As controls, the vesicular 
stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) were included. Using gene silencing, the ATP1A1 protein was 
shown to be critical for infection of cells with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), feline infectious peritonitis virus 
(FIPV), and VSV but not with IAV. Lack of ATP1A1 did not affect virus binding to host cells but resulted in 
inhibited entry of MHV and VSV. Consistently, nanomolar concentrations of the cardiotonic steroids ouabain 
and bufalin, which are known not to affect the transport function of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, inhibited infection of 
cells with MHV, FIPV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and VSV, but not IAV, when the 
compounds were present during virus inoculation. Cardiotonic steroids were shown to inhibit entry of MHV at 
an early stage, resulting in accumulation of virions close to the cell surface and, as a consequence, in reduced 
fusion. In agreement with an early block in infection, the inhibition of VSV by CTSs could be bypassed by low-pH 
shock. Viral RNA replication was not affected when these compounds were added after virus entry. The 
antiviral effect of ouabain could be relieved by the addition of different Src kinase inhibitors, indicating that Src 
signaling mediated via ATP1A1 plays a crucial role in the inhibition of CoV and VSV 
infections.IMPORTANCECoronaviruses (CoVs) are important pathogens of animals and humans, as 
demonstrated by the recent emergence of new human CoVs of zoonotic origin. Antiviral drugs targeting CoV 
infections are lacking. In the present study, we show that the ATP1A1 subunit of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, an ion 
transporter and signaling transducer, supports CoV infection. Targeting ATP1A1 either by gene silencing or by 
low concentrations of the ATP1A1-binding cardiotonic steroids ouabain and bufalin resulted in inhibition of 
infection with murine, feline, and MERS-CoVs at an early entry stage. Infection with the control virus VSV was 
also inhibited. Src signaling mediated by ATP1A1 was shown to play a crucial role in the inhibition of virus entry 
by ouabain and bufalin. These results suggest that targeting the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase using cardiotonic steroids, 
several of which are FDA-approved compounds, may be an attractive therapeutic approach against CoV and 
VSV infections.
