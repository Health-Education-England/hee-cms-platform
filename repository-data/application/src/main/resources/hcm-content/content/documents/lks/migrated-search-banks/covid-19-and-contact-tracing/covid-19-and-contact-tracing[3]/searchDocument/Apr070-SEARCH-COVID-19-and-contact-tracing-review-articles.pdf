Abstract The new outbreak of coronavirus from December 2019 has brought attention to an old viral enemy and has 
raised concerns as to the ability of current protection measures and the healthcare system to handle such a 
threat. It has been known since the 1960s that coronaviruses can cause respiratory infections in humans; 
however, their epidemic potential was understood only during the past two decades.

Abstract In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identiY ed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown 
aetiology linked to the city's South China Seafood Market. Subsequent investigations revealed a novel 
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, as the causative agent now at the heart of a major outbreak. The rising case numbers 
have been accompanied by unprecedented public health action, including the wholesale isolation of Wuhan. 
Alongside this has been a robust scientiY c response, including early publication of the pathogen genome, and 
rapid development of highly speciY c diagnostics. This article will review the new knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 
COVID-19 acute respiratory disease, and summarise its clinical features.

Abstract Emerging pandemics show that humans are not infallible and communities need to be prepared. Coronavirus 
outbreak was Yrst reported towards the end of 2019 and has now been declared a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization. Worldwide countries are responding differently to the virus outbreak. A delay in 
detection and response has been recorded in China, as well as in other major countries, which led to an 
overburdening of the local health systems. On the other hand, some other nations have put in place effective 
strategies to contain the infection and have recorded a very low number of cases since the beginning of the 
pandemics. Restrictive measures like social distancing, lockdown, case detection, isolation, contact tracing, and 
quarantine of exposed had revealed the most efYcient actions to control the disease spreading. This review will 
help the readers to understand the difference in response by different countries and their outcomes. Based on 
the experience of these countries, India responded to the pandemic accordingly. Only time will tell how well 
India has faced the outbreak. We also suggest the future directions that the global community should take to 
manage and mitigate the emergency.

Abstract COVID-19 outbreak was Yrst time experienced in the Wuhan City of China at the end of December 2019. 
Which spread rapidly in China and then worldwide in 209 countries of America, Europe, Australia and Asia 
including Pakistan. There are more than Yfty thousand mortalities and one million plus people have been 
affected worldwide, while Ygure increases rapidly. Different steps have been taken worldwide for the control of 
COVID-19. Even with less resources Pakistan also taken rigorous measures like designed special hospitals, 
Laboratories for testing, quarantine facilities, awareness campaign and lock down to control the spread of virus. 
We highlighted the efforts of government to combat this deadly pneumonia.

Abstract BACKGROUNDIn late December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported an outbreak of pneumonia of 

unknown origin in Wuhan, Hubei Province.SUMMARYA few days later, the genome of a novel coronavirus was 
released (http://viro-logical.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319; Wuhan-Hu-1, GenBank accession No. 
MN908947) and made publicly available to the scientiYc community. This novel coronavirus was provisionally 
named 2019-nCoV, now SARS-CoV-2 according to the Coronavirus Study Group of the International 
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus, 
subgenus Sarbecovirus. Since its discovery, the virus has spread globally, causing thousands of deaths and 
having an enormous impact on our health systems and economies. In this review, we summarize the current 
knowledge about the epidemiology, phylogenesis, homology modeling, and molecular diagnostics of SARS-
CoV-2. Key Messages: Phylogenetic analysis is essential to understand viral evolution, whereas homology 
modeling is important for vaccine strategies and therapies. Highly sensitive and speciYc diagnostic assays are 
key to case identiYcation, contact tracing, identiYcation of the animal source, and implementation of control 
measures.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest global economic and health 
challenge of the century. Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if 
unchecked. One effective and complementary strategy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the 
primary and secondary contacts of conYrmed COVID-19 cases using contact tracing 
technology.OBJECTIVEThe objective of this paper is to survey strategies for digital contact tracing for the 
COVID-19 pandemic and to present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria's data privacy 
regulations.METHODSWe conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing 
implemented around the world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology 
to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while 
adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR).RESULTSDespite the 
potential of digital contact tracing, it always conZicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that 
Nigeria's response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement 
current strategies within the NDPR.CONCLUSIONSOur study shows that mobile position data contact tracing 
is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation 
guidelines will limit data misuse.

Abstract BACKGROUND/PURPOSECurrent studies on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are rare. The 
clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed 
to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children.METHODSWe performed a systematic review in 
PubMed and Embase to Ynd relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the 
journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. 
A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis.RESULTSNine case series were 
included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was 
mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the 
patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are 
asymptomatic. The most common radiographic Ynding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no 
evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most 
relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease.CONCLUSIONCOVID-19 has distinct 
features in children. The disease severity is mild. Current diagnosis is based mainly on typical ground glass 
opacities on chest CT, epidemiological suspicion and contact tracing.

Abstract [...]San Francisco has asked public health professionals to conduct voluntary phone interviews with covid-19 
patients, and they then call anyone that the patient has been in contact with and ask them to quarantine 
themselves for 14 days.1 There are also question marks over how effective digital technology is for contact 
tracing, with a rapid evidence review from an independent research institute published last week warning that 
there was currently no evidence to support the immediate national deployment of contact tracing apps in the 
NHS.2 It said, "The signiYcant technical limitations, and deep social risks, of digital contact tracing outweigh the 
value offered to the crisis response." Anthony Costello, head of the Institute for Global Health at University 
College London and a former WHO director, also appearing at the select committee hearing, said that the UK 
needed to adopt a traditional public health approach to contact tracing, and he suggested that retired clinicians 
could help with contacting people by phone. [...]at the Downing Street press conference on 19 April England’s 
deputy chief medical ofYcer, Jenny Harries, defended the government’s approach and questioned the link 
between low death rates and comprehensive contact tracing.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been identiYed as the cause of an outbreak of 
respiratory illness in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China beginning in December 2019. As of 31 January 2020, this 
epidemic had spread to 19 countries with 11 791 conYrmed cases, including 213 deaths. The World Health 
Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.METHODSA scoping review 
was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. In this scoping 
review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better 
understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus. The research 
domains, dates of publication, journal language, authors' afYliations, and methodological characteristics were 
included in the analysis. All the Yndings and statements in this review regarding the outbreak are based on 
published information as listed in the references.RESULTSMost of the publications were written using the 
English language (89.2%). The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a 
majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over 
time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that 
the virus' origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but speciYc animal associations have not 
been conYrmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, 
and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case 
detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no 
speciYc antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic 
treatment and supportive care.CONCLUSIONSThere has been a rapid surge in research in response to the 
outbreak of COVID-19. During this early period, published research primarily explored the epidemiology, 
causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, as well as prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. 
Although these studies are relevant to control the current public emergency, more high-quality research is 
needed to provide valid and reliable ways to manage this kind of public health emergency in both the short- and 
long-term.

Abstract The need for timely establishment of diagnostic assays arose when Germany was confronted with the Yrst 
travel-associated outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Europe. We 
describe our laboratory experiences during a large contact tracing investigation, comparing previously 
published real-time RT-PCR assays in different PCR systems and a commercial kit. We found that assay 
performance using the same primers and probes with different PCR systems varied and the commercial kit 
performed well.

Abstract A novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) causing a cluster of 
respiratory infections (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, was identiYed on 7 January 
2020. The epidemic quickly disseminated from Wuhan and as at 12 February 2020, 45,179 cases have been 
conYrmed in 25 countries, including 1,116 deaths. Strengthened surveillance was implemented in France on 10 
January 2020 in order to identify imported cases early and prevent secondary transmission. Three categories of 
risk exposure and follow-up procedure were deYned for contacts. Three cases of COVID-19 were conYrmed on 
24 January, the Yrst cases in Europe. Contact tracing was immediately initiated. Five contacts were evaluated as 
at low risk of exposure and 18 at moderate/high risk. As at 12 February 2020, two cases have been discharged 
and the third one remains symptomatic with a persistent cough, and no secondary transmission has been 
identiYed. Effective collaboration between all parties involved in the surveillance and response to emerging 
threats is required to detect imported cases early and to implement adequate control measures.

Abstract A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) causing severe acute respiratory disease emerged recently in Wuhan, China. 
Information on reported cases strongly indicates human-to-human spread, and the most recent information is 
increasingly indicative of sustained human-tohuman transmission. While the overall severity proYle among 
cases may change as more mild cases are identiYed, we estimate a risk of fatality among hospitalised cases at 
14% (95% conYdence interval: 3.9 32%).

Abstract The emergence and reemergence of coronavirus epidemics sparked renewed concerns from global 
epidemiology researchers and public health administrators. Mathematical models that represented how 
contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East 
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control 
interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely 
epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS 
and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used 
in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identiYed in future 
epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological 
models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not 
explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health 
administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required 
data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.

Abstract A scoping search and a systematic literature review were conducted to give an insight on entry and exit 
screening referring to travelers at points of entry, by analyzing published evidence on practices, guidelines, and 
experiences in the past 15 years worldwide. Grey literature, PubMed. and Scopus were searched using speciYc 
terms. Most of the available data identiYed through the systematic literature review concerned entry screening 
measures at airports. Little evidence is available about entry and exit screening measure implementation and 
effectiveness at ports and ground crossings. Exit screening was part of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) 
temporary recommendations for implementation in certain points of entry, for speciYc time periods. Exit 
screening measures for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the three most affected West African countries did not 
identify any cases and showed zero sensitivity and very low speciYcity. The percentages of conYrmed cases 
identiYed out of the total numbers of travelers that passed through entry screening measures in various 
countries worldwide for InZuenza Pandemic (H1N1) and EVD in West Africa were zero or extremely low. Entry 
screening measures for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) did not detect any conYrmed SARS cases in 
Australia, Canada, and Singapore. Despite the ineffectiveness of entry and exit screening measures, authors 
reported several important concomitant positive effects that their impact is difYcult to assess, including 
discouraging travel of ill persons, raising awareness, and educating the traveling public and maintaining 
operation of Zights from/to the affected areas. Exit screening measures in affected areas are important and 
should be applied jointly with other measures including information strategies, epidemiological investigation, 
contact tracing, vaccination, and quarantine to achieve a comprehensive outbreak management response. 
Based on review results, an algorithm about decision-making for entry/exit screening was developed.

Abstract INTRODUCTIONRapid and accurate diagnosis of patients with a new episode of acute dyspnea is a common 

challenge for Primary Care or Emergency Physicians.OBJECTIVETo determine the diagnostic accuracy of signs 
and symptoms in adult patients with a new episode of acute dyspnea presenting to a GP or an Emergency 
Physician (EP).PATIENTS AND METHODSThis was a diagnostic systematic review. Using MEDLINE, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, tracing references, and by contacting 
experts, studies were identiYed on the diagnostic accuracy of additional signs and symptoms in adult patients 
with acute or suddenly worsening dyspnea, presenting to a GP or an EP. Study quality was assessed using 
QUADAS and results were pooled using a random-effects model. Sensitivity, speciYcity, positive and negative 
likelihood ratio (NLR), and positive and negative predictive values for a diagnosis of heart failure (HF) were 
calculated for the combination of acute dyspnea and each additional sign or symptom in the selected 
studies.RESULTSEight of the 24 identiYed studies were carried out in the ED and provided us with all the 
required data, including 4737 patients. All publications reported HF; two studies additionally investigated 
pulmonary embolism, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, acute 
pulmonary infectious diseases, or acute coronary syndrome. The prevalence of HF in patients with acute 
dyspnea ranged from 25 to 59%. Heterogeneity was present in all analyses.Comparing signs and symptoms, 
sensitivity was very poor for the presence of fever (0.05) and sputum production (0.06), and poor for fatigue 
(0.36-0.76), orthopnea (0.2-0.76), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (0.23-0.70), elevated jugular venous pressure 
(0.19-0.70), rales (0.32-0.88), and peripheral edema (0.29-0.77). SpeciYcity was poor for fatigue (0.28-0.69), 
moderate for the presence of fever (0.76-0.88), sputum production (0.73-0.89), orthopnea (0.49-0.92), 
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (0.52-0.93), and rales (0.31-0.98), and good for elevated jugular venous pressure 
(0.75-0.97) and peripheral edema (0.67-0.89).For all other signs and symptoms, sensitivities varied between 
0.20 and 0.43; speciYcities for symptoms varied widely between 0.37 and 0.91 and those of signs between 0.20 
and 1.0.The pooled sensitivities, however, remained poor: below 0.55. Pooled speciYcity of most signs ranged 
between 0.69 and 0.88. The positive likelihood ratio was between 0.64 and 4.11 and the NLR was between 0.59 
and 1.29 with one outlier: rales (pooled NLR=0.35).CONCLUSIONThis systematic review, which only included 
patients from ED settings, did not identify any single sign or symptom that had acceptable sensitivity to be 
useful in ruling out a diagnosis of HF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or pulmonary embolism. 
Elevated jugular venous pressure (0.88, pooled odds ratio: 7), added third heart sound (0.97), and lung 
crepitations (0.77, pooled odds ratio: 11) are useful in ruling in HF.

Abstract BACKGROUNDFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common inherited, potentially deadly disease, 

affecting an estimated 600 000 people in the United States. When FH is undiagnosed and untreated, it is linked 
with early coronary heart disease in more than 50% of men by age 50 years and 30% of women by age 60 years. 
Cascade screening is the most cost effective method available to identify family members with this disease; 
however, cascade screening guidelines do not specify best methods to use when contacting relatives. Therefore, 
I conducted an exhaustive search of the literature to Ynd the most successful communication methods used in 
contact tracing and cascade screening.PURPOSEThe purpose of this summary of the evidence was to identify 
the communication method with greatest impact in having at-risk populations present to a provider for disease 
screening. These Yndings will inform clinicians of the most successful methods to implement when cascade 
screening relatives of known FH patients.CONCLUSIONSMost studies support direct contact of relatives via 
letter, mailed from the provider. Provider-initiated communication more often resulted in relatives being tested 
when compared with other methods of communication.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONSOn the basis of the literature, 
family members of current FH patients will be more likely to present to a provider for cascade screening if they 
receive written communication from the provider.

Abstract The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that causes a severe lower respiratory tract 
infection in humans is now considered a pandemic threat to the Gulf region. Since its discovery in 2012, MERS-
CoV has reached 23 countries affecting about 1100 people, including a dozen children, and claiming over 400 
lives. Compared to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS-CoV appears to kill more people (40% 
versus 10%), more quickly, and is especially more severe in those with pre-existing medical conditions. Most 
MERS-CoV cases (>85%) reported thus far have a history of residence in, or travel to the Middle East. The 
current epidemiology is characterised by slow and sustained transmission with occasional sparks. The 
dromedary camel is the intermediate host of MERS-CoV, but the transmission cycle is not fully understood. In 
this current review, we have brieZy summarised the latest information on the epidemiology, clinical features, 
diagnosis, treatment and prevention of MERS-CoV especially highlighting the knowledge gaps in its 
transmission dynamics, diagnosis and preventive strategy.

Abstract Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions 
remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging 
organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and 
shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response 
capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological 
methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of 
transmission, identiYcation of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health 
laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, 
of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case 
reports, and compared this with data on kinetics of shedding and immune response from published literature on 
other human coronaviruses (hCoVs). We identify and discuss important data gaps, and biases that limit the 
laboratory preparedness to this novel disease. Public health management will beneYt from standardised 
reporting of methods used, details of test outcomes by sample type, sampling date, in relation to symptoms and 
risk factors, along with the currently reported demographic, clinical and epidemiological Yndings.

Abstract In the new millennium, the centuries-old strategy of quarantine is becoming a powerful component of the public 
health response to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. During the 2003 pandemic of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome, the use of quarantine, border controls, contact tracing, and surveillance proved effective 
in containing the global threat in just over 3 months. For centuries, these practices have been the cornerstone 
of organized responses to infectious disease outbreaks. However, the use of quarantine and other measures for 
controlling epidemic diseases has always been controversial because such strategies raise political, ethical, and 
socioeconomic issues and require a careful balance between public interest and individual rights. In a globalized 
world that is becoming ever more vulnerable to communicable diseases, a historical perspective can help clarify 
the use and implications of a still-valid public health strategy.

Abstract While guidelines on contact tracing (CT) after exposure to certain infectious pathogens during air travel exist, 

no guidance documents are available on CT in response to potential exposure on public ground transport. We 
reviewed scientiYc and non-scientiYc literature on transmission of airborne pathogens in public ground 
transport and on factors potentially inZuencing transmission. We identiYed 32 relevant publications (15 
scientiYc and 17 non-scientiYc). Most of the selected studies dealt with transmission of tuberculosis. However, 
the relation between travel duration, proximity to the index case and environmental factors, such as ventilation, 
on disease transmission in public ground transport is poorly understood. Considering the difYculty and 
probably limited effectiveness of CT in ground transport, our results suggest that only exceptional 
circumstances would justify CT. This contrasts with the high level of attention CT in air travel seems to receive 
in international regulations and recommendations. We question whether the indication for CT should be 
revisited after a risk-beneYt assessment that takes into account exposure in both ground and air transport.

Abstract In order to assist national public health authorities in the European Union to assess the risks associated with 
the transmission of infectious agents on board aircrafts, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control initiated in 2007 the RAGIDA project (Risk Assessment Guidance for Infectious Diseases transmitted 
on Aircraft). RAGIDA consists of two parts: the production of a systematic review and a series of disease-
speciYc guidance documents. The systematic review covered over 3,700 peer-reviewed articles and grey 
literature for the following diseases: tuberculosis, inZuenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 
invasive meningococcal disease, measles, rubella, diphtheria, Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers, Lassa 
fever, smallpox and anthrax. In addition, general guidelines on risk assessment and management from 
international aviation boards and national and international public health agencies were systematically 
searched. Experts were interviewed on case-based events by standardised questionnaires. Disease-speciYc 
guidance documents on tuberculosis, SARS, meningococcal infections, measles, rubella, Ebola and Marburg 
haemorrhagic fevers, Lassa fever, smallpox and anthrax were the result of consultations of disease-speciYc 
expert panels. Factors that inZuence the risk assessment of infectious disease transmission on board aircrafts 
and decision making for contact tracing are outlined.

Abstract We describe the public health control measures implemented in Singapore to limit the spread of inZuenza A 

(H1N1-2009) and mitigate its social effects. We also discuss the key learning points from this experience. 
Singapore's public health control measures were broadly divided into 2 phases: containment and mitigation. 
Containment strategies included the triage of febrile patients at frontline healthcare settings, admission and 
isolation of conYrmed cases, mandatory Quarantine Orders (QO) for close contacts, and temperature screening 
at border entry points. After sustained community transmission became established, containment shifted to 
mitigation. Hospitals only admitted H1N1-2009 cases based on clinical indications, not for isolation. Mild cases 
were managed in the community. Contact tracing and QOs tapered off, and border temperature screening 
ended. The 5 key lessons learnt were: (1) Be prepared, but retain Zexibility in implementing control measures; 
(2) Surveillance, good scientiYc information and operational research can increase a system's ability to manage 
risk during a public health crisis; (3) Integrated systems-level responses are essential for a coherent public 
health response; (4) Effective handling of manpower surges requires creative strategies; and (5) 
Communication must be strategic, timely, concise and clear. Singapore's effective response to the H1N1-2009 
pandemic, founded on experience in managing the 2003 SARS epidemic, was a whole-of-government approach 
towards pandemic preparedness planning. Documenting the measures taken and lessons learnt provides a 
learning opportunity for both doctors and policy makers, and can help fortify Singapore's ability to respond to 
future major disease outbreaks.

Abstract The national strategy against pandemic inZuenza essentially consists of 3 prongs: (i) effective surveillance, (ii) 

mitigation of the pandemic's impact, and (iii) render the population immune through vaccination. When the 
pandemic hits Singapore, the response plan aims to achieve the following 3 outcomes: (i) maintenance of 
essential services to limit social and economic disruption, (ii) reduction of morbidity and mortality through 
antiviral treatment, and (iii) slow and limit the spread of inZuenza to reduce the surge on healthcare services. 
The biggest challenge will come from managing the surge of demand on healthcare services. A high level of 
preparedness will help healthcare services better cope with the surge.

Abstract BACKGROUNDPrompt diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome is very 
important.AIMA systematic review was conducted to determine the accuracy of 10 important signs and 
symptoms in selected and non-selected patients.DESIGN OF STUDYDiagnostic meta-analysis.METHODUsing 
MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, tracing references, and by contacting experts, studies were sought out that 
described one of the 10 signs and symptoms on one or both conditions. Studies were excluded if they were not 
based on original data. Validity was assessed using QUADAS and all data were pooled using a random effects 
model.RESULTSSixteen of the 28 included studies were about patients who were non-selected. In this group, 
absence of chest-wall tenderness on palpation had a pooled sensitivity of 92% (95% conYdence interval [CI] = 
86 to 96) for acute myocardial infarction and 94% (95% CI = 91 to 96) for acute coronary syndrome. Oppressive 
pain followed with a pooled sensitivity of 60% (95% CI = 55 to 66) for acute myocardial infarction. Sweating had 
the highest pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR+), namely 2.92 (95% CI = 1.97 to 4.23) for acute myocardial 
infarction. The other pooled LR+ Zuctuated between 1.05 and 1.49. Negative LRs (LR-) varied between 0.98 and 
0.23. Absence of chest-wall tenderness on palpation had a LR- of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.18 to 
0.29).CONCLUSIONSBased on this meta-analysis it was not possible to deYne an important role for signs and 
symptoms in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Only chest-wall 
tenderness on palpation largely ruled out acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome in low-
prevalence settings.

Abstract The emergency department (ED) is an essential component of the public health response plan for control of 
acute respiratory infectious threats. Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of 
dangerous respiratory pathogens, including inZuenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian inZuenza, and 
bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identiYable. Sustaining 
effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, 
inadequate stafYng and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Threat of 
contagion exists not only for ED patients but also for visitors, health care workers, and inpatient populations. 
Potential physical sites for respiratory disease transmission extend from out-of-hospital care, to triage, waiting 
room, ED treatment area, and the hospital at large. This article presents a summary of the most current 
information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, 
and legal issues. Wherever possible, speciYc recommendations and references to practical information from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are provided. The 'Administrative Issues' section describes 
coordination with public health departments, procedures for effective facility planning, and measures for health 
care worker protection (education, stafYng optimization, and vaccination). The patient care section addresses 
the potentially infected ED patient, including emergency medical services concerns, triage planning, and patient 
transport. 'Legal Issues' discusses the interplay between public safety and patient privacy. Emergency 
physicians play a critical role in early identiYcation, treatment, and containment of potentially lethal respiratory 
pathogens. This brief synopsis should help clinicians and administrators understand, develop, and implement 
appropriate policies and procedures to address respiratory hygiene in the ED.

Abstract SARS and travel are intricately interlinked. Travelers belonged to those primarily affected in the early stages of 
the outbreak, travelers became vectors of the disease, and Ynally, travel and tourism themselves became the 
victims. The outbreak of SARS created international anxiety because of its novelty, its ease of transmission in 
certain settings, and the speed of its spread through jet travel, combined with extensive media coverage. The 
psychological impacts of SARS, coupled with travel restrictions imposed by various national and international 
authorities, have diminished international travel in 2003, far beyond the limitations to truly SARS hit areas. 
Governments and press, especially in non SARS affected areas, have been slow to strike the right balance 
between timely and frequent risk communication and placing risk in the proper context. Screening at airport 
entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufYcient in itself. The low yield in detecting SARS is most likely 
due to a combination of factors, such as travel advisories which resulted in reduced travel to and from SARS 
affected areas, implementation of effective pre-departure screening at airports in SARS-hit countries, and a 
rapid decline in new cases at the time when screening was Ynally introduced. Rather than investing in airport 
screening measures to detect rare infectious diseases, investments should be used to strengthen screening and 
infection control capacities at points of entry into the healthcare system. If SARS reoccurs, the subsequent 
outbreak will be smaller and more easily contained if the lessons learnt from the recent epidemic are applied. 
Lessons learnt during the outbreak in relation to international travel will be discussed.

Abstract This paper provides an overview of the Hong Kong government's inZuenza preparedness plan and the key roles 

of public health nurses in that plan. The part played by Hong Kong public health nurses in the management of 
the avian inZuenza outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 and the sudden acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 
2003, together with the capacity-building work they are now undertaking in preparing for an inZuenza 
pandemic, highlight their crucial role in public health. Recent strengthening of public health infrastructure in 
Hong Kong and heightened public awareness of public health issues have facilitated more proactive and 
effective public health nursing activities.

Abstract In Singapore, the military was actively involved in the containment of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) last year. The outbreak started in February 2003 with three Singapore travellers to Hong 
Kong. At that time, nothing was known about the aetiological agent of the atypical pneumonia that was termed 
SARS. Unfortunately one of the travellers was a super-spreader, deYned as a person with high efYciency for 
virus transmission, and was responsible for the expansion of the national outbreak. Not only was the Singapore 
military involved in contact tracing of personnel and enforcement of home quarantine, military-afYliated 
research institutes were also involved in providing diagnostic support. This review reconstructs the events that 
took place during the SARS outbreak, focusing on the special support arising from complementing the military-
afYliated laboratory with the public health laboratory. A description of the diagnostic Yndings is provided in 
chronological order. The review ends with lessons Singapore learnt from the SARS crisis, stressing the 
importance of national preparedness for future outbreaks.

Abstract Recent major disease outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and foot-and-mouth disease in the 
UK, coupled with fears of emergence of human-to-human transmissible variants of avian inZuenza, have 
highlighted the importance of accurate quantiYcation of disease threat when relatively few cases have 
occurred. Traditional approaches to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases deal most effectively with 
large outbreaks in large populations. The desire to elucidate the highly variable dynamics of disease spread 
amongst small numbers of individuals has fuelled the development of models that depend more directly on 
surveillance and contact-tracing data. This signals a move towards a closer interplay between epidemiological 
modelling, surveillance and disease-management strategies.

Abstract In Taiwan, since the Yrst case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identiYed on February 25, 2003, 

a total of 3032 cases of suspected or probable SARS were reported prior to July 5, 2003. Among these cases, 
664 cases were classiYed as probable SARS based on the clinical case deYnitions and 346 had a positive result 
for the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The epidemic in Taiwan could be divided into 2 distinct 
stages. In stage I (late-February to mid-April) patients had traceable contact with infected patients or travel 
histories to known affected areas of SARS. By contrast, patients in stage II (mid-April to June) acquired infection 
via intra-hospital or inter-hospital transmission. The mortality rate directly attributable to SARS during the 2 
stages of the outbreak in Taiwan was 11% (37 patients). Phylogenetic analysis of sequences of SARS-CoV 
strains in Taiwan and other countries showed that Taiwanese strains were closely related to those isolated from 
patients in Hong Kong and Guangdong. The nonspeciYc initial symptoms and signs of the illness, the absence of 
reliable diagnostic tests, as well as the initial lack of strict infection control measures in hospitals and effective 
national control policies contributed to the island-wide spread of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. Development of 
an effective strategy to prepare for future outbreaks will require the implementation of an active coordinated 
clinical reporting system, international collaboration to identify cases in the early stage, development of 
laboratory tools for early diagnosis, a robust system of prepared isolation, and adequate quarantine facilities.

Abstract Close proximity of persons together with handling of human secretions (eg respiratory secretions) make health 
care workers (HCW) particularly vulnerable to transmission of droplet-transmitted respiratory infections. This 
was tragically highlighted during the international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 
2003 with attack rates of more than 50% in HCW. The purpose of this article is to review common airborne and 
droplet-transmitted bacterial and viral respiratory tract infections with regard to their impact on health care 
workers. Lessons need to be learned from the SARS epidemic. The three main strategies to prevent or control 
occupationally acquired infections are relatively simple and cost-effective-droplet and contact precautions and 
for some pathogens also vaccination. Enforced implementation of stringent droplet precautions during the 
SARS crisis should be maintained; and this will most likely have a major additional impact on other nosocomial 
infections. Employee health services should proactively and creatively devise delivery systems that enhance 
compliance with vaccination programs for all health care workers. Hospital surveillance should be expanded to 
all respiratory diseases to facilitate early detection of nosocomial outbreaks, and this should also include 
surveillance of all HCW. Integrated syndromic and virological surveillance systems set up during the SARS 
epidemic will also further our understanding of other respiratory infections in the hospital setting. Even if 
pursuing early diagnosis for unspeciYc respiratory illnesses is expensive, identiYcation of the causative 
organism may reduce unnecessary isolation, contact tracing and anxiety, in particular during an outbreak 
situation. We have a duty to protect our health care workers.

Abstract Objectives: This report aims to describe the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 
Taiwan between March and July 2003, and to examine the public health response. 
Method(s): Surveillance for SARS was initiated on 14 March 2003. Response activities are described for the 
isolation of patients; contact tracing; quarantine of contact persons; fever screening for inbound and outbound 
passengers at the airport; and hospital infection control as assessed by mobile SARS containment teams. 
Result(s): Between 14 March and 30 July 2003 a total of 668 probable cases of SARS were reported. Of the 668 
cases, 181 (27%) were fatal. Compared to the survivors, fatal cases were more likely to be older (p < 0.001), 
male (p < 0.05), exposed through hospital contact (p < 0.001), and have a coexisting medical disorder (p < 0.001). 
Between 28 March and 30 July a total of 151,270 persons were quarantined. Among them, 46 (3.0/10,000) 
were subsequently classiYed as being probable SARS cases. At the time of the mobile team assessments, 46 
(53%) hospitals had implemented WHO infection control recommendations. 
Conclusion(s): In this outbreak, an emergency plan consisted of patient isolation and strict hospital infection 
control. © 2004 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the Yrst severe new infectious disease of this millennium, caused 

widespread public disruption. By July 2003, 8427 probable SARS cases had been reported from 29 countries 
with a case fatality rate of 9.6%. The new febrile respiratory illness spread around the world along the routes of 
international air travel, with outbreaks concentrated in transportation hubs or densely populated areas. The 
etiologic agent was identiYed as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The disease is transmissible person-to-person 
through direct contact, large droplet contact and indirect contact from fomites and unwashed hands. Saudi 
Arabia successfully prevented the entry of the disease by imposing travel restrictions, special entry 
requirements, screening procedures at airports, including temperature checks, and quarantine. Ongoing efforts 
are aimed at developing case investigation, case management and surveillance protocols for SARS.

Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) not only paralysed economic activities in SARS-affected cities, it 

also affected sporting activities, SARS was identiYed in Hong Kong in late February 2003 and the WHO issued a 
global alert on 12 March, 2003. The incubation period of SARS is usually 4-6 days and patients commonly 
present with high fever (temperature >38degreeC), dry cough, chills and rigor, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. 
Although a speciYc antiviral agent and vaccines for SARS are not available at the time of writing, a standard 
treatment protocol for SARS has been developed. The average mortality rate is about 16% in Hong Kong. The 
coronavirus is a common pathogen for upper respiratory tract infection and is the most probable pathogen for 
SARS. Transmission methods may, therefore, be similar for both these infections. Transmission is possible when 
aerosolised viral particles come into contact with the susceptible host's mucous membrane, most commonly the 
nose, but also the mouth and eyes. With appropriate preventive measures to avoid contact with virus, the 
probability of infection is minimal. Isolation of those who have had close contact with conYrmed or suspected 
SARS patients and/or who have persistent fever will be the most effective and practical method of avoiding 
contact. Maintaining personal hygiene and frequent hand washing can also reduce the risk of infection. Using 
diluted bleach (1 part bleach in 99 parts water) to cleanse training areas and equipment is also recommended. 
With proper event planning to conform with quarantine measures, special travel arrangements, facility 
sterilisation and use of venues with good ventilation and Yltering systems, sport competition can still proceed.

Abstract Quarantine was a prominent control strategy used in the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 

outbreaks. The present commentary identiYes useful measures of disease control that warrant an infectious 
outbreak for quarantine and concludes that SARS did not warrant the use of quarantine. In fact, the Toronto 
quarantine was clearly ineffective in identifying potential SARS patients and evidence shows that SARS is not 
infectious during the preclinical phase and does not become signiYcantly infectious until the symptomatic 
illness is well-established. The author states that SARS was an ill-suited infectious disease for quarantine and 
discusses the use of quarantine and recommendations for controlling outbreaks.

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly described respiratory infection with pandemic potential. 
The causative agent is a new strain of coronavirus most likely originating from wild animals. This disease Yrst 
emerged in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. Early in the outbreak the infection had been 
transmitted primarily via household contacts and healthcare settings. In late February 2003 the infection was 
transmitted to Hong Kong when an infected doctor from the mainland visited there. During his stay in Hong 
Kong at least 17 guests and visitors were infected at the hotel at which he stayed. By modern day air travel, the 
infection was rapidly spread to other countries including Vietnam, Singapore and Canada by these infected 
guests. With the implementation of effective control strategies including early isolation of suspected cases, 
strict infection control measures in the hospital setting, meticulous contact tracing and quarantine, the 
outbreak was Ynally brought under control by July 2003. In addition, there were another two events of SARS in 
China between the end of December 2003 and January 2004 and from March to May 2004; both were readily 
controlled without signiYcant patient spread.

Abstract Effective surveillance is necessary for the successful management of emerging infection. It allows public health 
protection measures such as contact tracing and isolation to be put in place. This study aimed to Ynd the most 
appropriate surveillance method for a disease like SARS. Existing surveillance methods were evaluated against 
a set of new criteria in a qualitative manner. InZuenza and tuberculosis (TB) surveillance were used as models. A 
literature search was undertaken to Ynd relevant evidence. The results show that TB surveillance is more 
appropriate than inZuenza surveillance as a model because it is more complete in its reporting. Clinician-based 
reporting is better than laboratory-based because it is more timely. The results suggest a clinician-based 
notiYcation system would be the most appropriate form of surveillance for a disease like SARS for public health 
purposes.

Abstract Smallpox was declared to be eradicated on 8 May 1980, during the Thirty-third World Health Assembly. 
However, concerns about the possible use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism have increased in recent 
years. Governments have responded by initiating selective vaccination programmes and other public health 
measures. This review uses historical data from 20th century outbreaks to assess the risks to current 
populations (which have declining immunity) from a deliberate release of virus. The data presented supports 
the conclusion of a previous reviewer (Mack) that "smallpox cannot be said to live up to its reputation. Far from 
being a quick-footed menace, it has appeared as a plodding nuisance with more bark than bite." Its R value (the 
average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case) is lower than that for measles, human 
parvovirus, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis; only the value for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) is lower. Like SARS, close person-to-person contact is required for effective spread of the disease, and 
exposure to the virus in hospitals has played an important role in transmission for both viruses. In the present 
paper the dangers of mass vaccination are emphasized, along with the importance of case isolation, contact 
tracing, and quarantine of close contacts for outbreak control. The need for rapid diagnosis and the continued 
importance of maintaining a network of electron microscopes for this purpose are also highlighted.

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognised and highly contagious respiratory infection 
caused by a new strain of coronavirus. The disease can result in progressive respiratory failure in adults and the 
mortality rate has been reported to be 8-15%. This infection spreads by droplet transmission and children 
appear to acquire SARS through close household contact exposure to infected adults. Disease severity is, 
however, much milder in the paediatric age group. The common laboratory Yndings in infected children and 
adolescents include lymphopaenia and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine phosphokinase. 
Air space consolidation is commonly seen during the course of the illness although chest radiographs are 
normal on presentation in half of the cases. The pathophysiology of SARS appears to be related to 
immunological dysregulation in response to the coronavirus infection. The optimal treatment of SARS in 
children remains to be determined. No case fatality in infected children has been reported. The early and proper 
isolation of infected adults, meticulous infection control measures in the hospital setting, exhaustive contact 
tracing and quarantine measures are important steps in preventing the spread of the disease among health care 
workers and into the community. The development of a sensitive and rapid test for early diagnosis is underway. 
Further controlled trials are necessary to deYne the optimal treatment of this infection in children. © 2003

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as 

SARS-CoV. The disease has a high propensity to spread to household members and healthcare workers and may 
be associated with transmission and outbreaks in the community. Severe illness in immunocompromised 
patients, sophisticated hospital facilities and treatment procedures, particularly those that generate aerosols, 
and lack of adequate isolation and control measures, can amplify transmission and contribute to so-called 
"super-spreading" events. The presence of non-speciYc clinical manifestations at presentation and a lack of 
validated early diagnostic methods and effective management pose great difYculty for frontline physicians in 
the containment of this disease. The mortality of SARS is in the region of 10 to 15%; the presence of underlying 
disease, high initial C-reactive protein levels, and positive SARS-CoV in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples are 
associated with a higher risk of respiratory failure and mortality. Despite the disappearance of SARS cases 
worldwide, the potential evolution of SARS-CoV in animals suggests the disease may re-emerge in the future. 
Heightened levels of clinical suspicion, rapid case detection and isolation, and contact tracing are essential to 
effective management of future outbreaks. Further ongoing requirements for successful management include 
research on the immunopathogenesis of SARS and the development of timely and reliable diagnostic tests, 
effective antiviral and immunomodulatory agents, and vaccines for the disease.

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new disease that poses a threat to international health. The 
SARS epidemic earlier this year affected more than 30 countries and regions, with a cumulative global total of 
8098 cases. It is caused by a novel coronavirus, probably of animal origin. The mean incubation period is 6.4 
days (range 2-11 days). Patients usually present with high fever, chills, myalgia and dry cough, with or without 
chest X-ray evidence of pneumonia at the onset of disease. A history of contact with or travel to an area with 
local transmission is common. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, as a valid rapid diagnostic test is not yet 
available. There is no speciYc antiviral therapy for this disease, and no controlled clinical trial for any treatment 
modality has been conducted. In several retrospective studies steroids have been shown to be useful in a 
proportion of patients who deteriorated despite antibiotics and supportive treatment. SARS has a high 
morbidity (about 25% required intensive care) and fatality (9.6%). A high index of suspicion for the disease, 
isolation of patients, strict observation of infection control practices and compliance with use of personal 
protective equipment are necessary to prevent nosocomial infection. Contact tracing and quarantine are 
essential measures to prevent community spread of disease. Prevention of future outbreaks requires 
strengthening of infection control practices in hospitals, development of a rapid diagnostic test and a vaccine, 
and removal of any animal reservoir and environmental conditions that led to the spread of the disease.

Abstract The appearance and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on a global level raised vital legal and 
ethical issues. National and international responses to SARS have profound implications for 3 important ethical 
values: privacy, liberty, and the duty to protect the public's health. This article examines, through legal and 
ethical lenses, various methods that countries used in reaction to the SARS outbreak: surveillance and contact 
tracing, isolation and quarantine, and travel restrictions. These responses, at least in some combination, 
succeeded in bringing the outbreak to an end. The article articulates a set of legal and ethical recommendations 
for responding to infectious disease threats, seeking to reconcile the tension between the public's health and 
individual rights to privacy, liberty, and freedom of movement. The ethical values that inform the 
recommendations include the precautionary principle, the least restrictive/intrusive alternative, justice, and 
transparency. Development of a set of legal and ethical recommendations becomes even more essential when, 
as was true with SARS and will undoubtedly be the case with future epidemics, scientiYc uncertainty is 
pervasive and urgent public health action is required.

Abstract Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the Yrst major novel infectious disease to hit the international 
community in the 21st century. It originated in southern China in November 2002, reached Hong Kong in 
February 2003 and spread rapidly thereafter to 29 countries/regions on Yve continents. At the end of the 
epidemic, the global cumulative total was 8098 with 774 deaths. Seven Asian countries/regions were among 
the top ten on the list. Mainland China and Hong Kong, SAR, accounted for 87% of all cases and 84% of all 
deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by a novel coronavirus. It has alarmed the world with its 
infectivity and signiYcant morbidity and mortality, its lack of a rapid, reliable diagnostic test and lack of effective 
speciYc treatment and vaccination. The adverse impact on travel and business around the world, particularly in 
Asia, has been enormous. Some lessons learnt from this epidemic included: (1) any outbreak of infectious 
disease can rapidly spread around the world by air travel; (2) early reporting of the outbreak to neighbouring 
countries/regions and the World Health Organization is essential to prevent international spread; and (3) 
infection control, tracing and quarantine of contacts are essential to control the epidemic. Many questions 
remain unanswered, including the origin and pathogenesis of the novel coronavirus, the natural history and the 
best speciYc treatment of the disease. The SARS-CoV has probably jumped from an animal host to humans. 
There is an urgent need to evaluate the human-animal habitat in southern China and to remove animal 
reservoirs if found.

Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) originated in Southern China in November 2002, and was brought to 

Hong Kong in February 2003. From Hong Kong, the disease spread rapidly worldwide but mostly to Asian 
countries. At the end of the epidemic in June, the global cumulative total was 8422 cases with 916 deaths (case 
fatality rate of 11%). People of all ages were affected, but predominantly females. Health care workers were at 
high risk and accounted for one-Yfth of all cases. Risk factors for death included old age and comorbid illnesses, 
especially diabetes. The disease is caused by a novel coronavirus and is transmitted by droplets or direct 
inoculation from contact with infected surfaces. Contaminated sewage was found to be responsible for the 
outbreak in a housing estate in Hong Kong affecting over 300 residents. The mean incubation period was 6.4 
days (range 2-10). The duration between onset of symptoms and hospitalisation was from 3 to 5 days. The 
relatively prolonged incubation period allowed asymptomatic air travellers to spread the disease globally. The 
number of individuals infected by each case has been estimated to be 2.7. Effective control of nosocomial 
transmission included early detection of disease, strict isolation of patients, practice of droplet and contact 
precautions and compliance with the use of personal protective equipment. Effective control of disease spread 
in the community included tracing and quarantine of contacts. Development of a validated diagnostic test and 
an effective vaccine as well as elimination of possible animal reservoirs are measures needed to prevent 
another epidemic.

Abstract As there are no validated and rapid diagnostic tests nor speciYc treatment for severe acute respiratory 

syndrome (SARS) at the initial stage of the outbreak, public health measures are vital for the control of the 
disease. These included an enhanced disease surveillance system, expanded laboratory diagnostic capacity, 
heightened infection control in hospitals and residential institutions for the elderly, intensive contact tracing 
coupled with medical surveillance at designated medical centres, quarantine of close contacts by way of home 
conYnement, formation of multidisciplinary investigation and response teams, and public education and 
communication. The above measures were implemented in many countries during the outbreak. To prevent 
spread in the region and beyond, port health measures targeted at both entry and exit health screenings were 
also carried out together with regional and international liaison.

Abstract Since November 2002 an epidemic of a new severe respiratory infection has taken place primarily in South-East 

Asia. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is assumed caused by a recently identiYed corona virus, which 
seems to be a new pathogen in the human population. The infection is assumed transferred primarily with 
droplets and is highly contagious within healthcare settings and families. Respiratory and barrier precautions 
are necessary to contain the virus, as it is contact tracing.
