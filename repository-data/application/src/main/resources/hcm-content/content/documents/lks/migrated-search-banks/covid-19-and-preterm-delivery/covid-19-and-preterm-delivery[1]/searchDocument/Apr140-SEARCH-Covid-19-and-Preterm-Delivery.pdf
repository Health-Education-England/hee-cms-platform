Abstract:BACKGROUNDThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global public health emergency. Data on the 
effect of COVID-19 in pregnancy are limited to small case series.OBJECTIVESTo evaluate the clinical 
characteristics and outcomes in pregnancy and the vertical transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 
infection.STUDY DESIGN: Clinical records were retrospectively reviewed for 116 pregnant women 
with COVID-19 pneumonia from 25 hospitals in China between January 20 and March 24, 2020. 
Evidence of vertical transmission was assessed by testing for SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord 
blood, and neonatal pharyngeal swab samples.RESULTSThe median gestational age on admission 
was 38+0 (IQR 36+0-39+1) weeks. The most common symptoms were fever (50.9%, 59/116) and 
cough (28.4%, 33/116); 23.3% (27/116) patients presented without symptoms. Abnormal radiologic 
findings were found in 96.3% (104/108) of cases. There were eight cases (6.9%, 8/116) of severe 
pneumonia but no maternal deaths. One of eight patients (1/8) that presented in the first- and early-
second-trimester had a missed spontaneous abortion. Twenty-one of 99 patients (21.2%, 21/99) that 
had delivered had preterm birth, including six with preterm premature ruptured of membranes. The 
rate of spontaneous preterm birth before 37 weeks was 6.1% (6/99). There was one case of severe 
neonatal asphyxia that resulted in neonatal death. Eighty-six of the 100 neonates that had testing for 
SARS-CoV-2 had negative results, of these ten neonates had paired amniotic fluid and cord blood 
samples that were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.CONCLUSIONSSARS-CoV-2 infection during 
pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and spontaneous 
preterm birth. There is no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the 
infection manifests during the third-trimester of pregnancy.

Abstract:BACKGROUNDFew case reports and clinical series exist on pregnant women infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 who delivered.OBJECTIVETo review the available information on mode of delivery, 
vertical/peripartum transmission, and neonatal outcome in pregnant women infected with SARS-
CoV-2.SEARCH STRATEGYCombination of the following key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and 
pregnancy in Embase and PubMed databases.SELECTION CRITERIAPapers reporting cases of women 
infected with SARS-CoV-2 who delivered.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISThe following was 
extracted: author; country; number of women; study design; gestational age at delivery; selected 
clinical maternal data; mode of delivery; selected neonatal outcomes.MAIN RESULTSIn the 13 
studies included, vaginal delivery was reported in 6 cases (9.4%; 95% CI, 3.5-19.3). Indication for 
cesarean delivery was worsening of maternal conditions in 31 cases (48.4%; 95% CI, 35.8-61.3). Two 
newborns testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR assay were reported. In three 
neonates, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM levels were elevated but the RT-PCR test was 
negative.CONCLUSIONSThe rate of vertical or peripartum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is low, if any, 
for cesarean delivery; no data are available for vaginal delivery. Low frequency of spontaneous 
preterm birth and general favorable immediate neonatal outcome are reassuring.

Abstract:BackgroundThe newly identified 2019-nCoV, which appears to have originated in Wuhan, 
the capital city of Hubei province in central China, is spreading rapidly nationwide. A number of 
cases of neonates born to mothers with 2019-nCoV pneumonia have been recorded. However, the 
clinical features of these cases have not been reported, and there is no sufficient evidence for the 
proper prevention and control of 2019-nCoV infections in neonates.MethodsThe clinical features 
and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV 
infection in 5 hospitals from January 20 to February 5, 2020 were retrospectively 
analyzed.ResultsAmong these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of 
clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after 
delivery in 3 cases. In most cases, fever and a cough were the first symptoms experienced, and 1 
patient also had diarrhea. Of the newborns born to these mothers, 8 were male and 2 were female; 
4 were full-term infants and 6 were born premature; 2 were small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants 
and 1 was a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infant; there were 8 singletons and 2 twins. Of the 
neonates, 6 had a Pediatric Critical Illness Score (PCIS) score of less than 90. Clinically, the first 
symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever 
(n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), 
vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. Up to now, 5 neonates have been cured 
and discharged, 1 has died, and 4 neonates remain in hospital in a stable condition. Pharyngeal swab 
specimens were collected from 9 of the 10 neonates 1 to 9 days after birth for nucleic acid 
amplification tests for 2019-nCoV, all of which showed negative results.ConclusionsPerinatal 2019-
nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, 
premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, 
and even death. However, vertical transmission of 2019-nCoV is yet to be confirmed.

Abstract:IntroductionThe outbreak of the new Coronavirus in China in December 2019 and 
subsequently in various countries around the world has raised concerns about the possibility of 
vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus. The present study aimed to review published 
literature in this regard.MethodsIn this narrative review, were searched for all articles published in 
various databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science using 
MeSH-compliant keywords including COVID-19, Pregnancy, Vertical transmission, Coronavirus 2019, 
SARS-CoV-2 and 2019-nCoV from December 2019 to March 18, 2020 and reviewed them. All type of 
articles published about COVID-19 and vertical transmission in pregnancy were included.ResultsA 
review of 13 final articles published in this area revealed that COVID-19 can cause fetal distress, 
miscarriage, respiratory distress and preterm delivery in pregnant women but does not infect 
newborns. There has been no report of vertical transmission in pregnancy, and it has been found 
that clinical symptoms of COVID-19 in pregnant women are not different from those of non-
pregnant women.ConclusionOverall, due to lack of appropriate data about the effect of COVID-19 on 
pregnancy, it is necessary to monitor suspected pregnant women before and after delivery. For 
confirmed cases both the mother and the newborn child should be followed up comprehensively.

Abstract:Coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging disease with a rapid increase in cases and deaths 
since its first identification in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Limited data are available about 
coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy; however, information on illnesses associated with other 
highly pathogenic coronaviruses (ie, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East 
respiratory syndrome) might provide insights into coronavirus disease 2019's effects during 
pregnancy. Coronaviruses cause illness ranging in severity from the common cold to severe 
respiratory illness and death. Currently the primary epidemiologic risk factors for coronavirus 
disease 2019 include travel from mainland China (especially Hubei Province) or close contact with 
infected individuals within 14 days of symptom onset. Data suggest an incubation period of ∼5 days 
(range, 2-14 days). Average age of hospitalized patients has been 49-56 years, with a third to half 
with an underlying illness. Children have been rarely reported. Men were more frequent among 
hospitalized cases (54-73%). Frequent manifestations include fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32232217
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.017


diarrhea. Abnormal testing includes abnormalities on chest radiographic imaging, lymphopenia, 
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Initial reports suggest that acute respiratory distress syndrome 
develops in 17-29% of hospitalized patients. Overall case fatality rate appears to be ∼1%; however, 
early data may overestimate this rate. In 2 reports describing 18 pregnancies with coronavirus 
disease 2019, all were infected in the third trimester, and clinical findings were similar to those in 
nonpregnant adults. Fetal distress and preterm delivery were seen in some cases. All but 2 
pregnancies were cesarean deliveries and no evidence of in utero transmission was seen. Data on 
severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome in pregnancy are sparse. 
For severe acute respiratory syndrome, the largest series of 12 pregnancies had a case-fatality rate 
of 25%. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 4, disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy in 3, renal failure in 3, secondary bacterial pneumonia in 2, and sepsis in 2 patients. 
Mechanical ventilation was 3 times more likely among pregnant compared with nonpregnant 
women. Among 7 first-trimester infections, 4 ended in spontaneous abortion. Four of 5 women with 
severe acute respiratory syndrome after 24 weeks' gestation delivered preterm. For Middle East 
respiratory syndrome, there were 13 case reports in pregnant women, of which 2 were 
asymptomatic, identified as part of a contact investigation; 3 patients (23%) died. Two pregnancies 
ended in fetal demise and 2 were born preterm. No evidence of in utero transmission was seen in 
severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome. Currently no coronavirus-
specific treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Because 
coronavirus disease 2019 might increase the risk for pregnancy complications, management should 
optimally be in a health care facility with close maternal and fetal monitoring. Principles of 
management of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy include early isolation, aggressive infection 
control procedures, oxygen therapy, avoidance of fluid overload, consideration of empiric antibiotics 
(secondary to bacterial infection risk), laboratory testing for the virus and coinfection, fetal and 
uterine contraction monitoring, early mechanical ventilation for progressive respiratory failure, 
individualized delivery planning, and a team-based approach with multispecialty consultations. 
Information on coronavirus disease 2019 is increasing rapidly. Clinicians should continue to follow 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website to stay up to date with the latest 
information (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/index.html).

Abstract:OBJECTIVESThere are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by 
coronavirus during pregnancy. In women affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the case fatality rate appears higher in those affected in 
pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid review to guide health 
policy and management of women affected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, which was used to 
develop the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' (RCOG) guidelines on COVID-19 
infection in pregnancy.METHODSSearches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify 
primary case reports, case series, observational studies and randomized controlled trials describing 
women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy. Data were extracted from relevant papers. This review 
has been used to develop guidelines with representatives of the Royal College of Paediatrics and 
Child Health (RCPCH) and RCOG who provided expert consensus on areas in which data were 
lacking.RESULTSFrom 9965 search results in PubMed and 600 in MedRxiv, 21 relevant studies, all of 
which were case reports or case series, were identified. From reports of 32 women to date affected 
by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 30 babies (one set of twins, three ongoing pregnancies), seven 
(22%) were asymptomatic and two (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), one of whom 
remained on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. No maternal deaths have been reported to 
date. Delivery was by Cesarean section in 27 cases and by vaginal delivery in two, and 15 (47%) 
delivered preterm. There was one stillbirth and one neonatal death. In 25 babies, no cases of vertical 
transmission were reported; 15 were reported as being tested with reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction after delivery. Case fatality rates for SARS and MERS were 15% and 27%, respectively. 
SARS was associated with miscarriage or intrauterine death in five cases, and fetal growth restriction 
was noted in two ongoing pregnancies affected by SARS in the third trimester.CONCLUSIONSSerious 
morbidity occurred in 2/32 women with COVID-19, both of whom required ICU care. Compared with 
SARS and MERS, COVID-19 appears less lethal, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported 
to date and that one woman remains in a critical condition. Preterm delivery affected 47% of women 
hospitalized with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK's 
reasonable worst-case scenario of 80% of the population being affected is realized. Based on this 
review, RCOG, in consultation with RCPCH, developed guidance for delivery and neonatal care in 
pregnancies affected by COVID-19, which recommends that delivery mode be determined primarily 
by obstetric indication and recommends against routine separation of affected mothers and their 
babies. We hope that this review will be helpful for maternity and neonatal services planning their 
response to COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors. Ultrasound in Obstetrics & Gynecology published by

Abstract:Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurring during pregnancy is 
associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery. This case report describes successful 
treatment of preterm labor during acute COVID-19 infection. Standard treatment for preterm labor 
may allow patients with acute COVID-19 infection to recover without the need for preterm delivery. 
KEY POINTS: · Acute COVID-19 infection is associated with a high rate of preterm delivery.. · Standard 
treatment for preterm labor such as intravenous magnesium sulfate, antepartum steroid therapy 
and antibiotic prophylaxis for group B streptococcus infection were effective in this patient.. · In the 
absence of maternal or fetal compromise, acute COVID-19 infection is not an indication for early 
elective delivery..

Abstract:We read with great interest the study by Siyu Chen and colleagues. The authors evaluated 
the clinical features and outcomes of five pregnant patients with COVID-19 at term, whose delivery 
was uneventful and led to favorable perinatal outcomes for both mother and neonate. We would 
like to draw attention to a growing body of evidence that now points towards an under-addressed 
association between preterm maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection, preterm delivery and adverse neonatal 
outcomes, which is not reflected in Chen et al.'s small cohort. We also stress that vertical 
transmission, which was not tested for by Chen et al., should not be excluded as a potential 
mechanism for viral spread. Centers should therefore be meticulous in their approach to a SARS-
CoV-2+ pregnancy to optimize clinical outcomes for both mother and child. This article is protected

Abstract:OBJECTIVEto conduct a systematic review of the outcomes reported for pregnant patients 
with COVID 19.DATA SOURCESwe searched electronically Pubmed, Cinahl, Scopus using combination 
of keywords "Coronavirus and/ or pregnancy"; "COVID and/or pregnancy"; "COVID disease and/or 
pregnancy"; "COVID pneumonia and/or pregnancy. There were no restriction of languages in order 
to collect as much cases as possible.STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIAall pregnant women, with a COVID19 
diagnosed with acid nucleic test, with reported data about pregnancy and, in case of delivery, 
reported outcomes.STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODSall the studies included have been 
evaluated according the tool for evaluating the methodological quality of case reports and case 
series described by Murad et al. RESULTS: 6 studies including 51 women were eligible for the 
systematic review. Three pregnancies were ongoing at the time of the report; of the remaining 48, 
46 were delivered with a cesarean section and 2 vaginally; there was 1 stillbirth and 1 neonatal 
death.CONCLUSIONSalthough vertical transmission of SARS-Cov2 has been excluded thus far and the 
outcome for mothers and fetuses has been generally good, the high rate of preterm cesarean 
delivery is a reason for concern. These interventions were typically elective, and it is reasonable to 
question whether they were warranted or not. COVID-19 associated with respiratory insufficiency in 
late pregnancies certainly creates a complex clinical scenario.

Abstract:Objective: To summarize currently available evidence on maternal, fetal, and neonatal 
outcomes of pregnant women infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).Material and 
methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, and CBMdisc were searched for 
studies reporting maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of women infected with COVID-19 
published from 1 January 2020 to 26 March 2020. The protocol was registered with the Open 
Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/34ZAV).Results: In total, 18 studies comprising 114 
pregnant women were included in the review. Fever (87.5%) and cough (53.8%) were the most 
commonly reported symptoms, followed by fatigue (22.5%), diarrhea (8.8%), dyspnea (11.3%), sore 
throat (7.5%), and myalgia (16.3%). The majority of patients (91%) had cesarean delivery due to 
various indications. In terms of fetal and neonatal outcomes, stillbirth (1.2%), neonatal death (1.2%), 
preterm birth (21.3%), low birth weight (<2500 g, 5.3%), fetal distress (10.7%), and neonatal 
asphyxia (1.2%) were reported. There are reports of neonatal infection, but no direct evidence of 
intrauterine vertical transmission has been found.Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of

pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those of non-pregnant adults. Fetal and neonatal 
outcomes appear good in most cases, but available data only include pregnant women infected in 
their third trimesters. Further studies are needed to ascertain long-term outcomes and potential 
intrauterine vertical transmission.

Abstract:From February 24, 2020, a COVID-19 obstetric task force was structured to deliver 
management recommendations for obstetric care. From March 1, 2020, six COVID-19 hubs and their 
spokes were designated. An interim analysis of cases occurring in or transferred to these hubs was 
performed on March 20, 2020 and recommendations were released on March 24, 2020. The vision 
of this strict organization was to centralize patients in high-risk maternity centers in order to 
concentrate human resources and personal protective equipment (PPE), dedicate protected areas of 
these major hospitals, and centralize clinical multidisciplinary experience with this disease. All 
maternity hospitals were informed to provide a protected labor and delivery room for 
nontransferable patients in advanced labor. A pre-triage based on temperature and 14 other items 
was developed in order to screen suspected patients in all hospitals to be tested with 
nasopharyngeal swabs. Obstetric outpatient facilities were instructed to maintain scheduled 
pregnancy screening as per Italian guidelines, and to provide pre-triage screening and surgical masks 
for personnel and patients for pre-triage-negative patients. Forty-two cases were recorded in the 
first 20 days of hub and spoke organization. The clinical presentation was interstitial pneumonia in 
20 women. Of these, seven required respiratory support and eventually did well. Two premature 
labors occurred.Copyright This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Abstract:ObjectiveThe aim of this systematic review was to report pregnancy and perinatal 
outcomes of Coronavirus (CoV) spectrum infections, and particularly COVID-19 disease due to SARS-
COV-2 infection during pregnancy.Data sourcesMedline, Embase, Cinahl and Clinicaltrials.gov 
databases were searched electronically utilizing combinations of word variants for "coronavirus" or 
"severe acute respiratory syndrome" or "SARS" or "Middle East respiratory syndrome" or "MERS" or 
"COVID-19" and "pregnancy". The search and selection criteria were restricted to English 
language.Study eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria were pregnant women with a confirmed 
Coronavirus related illness, defined as either SARS, MERS or COVID-19.Study appraisal and synthesis 
methodsWe used meta-analyses of proportions to combine data and reported pooled proportions. 
The pregnancy outcomes observed included miscarriage, preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm 
prelabor rupture of membranes, fetal growth restriction, and mode of delivery. The perinatal 
outcomes observed were fetal distress, Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, neonatal asphyxia, 
admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal death, and evidence of vertical 
transmission.Results19 studies including 79 women were eligible for this systematic review: 41 
pregnancies (51.9%) affected by COVID-19, 12 (15.2%) by MERS, and 26 (32.9%) by SARS. An overt 
diagnosis of pneumonia was made in 91.8% and the most common symptoms were fever (82.6%), 
cough (57.1%) and dyspnea (27.0%). For all CoV infections, the rate of miscarriage was 39.1% (95% 
CI 20.2-59.8); the rate of preterm birth < 37 weeks was 24.3% (95% CI 12.5-38.6); premature 
prelabor rupture of membranes occurred in 20.7% (95% CI 9.5-34.9), preeclampsia in 16.2% (95% CI 
4.2-34.1), and fetal growth restriction in 11.7% (95% CI 3.2-24.4); 84% were delivered by cesarean; 
the rate of perinatal death was 11.1% (95% CI 84.8-19.6) and 57.2% (95% CI 3.6-99.8) of newborns 
were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. When focusing on COVID-19, the most common 
adverse pregnancy outcome was preterm birth 90% of whom also had pneumonia, PTB is the most 
common adverse pregnancy outcome. Miscarriage, preeclampsia, cesarean, and perinatal death (7-
11%) were also more common than in the general population. There have been no published cases 
of clinical evidence of vertical transmission. Evidence is accumulating rapidly, so these data may 
need to be updated soon. The findings from this study can guide and enhance prenatal counseling of 
women with COVID-19 infection occurring during pregnancy.

Abstract:BACKGROUNDThe ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused 
serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on 
maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia.METHODSWe 
conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes 
of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia.RESULTSDuring January 24 to February 
29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen 
suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the 
rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on 
admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, 
COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive 
protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, 
neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. 
There were three (18.8%) and three (16.7%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 
pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher 
than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 
infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal 
complications.CONCLUSIONSevere maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in 
pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild 
respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective 
screening on admission.
