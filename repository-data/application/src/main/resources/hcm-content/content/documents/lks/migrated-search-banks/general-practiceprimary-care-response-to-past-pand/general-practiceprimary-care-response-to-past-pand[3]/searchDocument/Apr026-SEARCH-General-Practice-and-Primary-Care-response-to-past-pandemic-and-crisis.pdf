Guidance for ethical collaboration 
 
The King’s Fund is an independent charitable foundation working for better health, especially in London. The 
King’s Fund seeks to work with a range of organisations to support all aspects of its work and, where appropriate, 
to generate income.  
 
We wish to develop and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with commercial and other health-related 
organisations without compromising the independence of the Fund. In this context we request that you review 
The King’s Fund’s ethical collaboration policy, attached here, which sets out our guiding principles for working 
with external clients. 
 
The following obligations have been developed to protect The King’s Fund’s missions and values. With particular 
reference to the literature searches and related services offered by the Information and Knowledge Services, 
please note the following: 

 
• You may share a copy of the final report with your client(s) in confidence, but it is essential that you do 

not present an edited version of any report as the work of The King’s Fund (i.e. a subset of data or 
selection of results must not be presented as the work of The King’s Fund); 

• Where evidence collated in response to a brief is cited by the client, appropriate reference should be 
made to the primary information source and not The King’s Fund (i.e. source material provided by the 
IKS must not be presented as that of The King’s Fund or work that is endorsed by The King’s Fund); 

• The King’s Fund gives no warranty that the deliverables of this agreement will not contain any material 
that may be disadvantageous to the clients’ business or area of work (for example, it will present 
research findings determined by objective analysis of available evidence regardless of whether they 
support a client’s work or position); 

• The King’s Fund should be consulted whenever and wherever its name is used by external organisations 
for external communications in relation to this literature search. Approval must be sought for any copy 
produced from The King’s Fund that is supported/sponsored by a client organisation; 

• At no time can The King’s Fund’s logo be used without express written permission for every occasion it 
is used.

An emergency can be described as “a type of event or imminent threat that produces or has the 
potential to produce a range of health consequences, and which requires coordinated action, usually 
urgent and often non-routine” (3). This includes epidemics, disasters (e.g. natural and technological), 
as well as those involving violence and conflict, which can often become protracted. Primary health 
care has an essential role to play in preventing, preparing for, responding to and recovering from any 
emergency situation.

patients fell on primary care physicians (PCP). This provided an excellent opportunity to investigate 
the implications of pandemic policies for the PCP role.AIMTo examine policies affecting the role of

Australia, Israel and England during the pandemic 2009/A/H1N1.RESULTSThe involvement of PCP in 
the pandemic response differed among the countries in timing and allocated responsibilities. The 
Israeli approach during the containment phase was to maximise the protection of PCP at the 
expense of putting pressure on hospitals where the suspected cases were tested and treated. In 
Australia and England, PCP managed the suspected patients from the beginning of the pandemic. 
The work of PCP in England was supported by the introduction of the National Pandemic Flu Service 
during the mitigation phase, whereas Australian PCP had no additional support structures and their 
role was constant and intensive throughout the pandemic period.CONCLUSIONHealth authorities 
need to engage with representatives of PCP to evaluate policies for pandemic planning and 
management. Adequate support and protection for PCP during different stages of pandemic 
management should be provided. What is known about the topic? During the influenza pandemic 
2009/A/H1N1, the main burden of diagnosing and managing the patients fell on PCP. The prominent 
role of PCP in the 2009/A/H1N1 pandemic presents an excellent opportunity to investigate 
implications of pandemic policies for primary care and to tackle the possible problems that these 
policies may impose on the ability of PCP to effectively participate in the public health response. 
What does this paper add? This paper examines policies that affected the roles of PCP in managing 
the influenza pandemic 2009/A/H1N1 in three countries: Australia, Israel and England. Although 
general evaluations of the pandemic response in different countries have previously been reported, 
this is the first study that focuses on policies for pandemic management at the primary care level. 
What are the implications for practitioners? Practitioners (PCP and primary care workers in general) 
would benefit if pandemic preparedness plans were constructed to provide an adequate system of 
support and protection to primary care workers during different stages of pandemic management. 
For policy makers, this analysis may help to overhaul the strategies for primary care engagement in 
the pandemic response.

infectious disease public health crises: an integrative systematic review of the literature. Disaster 
medicine and public health preparedness, 7(5), pp.522–533.   
OBJECTIVEPrevious research has identified gaps in pandemic response planning for primary care. 
Identifying the challenges that general practitioners (GPs) face during public health crises of 
infectious diseases will help to improve prepandemic planning. In this integrative systematic review, 
we identified research-based evidence to (1) challenges that GPs have when participating in 
pandemics or epidemics and (2) whether GPs from different countries encountered 
different challenges.METHODSA systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, 
EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases during 
October to November 2012 to identify studies relevant to experience by GPs during epidemics 
or pandemics.RESULTSSix quantitative, 2 mixed method, and 2 qualitative studies met the 
inclusion criteria. The challenges identified were not exclusive to specific countries and 
encompassed different responses to outbreaks. These challenges included difficulties with 
information access; supply and use of personal protective equipment; performing public health 
responsibilities; obtaining support from the authorities; appropriate training; and the emotional 
effects of participating in the response to an infectious disease with unknown characteristics 
and lethality.CONCLUSIONGPs’ response to public health crises in different countries presents 
potential for improving pandemic preparedness.

Background  Although primary health care, and in particular, general practice will be at the frontline 
in the response to pandemic influenza, there are no frameworks to guide systematic planning for 
this task or to appraise available plans for their relevance to general practice. We aimed to develop a 
framework that will facilitate planning for general practice, and used it to appraise pandemic plans 
from Australia, England, USA, New Zealand and Canada. Methodology/Principal Findings We 
adapted the Haddon matrix to develop the framework, populating its cells through a multi-method 
study that incorporated the peer-reviewed and grey literature, interviews with general practitioners, 
practice nurses and senior decision-makers, and desktop simulation exercises. We used the 
framework to analyse 89 publicly-available jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five 
countries. The framework identifies four functional domains: clinical care for influenza and other 
needs, public health responsibilities, the internal environment and the macro-environment of 
general practice. No plan addressed all four domains. Most plans either ignored or were sketchy 
about non-influenza clinical needs, and about the contribution of general practice to public health 
beyond surveillance. Collaborations between general practices were addressed in few plans, and 
inter-relationships with the broader health system, even less frequently. Conclusions This is the first 
study to provide a framework to guide general practice planning for pandemic influenza. The 
framework helped identify critical shortcomings in available plans. Engaging general practice 
effectively in planning is challenging, particularly where governance structures for primary health 
care are weak. We identify implications for practice and for research.

The 2009 pandemic of H1N1 influenza, compounded with seasonal influenza, posed a global 
challenge. Despite the announcement of post-pandemic period on 10 August 2010 by the WHO, 
H1N1 (2009) virus would continue to circulate as a seasonal virus for some years and national health 
authorities should remain vigilant due to unpredictable behaviour of the virus. Majority of the world 
population is living in countries with inadequate resources to purchase vaccines and stockpile 
antiviral drugs. Basic hygienic measures such as wearing face masks and the hygienic practice of 
hand washing could reduce the spread of the respiratory viruses. However, the imminent issue is 
translating these measures into day-to-day practice. The experience from Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong has shown that general practitioners (GPs) were willing to discharge 
their duties despite risks of getting infected themselves. SARS event has highlighted the inadequate 
interface between primary and secondary care and valuable health care resources were thus 
inappropriately matched to community needs.There are various ways for GPs to contribute in 
combating the influenza pandemic. They are prompt in detecting and monitoring epidemics and 
mini-epidemics of viral illnesses in the community. They can empower and raise the health literacy 
of the community such as advocating personal hygiene and other precautious measures. GPs could 
also assist in the development of protocols for primary care management of patients with flu-like 
illnesses and conduct clinical audits on the standards of preventive and treatment measures. GPs 
with adequate liaison with public health agencies would facilitate early diagnosis of patients 
with influenza.In this article, we summarise the primary care actions for phases 4-6 of the pandemic. 
We shall discuss the novel roles of GPs as alternative source of health care for patients who would 
otherwise be cared for in the secondary care level. The health care system would thus remain 
sustainable during the public health crisis.

INTRODUCTIONThe 2009 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction/Emergency Preparedness 
(DRR/EP) and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 demonstrate increased international

commitment to DRR/EP in addition to response and recovery. In addition, the World Health Report 
2008 has re-focused the world’s attention on the renewal of Primary Health Care (PHC) as a set of 
values/principles for all sectors. Evidence suggests that access to comprehensive PHC improves 
health outcomes and an integrated PHC approach may improve health in low income countries 
(LICs). Strong PHC health systems can provide stronger health emergency management, which 
reinforce each other for healthier communities.PROBLEMThe global re-emphasis of PHC recently 
necessitates the health sector and the broader disaster community to consider health emergency 
management from the perspective of PHC. How PHC is being described in the literature related to 
disasters and the quality of this literature is reviewed. Identifying which topics/lessons learned are 
being published helps to identify key lessons learned, gaps and 
future directions.METHODSFourteen major scientific and grey literature databases searched. 
Primary Health Care or Primary Care coupled with the term disaster was searched (title or abstract). 
The 2009 ISDR definition of disaster and the 1978 World Health Organization definition of Primary 
Health Care were used. 119 articles resulted.RESULTSLiterature characteristics; 16% research 
papers, only 29% target LICs, 8% of authors were from LICs, 7% clearly defined PHC, 50% used PHC 
to denote care provided by clinicians and 4% cited PHC values and principles. Most topics related to 
disaster response. Key topics; true need for PHC, mental health, chronic disease, models of PHC, 
importance of PHC soon after a natural disaster relative to acute care, methods of surge capacity, 
utilization patterns in recovery, access to vulnerable populations, rebuilding with the PHC approach 
and using current PHC infrastructure to build capacity for disasters.CONCLUSIONSPrimary Health 
Care is very important for effective health emergency management during response and recovery, 
but also for risk reduction, including preparedness. There is need to; increase the quality of this 
research, clarify terminology, encourage paper authorship from LICs, develop and validate PHC- 
specific disaster indicators and to encourage organizations involved in PHC disaster activities to 
publish data. Lessons learned from high-income countries need contextual analysis about 
applicability in low-income countries.

disease surveillance, diagnosis and treatment, prevention, and patient education. This commentary 
describes the contextual factors that may influence primary care providers’ perspectives on their 
pandemic roles and responsibilities. These factors include the natural evolution of the pandemic 
situation, with early uncertainty affecting decision-making and communication; the variation in 
typical practice patterns and clinical expertise across and within primary care providers; and the lack 
of representation of practicing primary care providers in pandemic planning and decision-making 
bodies.

for Disaster Response and Recovery. Prehospital & Disaster Medicine, 31(4), pp.454–456.   
Telehealth has great promise to improve and even revolutionize emergency response and recovery. 
Yet telehealth in general, and direct-to-consumer (DTC) telehealth in particular, are underutilized in 
disasters. Direct-to-consumer telehealth services allow patients to request virtual visits with health 
care providers, in real-time, via phone or video conferencing (online video or mobile phone 
applications). Although DTC services for routine primary care are growing rapidly, there is no 
published literature on the potential application of DTC telehealth to disaster response and recovery 
because these services are so new. This report presents several potential uses of DTC telehealth 
across multiple disaster phases (acute response, subacute response, and recovery) while noting the 
logistical, legal, and policy challenges that must be addressed to allow for expanded use. Uscher-

the Purpose Review: This paper will review the literature on global disasters and the mental health 
impact of disasters, and discuss the use of digital health/telemental health in providing care in post-
disaster settings.Recent Findings: Global disasters, natural and manmade, are on the rise. As a 
consequence, there are increases in the health and mental health impact in the affected 
populations. We examine the literature on the health and mental health impact of disasters and the 
role of digital health/telemental health in response to meeting those needs. We examine the use of 
digital health/telemental health in two case examples, one of a natural disaster and one of a man-
made disaster. Finally, we examine a blended telemental health model for collaboration between 
mental health and primary care providers in post-disaster settings. Digital health/telemental health is 
positioned on the cusp of the technology explosion, thus bringing much needed medical and mental 
health care to previously under-served populations.

Infectious Diseases, 70(5), pp.976–986.   
The 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa provided an opportunity to improve our response to 
highly infectious diseases. We performed a systematic literature review in PubMed, Cochrane 
Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science of research articles that evaluated benefits and 
challenges of hospital Ebola preparation in developed countries. We excluded studies performed in 
non-developed countries, and those limited to primary care settings, the public health sector, and 
pediatric populations. Thirty-five articles were included. Preparedness activities were beneficial for 
identifying gaps in hospital readiness. Training improved health-care workers’ (HCW) infection 
control practices and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. The biggest challenge was related to 
PPE, followed by problems with hospital infrastructure and resources. HCWs feared managing Ebola 
patients, affecting their willingness to care for them. Standardizing protocols, PPE types, and 
frequency of training and providing financial support will improve future preparedness. It is unclear 
whether preparations resulted in sustained improvements. Prospero Registration.

BACKGROUNDKnowledge transfer of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 
involves the dissemination of created/acquired information on MERS-CoV in hospitals, making this

information accessible to all healthcare workers (HCWs). This study evaluated the perceived 
effectiveness of MERS-CoV educational programs and knowledge transfer among primary care HCWs 
at a hospital in Saudi Arabia that witnessed the largest outbreak of confirmed MERS-CoV cases in 
this country.METHODSA survey was distributed among primary care HCWs at five clinics in Saudi 
Arabia in 2016. Those with non-direct patient care responsibilities were excluded. Their knowledge 
was evaluated against facts published by Mayo Clinic Foundation, and its percentage mean score 
(PMS) ± standard deviation was calculated. HCWs’ perceived effectiveness of educational programs 
and knowledge transfer was classified as negative or positive.RESULTSSample comprised of 404 
HCWs, of which 64% were females and 36% were males. Almost 26% were ≤ 30 years old, and 42% 
had > 10 years of work experience. Almost 46.5% were nurses, 23.0% physicians, 18.1% were 
pharmacists, and 12.4% were technical staff. PMS for knowledge was 71.1 ± 19.4. The prevalence of 
negative perceptions towards educational programs was 22.5% and of knowledge transfer was 
20.8%. Older(> 40 years of age) and more experienced(> 10 years) HCWs had the highest PMS for 
knowledge(73.4 ± 18.9,P = 0.005 and 76.9 ± 15.7,P < 0.001 respectively). Negative perceptions of 
educational programs (49.4 ± 20.7; P < 0.001) and knowledge transfer (46.0 ± 19.7; P = 0.001) were 
associated with a lower knowledge PMS. Males were 2.4[95% confidence interval 1.4-4.2] times and 
2.0[1.1-3.5] times more likely to have negative perceptions of educational programs and knowledge 
transfer (adjusted (adj.)P = 0.001 and adj. P = 0.023, respectively). Physicians/pharmacists were 
1.8[1.03-3.11] and 2.8[1.6-5.0] times more likely to have negative perceptions of both outcomes 
(adj. P = 0.038 and adj. P = 0.001, respectively). Less experienced HCWs were 2.1[1.3-3.5] times and 
4.9[2.6-9.2] times more likely to exhibit negative perceptions of the two outcomes (adj. P < 0.001 
each).CONCLUSIONSA negative perception of the effectiveness of MERS-CoV knowledge transfer 
was associated with poorer knowledge and was more prevalent among male HCWs, 
physicians/pharmacists and less experienced HCWs. Hospitals should always refer to efficient 
knowledge sharing and educational strategies that render beneficial outcomes to patients, HCWs, 
and the public community.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23690388/  
PURPOSEWe sought to compare and contrast patterns of change toward patient-centered medical 
homes (PCMHs) in 5 New Orleans primary care safety net clinics in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Katrina. We assessed the general direction of change in practice to discover possible reasons for 
differences in patterns of change, and to identify impediments to change.METHODSData collection 
consisted of 5 semiannual telephone interviews with clinic leadership over 2.5 years supplemented 
by administrative audits. We used standard survey indexes of PCMH to monitor practice change. We 
conducted site visits and unstructured in-person interviews with clinicians and staff of the 
5 clinics.RESULTSPCMH index scores improved during the observation period with variations in rates 
of change and initial levels of PCMH. Qualitative analysis suggested possible explanations for this 
differential success: (1) early vs later starts in practice change, (2) funding based on patient 
outcomes, (3) demands that compete with practice change, (4) qualities of clinic leadership, and (5) 
relations with the communities where patients live. Barriers to practice change included high 
demand for services, deficient linkages between hospital and specialty care, lack of staff resources, 
and a need to focus on clinic finances.CONCLUSIONSThe PCMH model can successfully address the 
needs of safety net populations. Stable leadership committed to serving safety net patients via the 
PCMH model is important for successful practice transformation. Beyond clinic walls, cultivating 
deep ties to the communities that clinics serve also supports the PCMH model.

primary care clinics in New Orleans receiving federal funds to expand services and improve 
care delivery.STUDY DESIGNMultiwave, longitudinal, observational study of a local safety-net 
primary care system.DATA COLLECTIONClinic-level data from a semiannual survey of clinic leaders 
(89.3 percent response rate), augmented by administrative records.PRINCIPAL FINDINGSOverall, 62 
percent of the clinics responded to financial incentives by achieving PCMH recognition from the 
National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA). Higher patient volume, higher baseline PCMH 
scores, and type of ownership were significant predictors of achieving NCQA recognition. The 
steepest increase in adoption of PCMH processes occurred among clinics achieving the highest, Level 
3, NCQA recognition. Following NCQA recognition, 88.9 percent stabilized or increased their use of 
PCMH processes, although several specific PCMH processes had very low rates of 
adoption overall.CONCLUSIONSFindings demonstrate that widespread PCMH implementation is 
possible in a safety-net environment when external financial incentives are aligned with the goal of 
practice innovation.

The closure of the Manawatu Gorge in New Zealand in August 2011 caused a change in the travel 
time for patients living in the east of the MidCentral Health District to their health services located in 
Palmerston North. This presented an opportunity to study the effect a change in spatial access had 
on a population before and after such an event. We used a retrospective cohort design with

Literature Search: [TITLE OF SEARCH HERE] 
 

routinely collected data from general practice and hospital services. Realised accessibility was 
calculated for 101,456 patients over 3.5 years. General practice utilization appeared to be the only 
service affected negatively during the gorge closure (rate ratio 1.106). Outpatient attendances had 
an increase in use by those with increased travel time (rate ratio 0.922). There was evidence of other 
unidentified factors that impacted the use of services across both intervention and control groups 
between the gorge open and closed periods. These results were more conservative than those 
produced by a traditional uncontrolled travel time category analysis which suggested a correlation in 
non-urgent ED attendance and general practice and boundary effects in all ED attendances and 
hospital admissions.

Primary Care Services. Disaster medicine and public health preparedness, 10(3), pp.386–393.   
OBJECTIVEHurricane Sandy in the Rockaways, Queens, forced residents to evacuate and primary 
care providers to close or curtail operations. A large deficit in primary care access was apparent in 
the immediate aftermath of the storm. Our objective was to build a computational model to aid 
responders in planning to situate primary care services in a disaster-affected area.METHODSUsing an 
agent-based modeling platform, HAZEL, we simulated the Rockaways population, its evacuation 
behavior, and primary care providers’ availability in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Data sources 
for this model included post-storm and community health surveys from New York City, a survey of 
the Rockaways primary care providers, and research literature. The model then tested geospatially 
specific interventions to address storm-related access deficits.RESULTSThe model revealed that 
areas of high primary care access deficit were concentrated in the eastern part of the Rockaways. 
Placing mobile health clinics in the most populous census tracts reduced the access deficit 
significantly, whereas increasing providers’ capacity by 50% reduced the deficit to a 
lesser degree.CONCLUSIONSAn agent-based model may be a useful tool to have in place so that 
policy makers can conduct scenario-based analyses to plan interventions optimally in the event of a 
disaster. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2016;10:386-393).

react? Assessing the functional capacity of the primary health care system in rural Orissa, India to 
respond to the devastating flood of September 2008. Global health action, 5.   
BACKGROUNDEarly detection of an impending flood and the availability of countermeasures to deal 
with it can significantly reduce its health impacts. In developing countries like India, public primary 
health care facilities are frontline organizations that deal with disasters particularly in rural settings. 
For developing robust counter reacting systems evaluating preparedness capacities within existing 
systems becomes necessary.OBJECTIVEThe objective of the study is to assess the functional capacity 
of the primary health care system in Jagatsinghpur district of rural Orissa in India to respond to the 
devastating flood of September 2008.METHODSAn onsite survey was conducted in all 29 primary 
and secondary facilities in five rural blocks (administrative units) of Jagatsinghpur district in Orissa 
state. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was administered face to face in the facilities. The data 
was entered, processed and analyzed using STATA(®) 10.RESULTSData from our primary survey

clearly shows that the healthcare facilities are ill prepared to handle the flood despite being faced by 
them annually. Basic utilities like electricity backup and essential medical supplies are lacking during 
floods. Lack of human resources along with missing standard operating procedures; pre-identified 
communication and incident command systems; effective leadership; and weak financial structures 
are the main hindering factors in mounting an adequate response to 
the floods.CONCLUSIONThe 2008 flood challenged the primary curative and preventive health care 
services in Jagatsinghpur. Simple steps like developing facility specific preparedness plans which 
detail out standard operating procedures during floods and identify clear lines of command will go a 
long way in strengthening the response to future floods. Performance critiques provided by the 
grass roots workers, like this one, should be used for institutional learning and effective 
preparedness planning. Additionally each facility should maintain contingency funds for emergency 
response along with local vendor agreements to ensure stock supplies during floods. The facilities 
should ensure that baseline public health standards for health care delivery identified by the 
Government are met in non-flood periods in order to improve the response during floods. Building 
strong public primary health care systems is a development challenge. The recovery phases of 
disasters should be seen as an opportunity to expand and improve services and facilities.

One aspect of the structure of Japan’s health-care system that bears on the recent earthquake is the 
weakness of the primary-care system.1 In Japan, most patients get their care through hospitals and 
subspecialists. The weak primary-care system has left hospitals overwhelmed with patients seeking 
attention for non-urgent needs, and health-care workers in the hardest-hit areas are lamenting the 
influx of primary-care-type patients.

<h2>Summary</h2><p>At 1251 h on Feb 22, 2011, an earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand, 
causing widespread destruction. The only regional acute hospital was compromised but was able to 
continue to provide care, supported by other hospitals and primary care facilities in the city. 6659 
people were injured and 182 died in the initial 24 h. The massive peak ground accelerations, the 
time of the day, and the collapse of major buildings contributed to injuries, but the proximity of the 
hospital to the central business district, which was the most affected, and the provision of good 
medical care based on careful preparation helped reduce mortality and the burden of injury. Lessons 
learned from the health response to this earthquake include the need for emergency departments 
to prepare for: patients arriving by unusual means without prehospital care, manual registration and 
tracking of patients, patient reluctance to come into hospital buildings, complete loss of electrical 
power, management of the many willing helpers, alternative communication methods, control of 
the media, and teamwork with clear leadership. Additionally, atypical providers of acute injury care 
need to be integrated into response plans.</p>

2011. Nursing & Health Sciences, 19(1), pp.29–34.   
This paper summarizes, elaborates upon, and contrasts the findings of two research projects that 
explored how general practitioners and nurses coped with the dual challenge of personal and work 
demands following the earthquakes in Canterbury, New Zealand, in 2010 and 2011. Qualitative data 
from two separate studies - the first with general practitioners and the second with nurses - are 
compared to identify the challenges faced during and following the earthquakes. Semi-structured 
interviews took place with eight general practitioners two years after the start of the earthquake 
sequence and 11 nurses a year later to enable exploration of the longer-term aspects of the recovery 
process. The interview transcripts were analyzed and coded using a constructivist grounded theory 
approach. The analysis identified that the earthquakes had a significant impact on nurses and 
general practitioners both in terms of their professional and personal lives. The nurses and general 
practitioners commented on the emotional impact and their support needs, as well as some of the 
longer-term recovery issues.

survivors of the 2011 Utøya attack in Norway. BMC health services research, 15, p.158.   
BACKGROUNDFor effective organization of health services after terror attacks, it is vital to gain 
insight into survivors’ health service utilization. Following the 2011 Utøya mass shooting in Norway, 
a proactive outreach programme was launched to prevent unmet help needs. All survivors received 
health services during the first five months, yet an important minority were not proactively 
followed-up. This study assessed the prevalence of health service utilization and factors associated 
with mental health service utilization among the survivors 5-15 months after 
the attack.METHODSThe study comprised data from interviews using standardised questionnaires 
performed 4-5 (T1) and 14-15 (T2) months after the attack. Altogether 281 of 490 (57.3%) survivors 
answered questions on health service utilization at T2 and were included in this study. Users and 
non-users of mental health services were compared using Pearson Chi Square tests (categorical 
variables) and independent t-tests (continuous variables). Multivariate logistic regression analyses 
were conducted to examine the relationship between mental health service utilization at T2 and 
early (model 1) and concurrent (model 2) posttraumatic stress reactions, mental distress and 
somatic symptoms. Both models were adjusted for age, gender and predisaster utilization of mental 
health services.RESULTSAltogether 267 (95.0%) of 281 survivors reported contact with health 
services at T2, including 254 (90.4%) with ≥1 types of primary care services; and 192 (68.3%) with 
mental health services. In bivariate analyses, mental health service utilization was associated with 
female gender, injuries, PTSD, mental distress, somatic symptoms, and sleep problems. After 
multivariate adjustments for early symptom levels (model 1), only mental distress remained 
significantly associated with mental health service utilization at T2 (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.8). In the 
analysis adjusting for concurrent symptom levels (model 2), only somatic symptoms were associated 
with mental health service utilization (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.8-10.8).CONCLUSIONSThe high utilization of 
both primary and secondary health services among young survivors 5-15 months after the attack 
underscores the importance of allocating resources to meet the increased demand for services over 
a longer time period. The results further highlight the need to address somatic symptoms in disaster 
survivors who receive mental health services.

for GPs. Australian Family Physician, 37(10), pp.794–799, 802–804.   
BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus has a range of subtypes characterised by the display of particular 
surface structures and is associated with significant symptoms and a tendency to cause epidemics 
and pandemics. OBJECTIVE: This article presents a checklist to assist general practitioners in 
preparing for an influenza pandemic. DISCUSSION: The Australian Federal Government launched 
‘Exercise Cumpston’ in October 2006 to assess Australian pandemic preparedness. The report of the 
outcomes recommends the integration of general practice into the planning process at a national 
and jurisdictional level. General practitioners are enthusiastic about receiving further information 
and training in pandemic preparedness but preparing a general practice to deal with an influenza 
pandemic is a complex task.

journal of Australia, 192(7), pp.378–380.   
OBJECTIVETo assess the views, needs and intended behaviour of general practitioners and practice 
nurses (PNs) regarding pandemic influenza.DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTSA postal survey of 
GPs and PNs in four Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, selected to represent a 
diverse sample of practices from inner-city, semi-urban and rural areas. The study was undertaken 
from 1 February to 1 April 2009.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESGPs’ and PNs’ responses to survey 
statements assessing their awareness and perceived personal risk, intended behaviour in the event 
of a pandemic, and expectations surrounding antivirals, vaccine and personal and 
family protection.RESULTSOf 390 general practice staff who were sent the survey, 139 (36%) 
completed it. Most respondents felt confident that they possessed the necessary knowledge (71.5%, 
98/137) and skills (73.7%, 101/137) to provide patient care during an influenza pandemic. Although 
38.7% (53/137) stated that they would visit quarantined symptomatic patients, 41.6% (57/137) were 
unsure. More than half the respondents (53.2%, 74/139) stated that they would require access to 
vaccination and antivirals for their family as well as themselves before they would attend 
symptomatic patients at the general practice.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide evidence of the 
need to ensure that general practice staff have access to personal and family protection to 
encourage an adequate response to a pandemic situation.

experience in Melbourne, Victoria. Australian family physician, 39(5), pp.313–316.   
BACKGROUNDGeneral practice in Australia is expected to play a major role in responding to an 
influenza pandemic. This study investigated the experience of frontline general practice during the 
H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009.METHODSSemi-structured interviews were conducted with 
general practices in the northern suburbs of Melbourne (Victoria) in August and September 2009. 
Purposive sampling chose practices with high volumes of patient presentations early in the 
pandemic. Interviews were content transcribed at the time of interview. Major themes were 
identified through discussion with general practice division personnel and academic general 
practitioners in the field.RESULTSThere was significant variability in the pandemic experiences of the 
10 participating practices.DISCUSSIONAddressing issues identified in this study could increase the 
capacity of general practice to support the community and public health measures during a 
pandemic. Future planning for the role of general practice in pandemics should include pre-
pandemic assessment of practice capacity, review of public health communication strategies and 
workforce protection, and improved integration of general practice and public health responses.

OBJECTIVETo compare how the infectious disease outbreaks H1N1 and severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) affected community-based GPs and FPs.DESIGNA mailed survey sent after the 
H1N1 outbreak compared with the results of similar survey completed after the 
SARS outbreak.SETTINGGreater Toronto area in Ontario.PARTICIPANTSA total of 183 randomly 
selected GPs and FPs who provided office-based care.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESThe perceptions 
of GPs and FPs on how serious infectious disease outbreaks affected their clinical work and personal 
lives; their preparedness for a serious infectious disease outbreak; and the types of information they 
want to receive and the sources they wanted to receive information from during a serious infectious 
disease outbreak. The responses from this survey were compared with the responses of GPs and FPs 
in the greater Toronto area who completed a similar survey in 2003 after the 
SARS outbreak.RESULTSAfter the H1N1 outbreak, GPs and FPs still had substantial concerns about 
the effects of serious infectious disease outbreaks on the health of their family members. Physicians 
made changes to various office practices in order to manage and deal with patients with serious 
infectious diseases. They expressed concerns about the effects of an infectious disease on the 
provision of health care services. Also, physicians wanted to quickly receive accurate information 
from the provincial government and their medical associations.CONCLUSIONSerious community-
based infectious diseases are a personal concern for GPs and FPs, and have considerable effects on 
their clinical practice. Further work examining the timely flow of relevant information through

attitude and behavior about public health emergencies and the response capacity of primary care 
medical staffs of Guangdong Province, China. BMC Health Services Research, 12, p.338.   

Doc number: 338  Abstract  Background: Primary care medical staffs’ knowledge, attitude and 
behavior about health emergency and the response capacity are directly related to the control and 
prevention of public health emergencies. Therefore, it is of great significance for improving primary 
care to gain in-depth knowledge about knowledge, attitude and behavior and the response capacity 
of primary care medical staffs. The main objective of this study is to explore knowledge, attitude and 
behavior, and the response capacity of primary care medical staffs of Guangdong Province, 
China.  Methods: Stratified clustered sample method was used in the anonymous questionnaire 
investigation about knowledge, attitude and behavior, and the response capacity of 3410 primary 
care medical staffs in 15 cities of Guangdong Province, China from July, 2010 to October 2010. The 
emergency response capacity was evaluated by 33 questions. The highest score of the response 
capacity was 100 points (full score), score of 70 was a standard.  Results: 62.4% primary care medical 
staffs believed that public health emergencies would happen. Influenza (3.86 ± 0.88), food poisoning 
(3.35 ± 0.75), and environmental pollution events (3.23 ± 0.80) (the total score was 5) were 
considered most likely to occur. Among the 7 public health emergency skills, the highest self-
assessment score is ‘public health emergency prevention skills’ (2.90 ± 0.68), the lowest is ‘public 
health emergency risk management (the total score was 5)’ (1.81 ± 0.40). Attitude evaluation 
showed 66.1% of the medical staffs believed that the community awareness of risk management 
were ordinary. Evaluation of response capacity of health emergency showed that the score of 
primary care medical staffs was 67.23 ± 10.61, and the response capacity of senior physicians, public

health physicians and physicians with relatively long-term practice were significantly better (P 
<0.05). Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed gender, title, position, type of work, 
work experience and whether to participate relative training were the main factors affecting the 
health emergency response capacity.  Conclusions: The knowledge, attitude and behavior about 
public health emergencies and the response capacity of primary care medical staffs of Guangdong 
Province (China) were poor. Health administrative departments should strengthen the training of 
health emergency knowledge and skills of the primary care medical staffs to enhance their health 
emergency response capabilities.

Kong: a mixed quantitative and qualitative study. International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : 
official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases, 16(9), p.e687.   

OBJECTIVESThe current study was conducted to use a developed framework to appraise the public 
primary care response to pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus in Hong Kong in 2009.METHODSA 
cross-sectional survey was conducted of 300 doctors working in public primary care clinics. In 
addition, a qualitative study was conducted in two selected general outpatient clinics (GOPCs) with 
10 doctors between September and December 2009.RESULTSWe found that there was an increase 
in clinical service demand for public primary care doctors and that there was lower compliance with 
hand washing as compared to the wearing of masks among GOPC doctors during the 
study period.CONCLUSIONSSince hand hygiene and influenza vaccination are effective methods to 
prevent the spread of influenza infection, future studies should explore the reasons for non-
compliance with these preventive behaviors among doctors. More education and training in dealing 
with influenza A H1N1 infection may be needed.

(H1N1) and EHEC 
outbreak?]. Bundesgesundheitsblatt, Gesundheitsforschung, Gesundheitsschutz, 57(6), pp.687–
693.   
BACKGROUNDAs primary care givers with a coordinating function, general practitioners (GP) play a 
key role in dealing with epidemics and pandemics. As of yet, there are no studies in Germany 
describing the difficulties experienced by GPs in patient care during 
epidemics/pandemics.OBJECTIVESThis study aimed at identifying the problem areas in GPs’ patient 
care during the H1N1 and EHEC (enterohemorrhagic strain of Escherichia coli) outbreaks. With this 
information, recommendations for guaranteeing proper patient care during future 
epidemics/pandemics can be derived.MATERIALS AND METHODSIn all, 12 qualitative, semi-
structured, open guideline interviews with GPs in Hamburg and Lübeck were conducted, transcribed, 
and evaluated with qualitative content analysis.RESULTSFive areas in ambulatory patient care were 
identified in which changes are needed from the primary care perspective: provision of information 
for GPs, workload, financing of epidemic-related measures, organization of the practices, care of 
those taken ill.CONCLUSIONSThe workload of GPs in particular can and should be reduced through 
successful, centralized information distribution during epidemics/pandemics. The GP’s function as a 
coordinator should be supported and consolidated, in order to relieve the in-patient sector in cases 
of an epidemic/pandemic. Secured financing of epidemic-associated measures can help ensure 
patient care.

practices for pandemic influenza and the effect of a preparedness plan in Japan: a prefecture-wide 
cross-sectional study. BMC family practice, 14, p.174.   
BACKGROUNDCases of emerging infectious diseases, including H5N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, and 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, have been reported in recent years, and the threat of pandemic 
outbreaks persists. In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in 
communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been 
highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care 
practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined 
PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a 
pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic.METHODSWe used a survey questionnaire to 
assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. 
The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their 
institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and 
hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness 
and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses.RESULTSA total 
of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment 
(PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low 
rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 
masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs 
adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, 
reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 
5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 
5.60).CONCLUSIONSWith regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not 
adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic. Awareness of the national pandemic preparedness 
plan is likely to promote prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs and surveillance activity.

case study in pandemic response co-ordination. Journal of primary health care, 2(4), pp.323–329.   
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXTReviews of overseas pandemic responses have suggested that stronger 
links between primary care and other parts of the health sector are required. The influenza A (H1N1) 
2009 ('H1N1 09’) pandemic was the first real test of New Zealand’s 
pandemic preparedness.ASSESSMENT OF PROBLEMIn the six months from May to October 2009, 
there were 595 confirmed cases of H1N1 09 in Canterbury, with 187 hospitalisations and three 
deaths. This paper describes the way a range of Canterbury agencies worked together in a co-
ordinated health-led response aimed at minimising the impact of H1N1 09 in the community and 
maintaining effective health care services for both influenza and non-
influenza patients.STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENTKey strategies included sector-wide response co-
ordination, intelligence and communications, a combined public health/primary care response 
during the ‘containment’ phase, and universal red/green streaming supported by dedicated 
’flu centres and an 0800 call centre during the ‘manage it’ phase.LESSONSDespite the considerable 
impact of the H1N1 09 virus in Canterbury, health care services were not overwhelmed. The key 
lesson learned from the Canterbury H1N1 09 response has been the importance of preparing and 
working together across the sector.

INTRODUCTIONTo inform future pandemic planning and disaster response, we aimed to review the 
literature on the health sector response to the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic in New Zealand in 
2009.METHODSWe searched PubMed and Google Scholar along with the websites of government 
agencies for the period 1 April 2009 to 20 May 2012.RESULTSIn 2009, 18% of the New Zealand 
population had evidence of infection from the pandemic strain, 1122 people were hospitalised (with 
pandemic influenza as the primary diagnosis), 102 of those hospitalised were treated in intensive 
care units (ICU), and there were an estimated 49 pandemic-attributed deaths. At the severe end of 
the disease spectrum (ICU admissions and mortality), the health burden was significantly worse for 
Maori and Pacific peoples. The available evidence (including various estimates of low case-fatality 
risk relative to other high income countries), is consistent with the overall response in the public 
health, primary care and hospital sectors being fairly successful. Nevertheless, a number of likely 
weaknesses were identified, including a relative lack of: (i) a detailed review of the epidemiology and 
health sector response; (ii) sophisticated analytic studies to identify risk factors (e.g., using case-
control studies); (iii) studies on pandemic vaccine uptake and public acceptability; and (iv) evaluation 
of the health protection messages that were used in campaigns and in media releases from 
health authorities.CONCLUSIONSThere appear to have been both strengths and weakness in the 
New Zealand health sector’s response to the 2009 influenza pandemic. Nevertheless, it is probably 
still worthwhile to address some of the omissions to inform future pandemic and natural disaster 
planning and preparations.

general practice during an influenza pandemic. PloS one, 8(7), p.e69408.   
BACKGROUNDGPs play a major role in influenza epidemics, and most patients with influenza-like-
illness (ILI) are treated in general practice or by primary care doctors on duty in out-of-hours services 
(OOH). Little is known about the surge capacity in primary care services during an influenza 
pandemic, and how the relationship between them changes.AIMTo investigate how general practice 
and OOH services were used by patients during the 2009 pandemic in Norway and the impact of the 
pandemic on primary care services in comparison to a normal 
influenza season.MATERIALSData from electronic remuneration claims from all OOH doctors and 
regular GPs for 2009.METHODSWe conducted a registry-based study of all ILI consultations in the 
2009 pandemic with the 2008/09 influenza season (normal season) as baseline 
for comparison.RESULTSThe majority (82.2%) of ILI consultations during the 2009 pandemic took 
place in general practice. The corresponding number in the 2008/09 season was 89.3%. Compared 
with general practice, the adjusted odds ratio for ILI with all other diagnoses as reference in OOH 
services was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.18, 1.27) for the 2008/2009 season and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.84, 1.91) for the 
pandemic influenza season. In total there was a 3.3-fold increase in ILI consultations during the 
pandemic compared to the 2008/09 season. A 5.5-fold increase of ILI consultations were observed in 
OOH services in comparison to the 2008/09 season. Children and young adults with ILI were the 
most frequent users of OOH services during influenza periods.CONCLUSIONSThe autumn pandemic 
wave resulted in a significantly increased demand on primary care services. However, GPs in primary 
care services in Norway showed the ability to increase capacity in a situation with increased patient 
demand.

OBJECTIVESSince few pandemics have occurred since the Spanish influenza pandemic, we should 
learn from every (mild) pandemic that occurs. The objective of this study was to report on general 
practitioners’ and practice assistants’ acceptance of the chosen national policy, and experiences in 
the Netherlands during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic.METHODSData on experience and 
acceptance of the chosen national policy were obtained by structured questionnaires for general 
practitioners (n = 372) and practice assistants (n = 503) in April 2010.RESULTSThe primary policy 
chosen for general practice was not always accepted and complied with by general practitioners, 
although the communication (of changes) and collaboration with involved organisations were rated 
as positive. In particular, the advised personal protective measures were difficult to implement in 
daily work and thus not executed by 44% of general practitioners. Half of the general practitioners 
were not satisfied with the patient information provided by the government. The influenza A(H1N1) 
pandemic highly impacted on general practitioners’ and practice assistants’ workloads, which was 
not always deemed to be adequately compensated.DISCUSSIONInvolvement of general practitioners 
in future infectious disease outbreaks is essential. This study addresses issues in the pandemic policy 
which might be critical in a more severe pandemic.
