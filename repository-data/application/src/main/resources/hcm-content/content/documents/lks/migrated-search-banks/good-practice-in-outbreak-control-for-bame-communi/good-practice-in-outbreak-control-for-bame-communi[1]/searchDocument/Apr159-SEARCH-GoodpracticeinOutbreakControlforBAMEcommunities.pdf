Disparities in the risk and outcomes of COVID-19. (2020)  

Available online at this link  

This is a descriptive review of data on disparities in the risk and outcomes from COVID19. This 
review presents findings based on surveillance data available to PHE at the time of its publication, 
including through linkage to broader health data sets. It confirms that the impact of COVID-19 has 
replicated existing health inequalities and, in some cases, has increased them. These results 
improve our understanding of the pandemic and will help in formulating the future public health 
response to it.

This Plan is designed to ensure that Manchester City Council, working with all key partner 
organisations in the City can respond effectively to the gradual easing of lockdown measures over 
the next few months. •It has been developed collaboratively in line with the Our Manchester 
principles and behaviours and has a strong focus on preventing further transmission of the virus as 
well as setting out the actions that will be taken should local outbreaks occur. •From the outset we 
also worked with and provided support to Manchester’s Chinese community, who were being 
unfairly stigmatised at the time. • This focus on community - and also groups who may be more at 
risk of the virus - is fundamental to our approach.

This plan is primarily about controlling outbreaks, however preventing spread of the virus is still 
critically important to prevent localised outbreaks and to avoid a second wave of the pandemic. 
Surrey residents need to continue to follow national guidance on staying at home if symptomatic, 
social distancing, washing hands, and using face coverings in public places. The communications 
plan will address how to encourage the public to follow this guidance.

3. Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in impoverished area: Liangshan Yi autonomous 
prefecture as an example. 
Liao Ru-Jun Infectious diseases of poverty 2020;9(1):112.  

BACKGROUNDThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had spread 
worldwide. Although the world has intensively focused on the epidemic center during this 
period of time, it is imperative to emphasize that more attention should also be paid to 
some impoverished areas in China since they are more vulnerable to disease outbreak due 
to their weak health service capacities. Therefore, this study took Liangshan Yi 
Autonomous Prefecture as an example to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the 
impoverished area, evaluate the control effect and explore future control 
strategies.METHODSIn this study, we collected information including age, gender, 
nationality, occupation, and address of all COVID-19 cases reported from 25 January 2020 
to 23 April 2020 in Liangshan Prefecture from the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases 
Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), which were used under license and not publicly 
available. Additionally, we retrieved other information of cases through epidemiological 
investigation reports reviewing. Data were analyzed using the software Excel 2010 and 
SPSS 17.0. The geographic distribution of cases was mapped using 
ArcGIS10.2.RESULTSBy 23 April 2020, a total of 13 COVID-19 cases and two 
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were reported in Liangshan, in three family clusters. 
Among the cases, eight cases had a history of sojourning in Hubei Province (61.54%), of 
which six were related to Wuhan. Cases aged under 44 years accounted for 61.54%, with 
no child case. The delay of patients' hospital visiting, and the low degree of cooperation in 
epidemiological investigation are problems.CONCLUSIONSDuring the study period, 
Liangshan was well under control. This was mainly contributed to strict preventive 
strategies aimed at local culture, inter-sectoral coordination and highly degree of public 
cooperation. Besides, some possible environmentally and culturally preventive factors (e.g., 
rapid air flow and family concept) would affect disease prevention and control. In the next 
step, the health education about COVID-19 should be strengthened and carried out 
according to the special culture of ethnic minorities to enhance public awareness of timely 
medical treatment.

Recent novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan City of Hubei province in China infected 
nearly 70,000 individuals and killed more than 1700 people within a short span of time 
leading to global pandemic. The disease is now spread to 26 countries in Asia, North 
America, Europe and Australasia. The virus is spreading rapidly to Asia-pacific and

Southeast Asian countries. The disease is posing a serious threat to human population and 
has devastating impact on public health and economy. So far 3 Indians are infected and 
India is at risk of rapid spread of the disease because of its geographical location and other 
favorable conditions. With a poorer global health security index compared to China (India-
57 and China-51), any such situation will have worse outcome. In near future there are also 
possibilities of similar kind of disease outbreak caused by new strains of coronaviruses due 
to factors like species jump of new viruses, high population density and inadequate medical 
facilities. In this short review we have highlighted the risk factors and transmission 
dynamics of coronaviruses that may pose a serious threat to India. We have also discussed 
about the possible preventive measure our country should take to control any such 
outbreak situation.

there are limited data on health information, beliefs, and behaviors that might indicate 
different exposure to risk.ObjectiveTo determine the association of sociodemographic 
characteristics with reported incidence, knowledge, and behavior regarding COVID-19 
among US adults.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA US national survey study was 
conducted from March 29 to April 13, 2020, to measure differences in knowledge, beliefs, 
and behavior about COVID-19. The survey oversampled COVID-19 hotspot areas. The 
survey was conducted electronically. The criteria for inclusion were age 18 years or older 
and residence in the US. Data analysis was performed in April 2020.Main Outcomes and 
MeasuresThe main outcomes were incidence, knowledge, and behaviors related to COVID-
19 as measured by survey response.ResultsThe survey included 5198 individuals (mean 
[SD] age, 48 [18] years; 2336 men [45%]; 3759 white [72%], 830 [16%] African American, 
and 609 [12%] Hispanic). The largest differences in COVID-19-related knowledge and 
behaviors were associated with race/ethnicity, sex, and age, with African American 
participants, men, and people younger than 55 years showing less knowledge than other 
groups. African American respondents were 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 1.5 to 5.5 
percentage points; P = .001) more likely than white respondents to report being infected 
with COVID-19, as were men compared with women (3.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.0 to 
4.4 percentage points; P < .001). Knowing someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was 
more common among African American respondents (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 
10.9 percentage points; P < .001), people younger than 30 years (11.6 percentage points; 
95% CI, 7.5 to 15.7 percentage points; P < .001), and people with higher incomes 
(coefficient on earning ≥$100 000, 12.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 8.7 to 15.8 percentage 
points; P < .001). Knowledge of potential fomite spread was lower among African American 
respondents (-9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -13.1 to -5.7 percentage points; P < .001), 
Hispanic respondents (-4.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -8.9 to -0.77 percentage points; 
P = .02), and people younger than 30 years (-10.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -14.1 to -6.5 
percentage points; P < .001). Similar gaps were found with respect to knowledge of COVID-
19 symptoms and preventive behaviors.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this survey study of 
US adults, there were gaps in reported incidence of COVID-19 and knowledge regarding its 
spread and symptoms and social distancing behavior. More effort is needed to increase 
accurate information and encourage appropriate behaviors among minority communities, 
men, and younger people.

9. Estimation of reproduction numbers of COVID-19 in typical countries and epidemic 
trends under different prevention and control scenarios. 
Xu C. Frontiers of medicine 2020;:No page numbers.  

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a life-threatening pandemic. The 
epidemic trends in different countries vary considerably due to different policy-making and 
resources mobilization. We calculated basic reproduction number (R0) and the time-varying 
estimate of the effective reproductive number (Rt) of COVID-19 by using the maximum 
likelihood method and the sequential Bayesian method, respectively. European and North 
American countries possessed higher R0 and unsteady Rt fluctuations, whereas some 
heavily affected Asian countries showed relatively low R0 and declining Rt now. The 
numbers of patients in Africa and Latin America are still low, but the potential risk of huge 
outbreaks cannot be ignored. Three scenarios were then simulated, generating distinct 
outcomes by using SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model. First, 
evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing Rt. 
Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of

huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation. Third, wisely 
taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to 
adopt adequate measures can save more people's life. Our mathematical modeling 
provides evidence for international communities to develop sound design of containment 
and mitigation policies for COVID-19.

10. Failure in initial stage containment of global COVID-19 epicenters. 
Khosrawipour V. Journal of medical virology 2020;92(7):863-867.  

With multiple virus epicenters, COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World 
Health Organization. Consequently, many countries have implemented different policies to 
manage this crisis including curfew and lockdown. However, the efficacy of individual 
policies remains unclear with respect to COVID-19 case development. We analyzed 
available data on COVID-19 cases of eight majorly affected countries, including China, 
Italy, Iran, Germany, France, Spain, South Korea, and Japan. Growth rates and doubling 
time of cases were calculated for the first 6 weeks after the initial cases were declared for 
each respective country and put into context with implemented policies. Although the 
growth rate of total confirmed COVID-19 cases in China has decreased, those for Japan 
have remained constant. For European countries, the growth rate of COVID-19 cases 
considerably increased during the second time interval. Interestingly, the rates for 
Germany, Spain, and France are the highest measured in the second interval and even 
surpass the numbers in Italy. Although the initial data in Asian countries are encouraging 
with respect to case development at the initial stage, the opposite is true for European 
countries. Based on our data, disease management in the 2 weeks following the first 
reported cases is of utmost importance.

11. How Is Morocco Reacting to COVID-19 Crisis in Anticancer Centers? 
Oualla Karima Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center 
2020;27(3):1073274820941973.  

The world is facing the pandemic linked to COVID-19 virus infection that has rapidly spread 
worldwide, and severe complications have been reported to occur in around a third of 
patients. To date, there is no approved vaccine or specific therapy against COVID-19, but 
many trials are ongoing with some of them showing promising results. It has been shown 
recently that patients with cancer are at high risk of infection and they are more susceptible 
to develop severe events such as the necessity of invasive ventilation and death. 
Therefore, this crisis presents a real challenge for health systems especially in low- and 
middle-income countries where the health systems are already fragile such as African 
countries. In this article, we describe the epidemiological situation of the infection in 
Morocco and the different challenges in cancer centers in the era of COVID-19, in addition 
to various strategies that have been implemented to prevent and control the infection 
spread in oncological units in order to ensure the continuation of adequate cancer care.

12. Identifying and combating the impacts of COVID-19 on malaria. 
Rogerson Stephen J. BMC medicine 2020;18(1):239.  

BACKGROUNDThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of infections, hundreds of 
thousands of deaths and major societal disruption due to lockdowns and other restrictions 
introduced to limit disease spread. Relatively little attention has been paid to understanding 
how the pandemic has affected treatment, prevention and control of malaria, which is a 
major cause of death and disease and predominantly affects people in less well-resourced 
settings.MAIN BODYRecent successes in malaria control and elimination have reduced the 
global malaria burden, but these gains are fragile and progress has stalled in the past 
5 years. Withdrawing successful interventions often results in rapid malaria resurgence, 
primarily threatening vulnerable young children and pregnant women. Malaria programmes 
are being affected in many ways by COVID-19. For prevention of malaria, insecticide-
treated nets need regular renewal, but distribution campaigns have been delayed or 
cancelled. For detection and treatment of malaria, individuals may stop attending health 
facilities, out of fear of exposure to COVID-19, or because they cannot afford transport, and 
health care workers require additional resources to protect themselves from COVID-19. 
Supplies of diagnostics and drugs are being interrupted, which is compounded by 
production of substandard and falsified medicines and diagnostics. These disruptions are 
predicted to double the number of young African children dying of malaria in the coming 
year and may impact efforts to control the spread of drug resistance. Using examples from 
successful malaria control and elimination campaigns, we propose strategies to re-establish 
malaria control activities and maintain elimination efforts in the context of the COVID-19 
pandemic, which is likely to be a long-term challenge. All sectors of society, including 
governments, donors, private sector and civil society organisations, have crucial roles to 
play to prevent malaria resurgence. Sparse resources must be allocated efficiently to 
ensure integrated health care systems that can sustain control activities against COVID-19 
as well as malaria and other priority infectious diseases.CONCLUSIONAs we deal with the 
COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial that other major killers such as malaria are not ignored. 
History tells us that if we do, the consequences will be dire, particularly in vulnerable 
populations.

Although social presence plays an essential role under general conditions, its role becomes 
significant for societal protection during the quarantine period in epidemic outbreak. In this 
study, we attempted to identify the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth in 
terms of their direct impact on online social presence during the outbreak as well as their 
impacts mediated by epidemic protection and attitudes toward epidemic outbreaks. For this 
purpose, a unique multi-mediation model is proposed to provide a new direction for 
research in the field of epidemic outbreaks and their control. Through random sampling, an 
online survey was conducted and data from 683participants were analyzed. Partial least 
squares structural equation modeling was used to test the relationships between the 
variables of interest. The study results revealed that the roles of E-government and COVID-
19 word of mouth are positively related to online social presence during the outbreak. 
Epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak were found to positively 
moderate the impact of the role of E-government and COVID-19 word of mouth on online 
social presence during the outbreak. The key findings of this study have both practical and 
academic implications.

14. Nepal's Response to Contain COVID-19 Infection. 
Piryani RM Journal of Nepal Health Research Council 2020;18(1):128-134.  

Nepal is a landlocked country bordering two most populous countries, India and China. 
Nepal shares open border with India from three sides, east, south and west. And, in north 
with China, where the novel coronavirus infection (CVOVID-19) began in late December 
2019. The first confirmed imported case in Nepal was reported in 2nd week of January 
2020. The initial response of Nepal to COVID-19 were comparably slow but country geared 
efforts after it was declared a 'global pandemic' by WHO on 11 March, 2020. Government 
of Nepal's steps from 18 March, 2020 led to partial lock down and countrywide lockdown 
imposed on 24 March, 2020. Government devised comprehensive plan on 27 March, 2020 
for quarantine for peoples who arrived in Nepal from COVID-19 affected countries. This 
article covers summary of global status, South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) status, and Nepal's response to contain COVID-19 infection discussed under 
three headings: Steps taken before and after WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic 
and lab services regarding detection of COVID-19. Nepal has documented five confirmed 
cases of COVID-19 till the end of March 2020, first in second week of 15 January, 2020 and 
2nd case 8-weeks thereafter and 3rd case two days later, 4th on 27 March and 5th on 28 
March. Four more cases detected during first week of April. Non-Pharmacological 
interventions like social distancing and excellent personal habits are widely practiced. 
Country has to enhance testing and strengthen tracing, isolation and quarantine 
mechanism and care of COVID-19 patients as Nepal is in risk zone because of comparably 
weak health system and porous borders with India. The time will tell regarding further 
outbreak and how it will be tackled. Keywords: COVID-19; lockdown; Nepal; pandemic; 
response.

15. Prediction of the COVID-19 spread in African countries and implications for 
prevention and control: A case study in South Africa, Egypt, Algeria, Nigeria, 
Senegal and Kenya. 
Zhao Zebin The Science of the total environment 2020;729:138959.  

COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is globally spreading and the international 
cooperation is urgently required in joint prevention and control of the epidemic. Using the 
Maximum-Hasting (MH) parameter estimation method and the modified Susceptible 
Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the spread of the epidemic under three 
intervention scenarios (suppression, mitigation, mildness) is simulated and predicted in 
South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria, where the epidemic situations are severe. The studies are 
also conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya, where the epidemic situations are growing 
rapidly and the socio-economic are relatively under-developed, resulting in more difficulties 
in preventing the epidemic. Results indicated that the epidemic can be basically controlled 
in late April with strict control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South 
Africa and Senegal. Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people 
will increase by 1.43-1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being 
controlled will be delayed by about 10 days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in 
accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic will be 
controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that in scenario two, 
and Egypt is in line with this prediction. In the end, a series of epidemic controlling methods 
are proposed, including patient quarantine, close contact tracing, population movement 
control, government intervention, city and county epidemic risk level classification, and 
medical cooperation and the Chinese assistance.

16. Real-time estimation and prediction of mortality caused by COVID-19 with patient 
information based algorithm. 
Wang L. The Science of the total environment 2020;727:138394.  

The global COVID-19 outbreak is worrisome both for its high rate of spread, and the high 
case fatality rate reported by early studies and now in Italy. We report a new methodology, 
the Patient Information Based Algorithm (PIBA), for estimating the death rate of a disease 
in real-time using publicly available data collected during an outbreak. PIBA estimated the 
death rate based on data of the patients in Wuhan and then in other cities throughout 
China. The estimated days from hospital admission to death was 13 (standard deviation 
(SD), 6 days). The death rates based on PIBA were used to predict the daily numbers of 
deaths since the week of February 25, 2020, in China overall, Hubei province, Wuhan city, 
and the rest of the country except Hubei province. The death rate of COVID-19 ranges from 
0.75% to 3% and may decrease in the future. The results showed that the real death 
numbers had fallen into the predicted ranges. In addition, using the preliminary data from 
China, the PIBA method was successfully used to estimate the death rate and predict the 
death numbers of the Korean population. In conclusion, PIBA can be used to efficiently 
estimate the death rate of a new infectious disease in real-time and to predict future deaths. 
The spread of 2019-nCoV and its case fatality rate may vary in regions with different 
climates and temperatures from Hubei and Wuhan. PIBA model can be built based on 
known information of early patients in different countries.

17. Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public. 
Li JB International journal of environmental research and public health 2020;17(13):No 
page numbers.  

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths in China. Prior 
research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of 
negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant 
research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience 
model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate 
the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data 
from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 
31 regions in China (Mage = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey 
at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after 
controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and 
self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. 
More importantly, self-control moderated the "perceived severity of COVID-19-mental 
health problems" association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control 
increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals 
with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to 
maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing 
individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental 
health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.

18. Similarities and Differences in COVID-19 Awareness, Concern, and Symptoms by 
Race and Ethnicity in the United States: Cross-Sectional Survey. 
Jones J. Journal of medical Internet research 2020;22(7):e20001.  

<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Existing health disparities based on race and ethnicity 
in the United States are contributing to disparities in morbidity and mortality during the 
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted an online survey of American 
adults to assess similarities and differences by race and ethnicity with respect to COVID-19 
symptoms, estimates of the extent of the pandemic, knowledge of control measures, and 
stigma.<br /><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> The aim of this study was to describe 
similarities and differences in COVID-19 symptoms, knowledge, and beliefs by race and 
ethnicity among adults in the United States.<br /><strong>METHODS:</strong> We 
conducted a cross-sectional survey from March 27, 2020 through April 1, 2020. Participants 
were recruited on social media platforms and completed the survey on a secure web-based 
survey platform. We used chi-square tests to compare characteristics related to COVID-19 
by race and ethnicity. Statistical tests were corrected using the Holm Bonferroni correction 
to account for multiple comparisons.<br /><strong>RESULTS:</strong> A total of 1435 
participants completed the survey; 52 (3.6%) were Asian, 158 (11.0%) were non-Hispanic 
Black, 548 (38.2%) were Hispanic, 587 (40.9%) were non-Hispanic White, and 90 (6.3%)

identified as other or multiple races. Only one symptom (sore throat) was found to be 
different based on race and ethnicity (P=.003); this symptom was less frequently reported 
by Asian (3/52, 5.8%), non-Hispanic Black (9/158, 5.7%), and other/multiple race (8/90, 
8.9%) participants compared to those who were Hispanic (99/548, 18.1%) or non-Hispanic 
White (95/587, 16.2%). Non-Hispanic White and Asian participants were more likely to 
estimate that the number of current cases was at least 100,000 (P=.004) and were more 
likely to answer all 14 COVID-19 knowledge scale questions correctly (Asian participants, 
13/52, 25.0%; non-Hispanic White participants, 180/587, 30.7%) compared to Hispanic 
(108/548, 19.7%) and non-Hispanic Black (25/158, 15.8%) participants.<br 
/><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> We observed differences with respect to knowledge 
of appropriate methods to prevent infection by the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-
19. Deficits in knowledge of proper control methods may further exacerbate existing 
race/ethnicity disparities. Additional research is needed to identify trusted sources of 
information in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black communities and create effective 
messaging to disseminate correct COVID-19 prevention and treatment information.

19. Singapore COVID-19 Pandemic Response as a Successful Model Framework for 
Low-Resource Health Care Settings in Africa? 
Kuguyo O. Omics : a journal of integrative biology 2020;24(8):470-478.  

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continues to spread and evolve 
across the planet. The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the 
virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the 
world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and 
adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article 
analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that 
adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional 
differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast 
population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned 
in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, 
ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in 
low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is 
also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future

mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century. Hence, 
what we learn effectively from the current COVID-19 pandemic shall have broad, enduring, 
and intergenerational relevance for the future of planetary heath and society.

21. Syndemic Perspectives to Guide Black Maternal Health Research and Prevention 
During the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
Lemke MK Maternal and child health journal 2020;24(9):1093-1098.  

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related policies have led to an unequal 
distribution of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. For Black women and birthing people, 
endemic vulnerabilities and disparities may exacerbate deleterious COVID-19 impacts. 
Historical and ongoing macro-level policies and forces over time have induced 
disproportionately higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality among Black women 
and birthing people, and contemporary macroeconomic and healthcare policies and factors 
continue to hold particular consequence. These factors induce detrimental psychological, 
health, and behavioral responses that contribute to maternal health disparities. The COVID-
19 pandemic is likely to disproportionately impact Black women and birthing people, as 
policy responses have failed to account for the their unique socioeconomic and healthcare 
contexts. The resulting consequences may form a 'vicious cycle', with upstream impacts 
that exacerbate upstream macro-level policies and forces that can further perpetuate the 
clustering of maternal morbidity and mortality in this population. Understanding the impacts 
of COVID-19 among Black women and birthing people requires theoretical frameworks that 
can sufficiently conceptualize their multi-level, interacting, and dynamic nature. Thus, we 
advocate for the proliferation of syndemic perspectives to guide maternal disparities 
research and prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. These perspectives can enable a 
holistic and nuanced understanding of the intersection of endemic and COVID-19-specific 
vulnerabilities and disparities experienced by Black women and birthing people. Syndemic-
informed research can then lead to impactful multi-level prevention strategies that 
simultaneously tackle both endemic and COVID-19-specific factors and outcomes that lead 
to the clustering of vulnerabilities and disparities over time.

22. The COVID-19 Pandemic: a Call to Action to Identify and Address Racial and Ethnic 
Disparities. 
Laurencin Cato T. Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities 2020;7(3):398-402.  

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted and 
devastated the world. As the infection spreads, the projected mortality and economic 
devastation are unprecedented. In particular, racial and ethnic minorities may be at a 
particular disadvantage as many already assume the status of a marginalized group. Black 
Americans have a long-standing history of disadvantage and are in a vulnerable position to 
experience the impact of this crisis and the myth of Black immunity to COVID-19 is 
detrimental to promoting and maintaining preventative measures. We are the first to 
present the earliest available data in the peer-reviewed literature on the racial and ethnic 
distribution of COVID-19-confirmed cases and fatalities in the state of Connecticut. We also 
seek to explode the myth of Black immunity to the virus. Finally, we call for a National 
Commission on COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities to further explore and 
respond to the unique challenges that the crisis presents for Black and Brown communities.

23. The potential effects of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 
infection in the World Health Organization African Region: a predictive model. 
Cabore Joseph Waogodo BMJ global health 2020;5(5):No page numbers.  

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been 
unprecedented in its speed and effects. Interruption of its transmission to prevent 
widespread community transmission is critical because its effects go beyond the number of 
COVID-19 cases and deaths and affect the health system capacity to provide other 
essential services. Highlighting the implications of such a situation, the predictions 
presented here are derived using a Markov chain model, with the transition states and 
country specific probabilities derived based on currently available knowledge. A risk of 
exposure, and vulnerability index are used to make the probabilities country specific. The 
results predict a high risk of exposure in states of small size, together with Algeria, South 
Africa and Cameroon. Nigeria will have the largest number of infections, followed by Algeria 
and South Africa. Mauritania would have the fewest cases, followed by Seychelles and 
Eritrea. Per capita, Mauritius, Seychelles and Equatorial Guinea would have the highest 
proportion of their population affected, while Niger, Mauritania and Chad would have the 
lowest. Of the World Health Organization's 1 billion population in Africa, 22% (16%-26%) 
will be infected in the first year, with 37 (29 - 44) million symptomatic cases and 150 078 
(82 735-189 579) deaths. There will be an estimated 4.6 (3.6-5.5) million COVID-19 
hospitalisations, of which 139 521 (81 876-167 044) would be severe cases requiring 
oxygen, and 89 043 (52 253-106 599) critical cases requiring breathing support. The 
needed mitigation measures would significantly strain health system capacities, particularly 
for secondary and tertiary services, while many cases may pass undetected in primary care 
facilities due to weak diagnostic capacity and non-specific symptoms. The effect of avoiding 
widespread and sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is significant, and most 
likely outweighs any costs of preventing such a scenario. Effective containment measures 
should be promoted in all countries to best manage the COVID-19 pandemic.

24. Translation of genomic epidemiology of infectious pathogens: Enhancing African 
genomics hubs for outbreaks. 
Oboh MA International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the 
International Society for Infectious Diseases 2020;:No page numbers.  

<strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> Deadly emerging infectious pathogens place 
unprecedented challenge on health systems and economies, especially across Africa 
where health care infrastructures are weak, and poverty rates remain high. Genomic 
technologies have been vital in enhancing the understanding and development of 
intervention approaches against these, such as Ebola, and recently the novel coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19).<br /><strong>DISCUSSION:</strong> Africa has contributed a 
limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to the global pool in growing open access 
repositories. To bridge this gap, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 
(ACDC) is coordinating initiatives across the continent to establish genomic hubs in

selected well-resourced African centres of excellence. This will allow for standardisation, 
efficient and rapid data generation and curation. However, the strategy to ensure capacity 
for high-throughput genomics at selected genomics hubs should not overshadow the 
deployment of portable, field-friendly and technically less demanding genomics 
technologies in all affected countries. This will enhance small scale local genomic 
surveillance in outbreaks, leaving validation and large-scale approaches at central genomic 
hubs.<br /><strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> The ACDC needs to scale-up its campaign 
for government support across African Union countries to ensure sustainable financing of 
its strategy for increased pathogen genomic intelligence and other interventions in current 
and inevitable future epidemics in Africa.

26. What works and what does not work in response to COVID-19 prevention and control 
in Africa. 
Rutayisire Erigene International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of 
the International Society for Infectious Diseases 2020;97:267-269.  

Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, 
there have been nearly 6,663,304 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 392,802 deaths, 
worldwide as of 10:00 CEST 06 June 2020. In Africa, 152,442 COVID-19 cases and 4334 
deaths have been reported as of 02 June 2020. The five countries with the highest 
commutative number of cases in Africa are South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Algeria, and 
Ghana. Africa, and the rest of world, has had to swiftly undertake the necessary measures 
to protect the continent from irreversible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that is claiming 
lives and destroying livelihoods. The lower number of COVID-19 cases in most African 
countries is attributed to inadequate health systems, low-to-absent testing capacity, poor 
reporting systems, and insufficient numbers of medical staff. The COVID-19 pandemic 
poses a great threat to most African countries, from cities to rural areas, and has created a 
strong demand on already scarce resources. Intense mobilization of additional resources is 
required to implement established emergency contingency measures. Measures to prevent 
the spread of COVID-19 include closure of borders and restricting movement of people 
within a country; this has resulted in the tourism sector being adversely affected by the loss 
of income. Cooperative prevention and control measures are one of the promising solutions 
to deplete the spread of COVID-19 on the continent.

27. Whole Genome Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2: Adapting Illumina Protocols for Quick 
and Accurate Outbreak Investigation during a Pandemic. 
Pillay S. Genes 2020;11(8):No page numbers.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread very fast around the world. A few days after the first 
detected case in South Africa, an infection started in a large hospital outbreak in Durban, 
KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). Phylogenetic analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes can be used to trace the path of transmission within 
a hospital. It can also identify the source of the outbreak and provide lessons to improve 
infection prevention and control strategies. This manuscript outlines the obstacles 
encountered in order to genotype SARS-CoV-2 in near-real time during an urgent outbreak 
investigation. This included problems with the length of the original genotyping protocol, 
unavailability of reagents, and sample degradation and storage. Despite this, three different 
library preparation methods for Illumina sequencing were set up, and the hands-on library 
preparation time was decreased from twelve to three hours, which enabled the outbreak 
investigation to be completed in just a few weeks. Furthermore, the new protocols 
increased the success rate of sequencing whole viral genomes. A simple bioinformatics 
workflow for the assembly of high-quality genomes in near-real time was also fine-tuned. In 
order to allow other laboratories to learn from our experience, all of the library preparation 
and bioinformatics protocols are publicly available at protocols.io and distributed to other 
laboratories of the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) 
consortium.
