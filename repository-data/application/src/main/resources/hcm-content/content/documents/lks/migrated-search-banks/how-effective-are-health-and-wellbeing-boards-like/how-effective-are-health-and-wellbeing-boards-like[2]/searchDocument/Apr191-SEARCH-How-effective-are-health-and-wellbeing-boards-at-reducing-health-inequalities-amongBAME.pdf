Summary of Results 

A thorough search was conducted on HDAS databases including Medline and HMIC and NHS, UK 
Government and Local authority websites as well as other grey literature sources.   The search 
yielded many useful resources.  Few resources were found on 'wicked issues' and NPM within the 
years specified.  I have included two of titles on the topics published before 2012 which look very 
useful.  You may want to look at the following titles as 'first reads':

take a collaborative approach to building our wider work on cohesion and equalities. As a result, 
we have launched a project looking into how disproportionality is affecting our Black, Asian and 
minority ethnic residents locally and what actions we must take to protect people.

LGA: health and wellbeing boards are achieving their goal (2019)  

Available online at this link  

The report, based on 22 effective HWBs across the country, shows the boards are driving health 
and social care integration and making sure that prevention is at the heart of this - helping to keep 
people well in the first place, rather than managing ill health better. 

 

Health and wellbeing systems (2020)  

Available online at this link  

Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) are a statutory forum where political, clinical, professional 
and community leaders from across the care and health system come together to improve the 
health and wellbeing of their local population and reduce health inequalities. They have been in 
place since 2013 and are a single point of continuity in a constantly shifting health and care 
landscape.

and implementing constitutional and governance aspects of the legislation. It has no statutory 
standing, nor does it constitute non-statutory guidance. The examples we use in the guide are 
intended to cover a range of possible ways of addressing constitutional and other issues and to

Mckinsey and Company 

Problems amid progress: Improving lives and livelihoods for ethnic minorities in the United 
Kingdom (2020)  

Available online at this link  

The economic and social progress of Britain’s ethnic minorities is real. The risk is that the 
disproportionate health and economic effects of COVID-19 and the looming disruptions due to 
global economic trends could set it back. We hope that this research helps communities, social 
enterprises, businesses, and government focus on how to avoid that outcome and, instead, to 
consolidate existing strengths and accelerate improvements. Tracking progress and collecting data 
are the essential foundation. 

 

 

NHS Confederation 

Tackling health inequalities in Suffolk and North East Essex (2020)  

Available online at this link  

Suffolk and North East Essex ICS has shared how it is currently tackling health inequalities in the 
region. By taking an agile approach to tackling health inequalities as a whole system, the ICS has 
adopted an outcome-based approach that has set them in good stead to support communities 
affected by COVID-19. Links to Shared learning reports from Cheshire and Merseyside Health and 
Care Partnership and West Yorkshire and Harrogate Health and Care Partnership.  

 

Health inequalities: time to act (2020)  

Available online at this link  

This report reflects engagement with NHS Confederation members, gleaned from focused 
discussions and webinars between June and September 2020. It also draws on the results of a 
member survey of more than 200 healthcare leaders on health inequalities and how to make 
progress in this area.

Health inequalities are avoidable and unfair differences in health status between groups of people 
or communities. Our health is determined by our genetics, our lifestyle, the health care we receive 
and the impact of wider determinants. Such as our physical, social and economic environment 
including, for example, education and employment, as identified by Dahlgren and Whitehead(5) in 
their seminal diagram.

This is a descriptive review of data on disparities in the risk and outcomes from COVID19. This 
review presents findings based on surveillance data available to PHE at the time of its publication, 
including through linkage to broader health data sets. It confirms that the impact of COVID-19 has 
replicated existing health inequalities and, in some cases, has increased them. These results 
improve our understanding of the pandemic and will help in formulating the future public health 
response to it.

C. Original Research 

1. A latent class approach to inequity in health using biomarker data 
Carrieri Vincenzo Health Economics 2020;29(7):808-826.  

We adopt an empirical approach to analyse, measure and decompose inequality of 
opportunity (IOp) in health, based on a latent class model. This addresses some of the 
limitations that affect earlier work in this literature concerning the definition of types, such as 
partial observability, the ad hoc selection of circumstances, the curse of dimensionality and 
unobserved type-specific heterogeneity that may lead to biased estimates of IOp. We apply 
our latent class approach to measure IOp in allostatic load, a composite measure of 
biomarker data. Using data from Understanding Society: The UK Household Longitudinal 
Study (UKHLS), we find that a latent class model with three latent types best fits the data, 
with the corresponding types characterised in terms of differences in their observed 
circumstances. Decomposition analysis shows that about two thirds of the total inequalities 
in allostatic load can be attributed to the direct and indirect contribution of circumstances 
and that the direct contribution of effort is small. Further analysis conditional on age-sex 
groups reveals that the relative (percentage) contribution of circumstances to the total 
inequalities remains mostly unaffected and the direct contribution of effort remains small.

Modulation by Racial Discrimination Stress. 
Anderson George Biology 2020;9(9):No page numbers.  

There is an under-recognized role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in co-ordinating 
the entry and pathophysiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) that underpins the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in pro-inflammatory 
cytokines during the 'cytokine storm' induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leading to 
an increase in kynurenine that activates the AhR, thereby heightening the initial pro-
inflammatory cytokine phase and suppressing the endogenous anti-viral response. Such 
AhR-driven changes underpin the heightened severity and fatality associated with pre-
existent high-risk medical conditions, such as type II diabetes, as well as to how racial 
discrimination stress contributes to the raised severity/fatality in people from the Black 
Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities. The AhR is pivotal in modulating 
mitochondrial metabolism and co-ordinating specialized, pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), 
the melatonergic pathways, acetyl-coenzyme A, and the cyclooxygenase (COX) 2-
prostaglandin (PG) E2 pathway that underpin 'exhaustion' in the endogenous anti-viral 
cells, paralleling similar metabolic suppression in cytolytic immune cells that is evident 
across all cancers. The pro-inflammatory cytokine induced gut permeability/dysbiosis and 
suppression of pineal melatonin are aspects of the wider pathophysiological underpinnings 
regulated by the AhR. This has a number of prophylactic and treatment implications for 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancers and future research directions that better investigate 
the biological underpinnings of social processes and how these may drive health 
disparities.

3. Association of race, ethnicity, and community-level factors with COVID-19 cases and 
deaths across U.S. counties. 
Figueroa Jose F. Healthcare (Amsterdam, Netherlands) 2020;9(1):100495.  

The United States currently has one of the highest numbers of cumulative COVID-19 cases 
globally, and Latino and Black communities have been disproportionately affected. 
Understanding the community-level factors that contribute to disparities in COVID-19 case 
and death rates is critical to developing public health and policy strategies. We performed a 
cross-sectional analysis of U.S. counties and found that a 10% point increase in the Black 
population was associated with 324.7 additional COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population 
and 14.5 additional COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. In addition, we found that a 10% point 
increase in the Latino population was associated with 293.5 additional COVID-19 cases per 
100,000 and 7.6 additional COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher 
COVID-19 case rates included average household size, the share of individuals with less 
than a high school diploma, and the percentage of foreign-born non-citizens. In addition, 
average household size, the share of individuals with less than a high school diploma, and 
the proportion of workers that commute using public transportation independently predicted 
higher COVID-19 death rates within a community. After adjustment for these variables, the 
association between the Latino population and COVID-19 cases and deaths was 
attenuated while the association between the Black population and COVID-19 cases and 
deaths largely persisted. Policy efforts must seek to address the drivers identified in this 
study in order to mitigate disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths across minority 
communities.

4. Community-Level Factors Associated With Racial And Ethnic Disparities In COVID-
19 Rates In Massachusetts. 
Figueroa Jose F. Health affairs (Project Hope) 2020;39(11):1984-1992.  

Massachusetts has one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US. Understanding which specific demographic, economic, 
and occupational factors have contributed to disparities in COVID-19 incidence rates 
across the state is critical to informing public health strategies. We performed a cross-
sectional study of 351 Massachusetts cities and towns from January 1 to May 6, 2020, and 
found that a 10-percentage-point increase in the Black non-Latino population was 
associated with an increase of 312.3 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population, whereas a 
10-percentage-point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 
258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the 
proportion of foreign-born noncitizens living in a community, mean household size, and 
share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association 
between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the 
association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted but may be 
explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for 
foreign-born noncitizens, address crowded housing, and protect food service workers may 
help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities.

5. Coronavirus (COVID-19) and Racial Disparities: a Perspective Analysis. 
Louis-Jean James Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities 2020;7(6):1039-1045.  

Health disparity refers to systematic differences in health outcomes between groups and 
communities based on socioeconomic isolation. In the USA, health disparities among 
minority groups, especially African Americans, limit their access to quality medical care and 
other beneficial resources and services. Presently, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 
highlights the extreme healthcare challenges that exist in the African American and other 
minority communities in the USA. African Americans are dying at a rate nearly four times 
higher than the national average. With inadequate access to quality healthcare, viable 
resources, and information, COVID-19 will continue to have a disastrous effect on African 
American communities. This communication provides a brief overview of the health 
inequalities resulting in African Americans dying disproportionately during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

ILFORD, UK: NELFT Library and Knowledge Service.  

BACKGROUNDThe United States has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Understanding micro-level patterns in US rates of COVID-19 can inform specific prevention 
strategies.METHODSUsing a negative binomial mixed-effects regression model we 
evaluated the association between a broad set of US county-level sociodemographic, 
economic, and health-status-related characteristics and cumulative rates of laboratory-
confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths between January 22, 2020 and August 31, 
2020.RESULTSRates of COVID-19 cases and deaths were higher in US counties that were 
more urban or densely-populated or that had more crowded housing, air pollution, women, 
20-49-year-olds, racial/ethnic minorities, residential segregation, income inequality, 
uninsured, diabetics, or mobility outside the home during the pandemic.CONCLUSIONSTo 
our knowledge, this study provides the most comprehensive multivariable analysis of 
county-level predictors of rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths conducted to date. Our 
findings make clear that ensuring that COVID-19 preventive measures, including vaccines 
when available, reach vulnerable and minority communities and are distributed in a manner 
that meaningfully disrupts transmission (in addition to protecting those at highest risk of 
severe disease) will likely be critical to stem the pandemic.

7. Covid-19 by Race and Ethnicity: A National Cohort Study of 6 Million United States 
Veterans. 
Rentsch Christopher T. medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences 2020;:No page 
numbers.  

BACKGROUNDThere is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities 
around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from 
symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Most studies 
investigating racial and ethnic disparities to date have focused on hospitalized patients or 
have not characterized who received testing or those who tested positive for Covid-
19.OBJECTIVETo compare patterns of testing and test results for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-
19) and subsequent mortality by race and ethnicity in the largest integrated healthcare 
system in the United States.DESIGNRetrospective cohort study.SETTINGUnited States 
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).PARTICIPANTS5,834,543 individuals in care, among 
whom 62,098 were tested and 5,630 tested positive for Covid-19 between February 8 and 
May 4, 2020. Exposures: Self-reported race/ethnicity.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESWe 
evaluated associations between race/ethnicity and receipt of Covid-19 testing, a positive 
test result, and 30-day mortality, accounting for a wide range of demographic and clinical 
risk factors including comorbid conditions, site of care, and urban versus rural 
residence.RESULTSAmong all individuals in care, 74% were non-Hispanic white (white), 
19% non-Hispanic black (black), and 7% Hispanic. Compared with white individuals, black 
and Hispanic individuals were more likely to be tested for Covid-19 (tests per 1000: 
white=9.0, [95% CI 8.9 to 9.1]; black=16.4, [16.2 to 16.7]; and Hispanic=12.2, [11.9 to 
12.5]). While individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (black 
vs white: OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.12; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.96), 
30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (black vs white: OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 
1.33; Hispanic vs white: OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87).CONCLUSIONSBlack and Hispanic

8. COVID-19 Pandemic: Exacerbating Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Long-Term Services 
and Supports. 
Shippee Tetyana P. Journal of aging & social policy 2020;32(4-5):323-333.  

What services are available and where racial and ethnic minorities receive long-term 
services and supports (LTSS) have resulted in a lower quality of care and life for 
racial/ethnic minority users. These disparities are only likely to worsen during the COVID-19 
pandemic, as the pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority 
communities both in the rate of infection and virus-related mortality. By examining these 
disparities in the context of the pandemic, we bring to light the challenges and issues faced 
in LTSS by minority communities with regard to this virus as well as the disparities in LTSS 
that have always existed.

9. COVID-19 treatment resource disparities and social disadvantage in New York City. 
Douglas Jason A. Preventive medicine 2020;141:106282.  

Black and Hispanic communities in the U.S. have endured a disproportionate burden of 
COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. Racial and ethnic health disparities such as 
these are frequently aggravated by inequitable access to healthcare resources in 
disadvantaged communities. Yet, no known studies have investigated disadvantaged 
communities' access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources. The current study 
accordingly examined racial and ethnic differences in (1) April 2020 COVID-19 total and 
positive viral test rates across 177 New York City (NYC) ZIP Code Tabulation Areas 
(ZCTA); and (2) November 2019-April 2020 licensed and intensive care unit (ICU) hospital 
bed access across 194 NYC ZCTAs. Pairwise analyses indicated higher COVID-19 total 
and positive test rates per 1000 persons in majority Black and Hispanic vs. majority White 
ZCTAs (CI [0.117, 4.55]; CI [2.53, 5.14]). Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that 
higher percentage of Black and Hispanic residents predicted more total COVID-19 tests per 
1000 persons (p < 0.05). In contrast, majority Black and Hispanic ZCTAs had fewer 
licensed and ICU beds (CI [6.50, 124.25]; CI [0.69, 7.16]), with social disadvantage 
predicting lower licensed and ICU bed access per 1000 persons (p < 0.01). While news 
reports of inequitable access to COVID-19-related healthcare resources in ethnocultural 
minority communities have emerged, this is the first study to reveal that social disadvantage 
may be a major driver of hospital resource inequities in Black and Hispanic communities. 
Thus, it will be imperative to enact policies that ensure equitable allocation of healthcare 
resources to socially disadvantaged communities to address current and future public 
health crises.

10. Disparities in Cancer Prevention in the COVID-19 Era. 
Carethers John M. Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.) 2020;13(11):893-896.  

Screening for cancer is a proven and recommended approach to prevent deaths from 
cancer; screening can locate precursor lesions and/or cancer at early stages when it is 
potentially curable. Racial and ethnic minorities and other medically underserved 
populations exhibit lower uptake of cancer screening than nonminorities in the United 
States. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities, 
has curtailed preventive services including cancer screening to preserve personal 
protective equipment and prevent spread of infection. While there is evidence for a rebound 
from the pandemic-driven reduction in cancer screening nationally, the return may not be 
even across all populations, with minority population screening that was already behind 
becoming further behind as a result of the community ravages from COVID-19. Fear of 
contracting COVID-19, limited access to safety-net clinics, and personal factors like, 
financial, employment, and transportation issues are concerns that are intensified in 
medically underserved communities. Prolonged delays in cancer screening will increase 
cancer in the overall population from pre-COVID-19 trajectories, and elevate the cancer 
disparity in minority populations. Knowing the overall benefit of cancer screening versus the 
risk of acquiring COVID-19, utilizing at-home screening tests and keeping the COVID-19-
induced delay in screening to a minimum might slow the growth of disparity.

BACKGROUNDHealth disparities are prevalent in many areas of medicine. We aimed to 
investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic groups in the United 
States (US) and to assess the effects of social distancing, social vulnerability metrics, and 
medical disparities.METHODSA cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from the 
COVID-19 Tracking Project and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Demographic data were obtained from the US Census Bureau, social vulnerability data 
were obtained from the CDC, social distancing data were obtained from Unacast, and 
medical disparities data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. A comparison 
of proportions by Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate differences between death rates 
stratified by age. Negative binomial regression analysis was used to predict COVID-19 
deaths based on social distancing scores, social vulnerability metrics, and medical 
disparities.RESULTSCOVID-19 cumulative infection and death rates were higher among 
minority racial/ethnic groups than whites across many states. Older age was also 
associated with increased cumulative death rates across all racial/ethnic groups on a 
national level, and many minority racial/ethnic groups experienced significantly greater 
cumulative death rates than whites within age groups ≥ 35 years. All studied racial/ethnic 
groups experienced higher hospitalization rates than whites. Older persons (≥ 65 years) 
also experienced more COVID-19 deaths associated with comorbidities than younger 
individuals. Social distancing factors, several measures of social vulnerability, and select 
medical disparities were identified as being predictive of county-level COVID-19 
deaths.CONCLUSIONCOVID-19 has disproportionately impacted many racial/ethnic 
minority communities across the country, warranting further research and intervention.

12. Historical Insights on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the 1918 Influenza 
Pandemic, and Racial Disparities: Illuminating a Path Forward. 
Krishnan Lakshmi Annals of internal medicine 2020;173(6):474-481.  

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is exacting a disproportionate toll on 
ethnic minority communities and magnifying existing disparities in health care access and 
treatment. To understand this crisis, physicians and public health researchers have 
searched history for insights, especially from a great outbreak approximately a century ago: 
the 1918 influenza pandemic. However, of the accounts examining the 1918 influenza 
pandemic and COVID-19, only a notable few discuss race. Yet, a rich, broader scholarship 
on race and epidemic disease as a "sampling device for social analysis" exists. This 
commentary examines the historical arc of the 1918 influenza pandemic, focusing on black 
Americans and showing the complex and sometimes surprising ways it operated, triggering 
particular responses both within a minority community and in wider racial, sociopolitical, 
and public health structures. This analysis reveals that critical structural inequities and 
health care gaps have historically contributed to and continue to compound disparate 
health outcomes among communities of color. Shifting from this context to the present, this 
article frames a discussion of racial health disparities through a resilience approach rather 
than a deficit approach and offers a blueprint for approaching the COVID-19 crisis and its 
afterlives through the lens of health equity.

13. Investigating the association between ethnicity and health outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 
in a London secondary care population. 
Patel Aatish PloS one 2020;15(10):e0240960.  

BACKGROUNDBlack, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations are emerging as a 
vulnerable group in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease (SARS-
CoV-2) pandemic. We investigated the relationship between ethnicity and health outcomes 
in SARS-CoV-2.METHODS AND FINDINGSWe conducted a retrospective, observational 
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 patients across two London teaching hospitals during March 1 -
April 30, 2020. Routinely collected clinical data were extracted and analysed for 645 
patients who met the study inclusion criteria. Within this hospitalised cohort, the BAME 
population were younger relative to the white population (61.70 years, 95% CI 59.70-63.73 
versus 69.3 years, 95% CI 67.17-71.43, p<0.001). When adjusted for age, sex and 
comorbidity, ethnicity was not a predictor for ICU admission. The mean age at death was 
lower in the BAME population compared to the white population (71.44 years, 95% CI 
69.90-72.90 versus, 77.40 years, 95% CI 76.1-78.70 respectively, p<0.001). When 
adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities, Asian patients had higher odds of death (OR 1.99: 
95% CI 1.22-3.25, p<0.006).CONCLUSIONSBAME patients were more likely to be 
admitted younger, and to die at a younger age with SARS-CoV-2. Within the BAME cohort, 
Asian patients were more likely to die but despite this, there was no difference in rates of 
admission to ICU. The reasons for these disparities are not fully understood and need to be 
addressed. Investigating ethnicity as a clinical risk factor remains a high public health 
priority. Studies that consider ethnicity as part of the wider socio-cultural determinant of 
health are urgently needed.

14. One country, two crises: what Covid-19 reveals about health inequalities among 
BAME communities in the United Kingdom and the sustainability of its health 
system? 
Otu Akaninyene International journal for equity in health 2020;19(1):189.  

There has been mounting evidence of the disproportionate involvement of black, Asian and 
minority ethnic (BAME) communities by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the UK, this racial 
disparity was brought to the fore by the fact that the first 11 doctors to die in the UK from 
Covid-19 were of BAME background. The mortality rate from Covid-19 among people of 
black African descent in English hospitals has been shown to be 3.5 times higher when 
compared to rates among white British people. A Public Health England report revealed 
that Covid-19 was more likely to be diagnosed among black ethnic groups compared to 
white ethnic groups with the highest mortality occurring among BAME persons and persons 
living in the more deprived areas. People of BAME background account for 4.5% of the 
English population and make up 21% of the National Health Service (NHS) workforce. The 
UK poverty rate among BAME populations is twice as high as for white groups. Also, 
people of BAME backgrounds are more likely to be engaged in frontline roles. The 
disproportionate involvement of BAME communities by Covid-19 in the UK illuminates 
perennial inequalities within the society and reaffirms the strong association between 
ethnicity, race, socio-economic status and health outcomes. Potential reasons for the 
observed differences include the overrepresentation of BAME persons in frontline roles, 
unequal distribution of socio-economic resources, disproportionate risks to BAME staff 
within the NHS workspace and high ethnic predisposition to certain diseases which have 
been linked to poorer outcomes with Covid-19. The ethnoracialised differences in health 
outcomes from Covid-19 in the UK require urgent remedial measures. We provide 
intersectional approaches to tackle the complex racial disparities which though not entirely 
new in itself, have been often systematically ignored.

16. Patterns of COVID-19 testing and mortality by race and ethnicity among United 
States veterans: A nationwide cohort study. 
Rentsch Christopher T. PLoS medicine 2020;17(9):e1003379.  

BACKGROUNDThere is growing concern that racial and ethnic minority communities 
around the world are experiencing a disproportionate burden of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19). We investigated racial and ethnic disparities in patterns of COVID-19 testing (i.e., who 
received testing and who tested positive) and subsequent mortality in the largest integrated 
healthcare system in the United States.METHODS AND FINDINGSThis retrospective 
cohort study included 5,834,543 individuals receiving care in the US Department of 
Veterans Affairs; most (91%) were men, 74% were non-Hispanic White (White), 19% were 
non-Hispanic Black (Black), and 7% were Hispanic. We evaluated associations between 
race/ethnicity and receipt of COVID-19 testing, a positive test result, and 30-day mortality, 
with multivariable adjustment for a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics 
including comorbid conditions, health behaviors, medication history, site of care, and urban 
versus rural residence. Between February 8 and July 22, 2020, 254,595 individuals were 
tested for COVID-19, of whom 16,317 tested positive and 1,057 died. Black individuals 
were more likely to be tested (rate per 1,000 individuals: 60.0, 95% CI 59.6-60.5) than 
Hispanic (52.7, 95% CI 52.1-53.4) and White individuals (38.6, 95% CI 38.4-38.7). While 
individuals from minority backgrounds were more likely to test positive (Black versus White: 
odds ratio [OR] 1.93, 95% CI 1.85-2.01, p < 0.001; Hispanic versus White: OR 1.84, 95% 
CI 1.74-1.94, p < 0.001), 30-day mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity (Black versus 
White: OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80-1.17, p = 0.74; Hispanic versus White: OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.73-
1.34, p = 0.94). The disparity between Black and White individuals in testing positive for 
COVID-19 was stronger in the Midwest (OR 2.66, 95% CI 2.41-2.95, p < 0.001) than the 
West (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11-1.39, p < 0.001). The disparity in testing positive for COVID-
19 between Hispanic and White individuals was consistent across region, calendar time, 
and outbreak pattern. Study limitations include underrepresentation of women and a lack of 
detailed information on social determinants of health.CONCLUSIONSIn this nationwide 
study, we found that Black and Hispanic individuals are experiencing an excess burden of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection not entirely explained by underlying medical conditions or where 
they live or receive care. There is an urgent need to proactively tailor strategies to contain 
and prevent further outbreaks in racial and ethnic minority communities.

17. Post-New Public Management (NPM) and the Reconfiguration of Health Services in 
England 
Louise Dalingwater Observatoire de la société britannique 2020;16:1714.  

This paper explores how modernist governance has transformed the organization and 
delivery of public health services in England. It will consider the limitations of reconfiguring 
the NHS to comply with a business-like and consumer-oriented model, with particular 
attention given to the post-New Public Management reform wave which began in the late 
1990s.

18. Role of Social Determinants of Health in Widening Maternal and Child Health 
Disparities in the Era of Covid-19 Pandemic. 
Dongarwar Deepa International journal of MCH and AIDS 2020;9(3):316-319.  

We present a conceptual model that describes the social determinants of health (SDOH) 
pathways contributing to worse outcomes in minority maternal and child health (MCH) 
populations due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. We used International Classification of 
Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10) codes in the categories Z55-Z65 
to identify SDOH that potentially modulate MCH disparities. These SDOH pathways, 
coupled with pre-existing comorbidities, exert higher-than-expected burden of maternal-
fetal morbidity and mortality in minority communities. There is an urgent need for an 
increased infusion of resources to mitigate the effects of these SDOH and avert permanent 
truncation in quality and quantity of life among minorities following the COVID-19 pandemic.

19. Socio-demographic heterogeneity in the prevalence of COVID-19 during lockdown is 
associated with ethnicity and household size: Results from an observational cohort 
study. 
Martin Christopher A. EClinicalMedicine 2020;25:100466.  

BackgroundAccumulating evidence indicates that COVID-19 causes adverse outcomes in 
ethnic minority groups. However, little is known about the impact of ethnicity and household 
size on acquiring infection with SARS-CoV-2.MethodsWe undertook a retrospective cohort 
study, in Leicester (UK), of all individuals assessed for COVID-19 with polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) testing at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust between 1st March 
and 28th April 2020. We used logistic regression to identify sociodemographic, clinical and 
temporal factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity before/after 
lockdown.Findings971/4051 (24.0%) patients with suspected COVID-19 were found to be 
PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. PCR positivity was more common amongst individuals from 
ethnic minortiy backgrounds than their White counterparts (White 20.0%, South Asian 
37.5%, Black 36.1%, Other 32.2%; p<0.001 for all ethnic minority groups vs White). After 
adjustment, compared to White ethnicity, South Asian (aOR 2.44 95%CI 2.01, 2.97), Black 
(aOR 2.56 95%CI 1.71, 3.84) and Other (aOR 2.53 95%CI 1.74, 3.70) ethnicities were

20. The Color of COVID-19: Structural Racism and the Pandemic's Disproportionate 
Impact on Older Racial and Ethnic Minorities. 
Garcia Marc A. The journals of gerontology. Series B, Psychological sciences and social 
sciences 2020;:No page numbers.  

OBJECTIVESThe aim of this evidence-based theoretically informed essay is to provide an 
overview of how and why the COVID-19 outbreak is particularly detrimental for the health of 
older Black and Latinx adults.METHODSWe draw upon current events, academic literature, 
and numerous data sources to illustrate how biopsychosocial factors place older adults at 
higher risk for COVID-19 relative to younger adults, and how structural racism magnifies 
these risks for older Black and Latinx adults.RESULTSWe identify three proximate 
mechanisms through which structural racism operates as a fundamental cause of 
racial/ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 burden among older adults: (1) Risk of exposure; (2) 
Weathering processes; and (3) Health care access and quality.DISCUSSIONWhile the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, the racial/ethnic health 
inequalities among older adults it has exposed are long-standing and deeply rooted in 
structural racism within American society. This knowledge presents both challenges and 
opportunities for researchers and policymakers as they seek to address the needs of older 
adults. It is imperative that federal, state, and local governments collect and release 
comprehensive data on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by 
race/ethnicity and age to better gauge the impact of outbreak across minority communities. 
We conclude with a discussion of incremental steps to be taken to lessen the 
disproportionate burden of COVID-19 among older Black and Latinx adults, as well as the 
need for transformative actions that address structural racism in order to achieve population 
health equity.

ILFORD, UK: NELFT Library and Knowledge Service.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minority groups, 
with high rates of death in African American, Native American, and LatinX communities. 
While the mechanisms of these disparities are being investigated, they can be conceived 
as arising from biomedical factors as well as social determinants of health. Minority groups 
are disproportionately affected by chronic medical conditions and lower access to 
healthcare that may portend worse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, minority 
communities are more likely to experience living and working conditions that predispose 
them to worse outcomes. Underpinning these disparities are long-standing structural and 
societal factors that the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed. Clinicians can partner with 
patients and communities to reduce the short-term impact of COVID-19 disparities while 
advocating for structural change.

22. Unequal burdens: assessing the determinants of elevated COVID-19 case and death 
rates in New York City's racial/ethnic minority neighbourhoods. 
Do D. Phuong Journal of epidemiology and community health 2020;:No page numbers.  

BACKGROUNDThe disproportionate burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic 
minority communities has revealed glaring inequities. However, multivariate empirical 
studies investigating its determinants are still limited. We document variation in COVID-19 
case and death rates across different racial/ethnic neighbourhoods in New York City (NYC), 
the initial epicentre of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, and conduct a multivariate ecological 
analysis investigating how various neighbourhood characteristics might explain any 
observed disparities.METHODSUsing ZIP-code-level COVID-19 case and death data from 
the NYC Department of Health, demographic and socioeconomic data from the American 
Community Survey and health data from the Centers for Disease Control's 500 Cities 
Project, we estimated a series of negative binomial regression models to assess the 
relationship between neighbourhood racial/ethnic composition (majority non-Hispanic 
White, majority Black, majority Hispanic and Other-type), neighbourhood poverty, affluence, 
proportion of essential workers, proportion with pre-existing health conditions and 
neighbourhood COVID-19 case and death rates.RESULTSCOVID-19 case and death rates 
for majority Black, Hispanic and Other-type minority communities are between 24% and 
110% higher than those in majority White communities. Elevated case rates are completely 
accounted for by the larger presence of essential workers in minority communities but 
excess deaths in Black neighbourhoods remain unexplained in the final 
model.CONCLUSIONSThe unequal COVID-19 case burden borne by NYC's minority 
communities is closely tied to their representation among the ranks of essential workers. 
Higher levels of pre-existing health conditions are not a sufficient explanation for the 
elevated mortality burden observed in Black communities.

23. White Counties Stand Apart: The Primacy of Residential Segregation in COVID-19 
and HIV Diagnoses. 
Millett Gregorio A. AIDS patient care and STDs 2020;34(10):417-424.  

Emerging epidemiological data suggest that white Americans have a lower risk of acquiring 
COVID-19. Although many studies have pointed to the role of systemic racism in COVID-19 
racial/ethnic disparities, few studies have examined the contribution of racial segregation. 
Residential segregation is associated with differing health outcomes by race/ethnicity for 
various diseases, including HIV. This commentary documents differing HIV and COVID-19 
outcomes and service delivery by race/ethnicity and the crucial role of racial segregation. 
Using publicly available Census data, we divide US counties into quintiles by percentage of 
non-Hispanic white residents and examine HIV diagnoses and COVID-19 per 100,000 
population. HIV diagnoses decrease as the proportion of white residents increase across 
US counties. COVID-19 diagnoses follow a similar pattern: Counties with the highest 
proportion of white residents have the fewest cases of COVID-19 irrespective of geographic 
region or state political party inclination (i.e., red or blue states). Moreover, comparatively 
fewer COVID-19 diagnoses have occurred in primarily white counties throughout the 
duration of the US COVID-19 pandemic. Systemic drivers place racial minorities at greater 
risk for COVID-19 and HIV. Individual-level characteristics (e.g., underlying health 
conditions for COVID-19 or risk behavior for HIV) do not fully explain excess disease 
burden in racial minority communities. Corresponding interventions must use structural- 
and policy-level solutions to address racial and ethnic health disparities.

Minkoff Howard American journal of perinatology 2020;37(10):1052-1054.  

Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and maternal mortality disproportionately affect 
minorities. However, direct viral infection is not the only way that the former can affect the 
latter. Most adverse maternal events that end in hospitals have their genesis upstream in 
communities. Hospitals often represent a last opportunity to reverse a process that begins 
at a remove in space and time. The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream 
injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the 
need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach 
between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has 
grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity 
services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. 
For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal 
visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to 
people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential 
conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for 
departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Community-based organizations including legal 
professionals, health-home coordinators, and advocacy groups, surround almost every 
hospital, and can be willing partners with interested departments. COVID-19 has made it 
clearer than ever that it is time to step out of the footprint of our institutions, and to 
recognize that the need to find upstream opportunities to prevent downstream tragedies. 
KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 will exacerbate disparities in perinatal outcomes.. · The virus, 
per se, is not the pandemic's biggest threat to the health of minority women.. · The solution 
to maternal mortality cannot be found within the walls of hospitals..

26. Securing systems leadership by local government through health and wellbeing 
strategies. 
Learmonth Alyson M. Journal of public health (Oxford, England) 2018;40(3):467-475.  

BackgroundThe aim of this study was to strengthen Health and Wellbeing Strategies 
(HWSs) by identifying potential areas for system leadership across local authorities in 
relation to specific aspects of health/illness, wider determinants of health and 
transformational change management.MethodThe work involved a document analysis of 
strengths of the first 12 HWSs produced in the North East of England applying principles of 
appreciative inquiry (AI), followed by a knowledge-to-action group approach with 
stakeholders. A summative event resulted in Health and Wellbeing Board (HWB) members 
identifying potential areas for collaboration.ResultsThe study identified diverse examples of 
good practice, and considerable consensus in terms of key priorities, both wider 
determinants such as employment, transport and housing, and subject areas such as 
lifestyle issues and children having the best start in life. There was agreement in principle to 
work across local authority boundaries, with academic partners. Consideration of HWSs as 
part of a complex adaptive system was welcomed by HWB 
Members.ConclusionsCollaborative working across HWBs could strengthen the 
effectiveness of HWSs in relation to inequalities in health, place-shaping and wider 
determinants of wellbeing. The co-production of identified areas to work toward health 
improvement was successful.

27. Can inequality be tamed through boundary work? A qualitative study of health 
promotion aimed at reducing health inequalities. 
Pedersen Pia Vivian Social science & medicine (1982) 2017;185:1-8.  

This paper examines the organisational dynamics that arise in health promotion aimed at 
reducing health inequalities. The paper draws on ethnographic fieldwork among public 
health officers in Danish municipalities and qualitative interviews from an evaluation of 
health promotion programmes targeting homeless and other marginalised citizens. 
Analytically, we focus on 'boundary work', i.e. the ways in which social and symbolic 
boundaries are established, maintained, transgressed and negotiated, both at the

administrative level and among frontline professionals. The paper discusses three types of 
boundary work: (i) demarcating professional domains; (ii) setting the boundaries of the task 
itself; and (iii) managing administrative boundaries. The main argument is that the 
production, maintenance and transgression of these three types of boundaries constitute 
central and time-consuming aspects of the practices of public health professionals, and that 
boundary work constitutes an important element in professional practices seeking to 'tame 
a wicked problem', such as social inequalities in health. A cross-cutting feature of the three 
types of boundary work is the management of the divide between health and social issues, 
which the professionals seemingly seek to uphold and transgress at the same time. The 
paper thus contributes to ongoing discussions of intersectoral action to address health 
inequalities. Furthermore, it extends the scope and application of the concept of boundary 
work in the sociology of public health by suggesting that the focus in previous research on 
professional demarcation be broadened in order to capture other types of boundaries that 
shape, and are shaped by, professional practices. 

   

28. Health and wellbeing boards: public health decision making bodies or political 
pawns? 
Greaves Z. Public health 2017;143:78-84.  

OBJECTIVESHealth and Wellbeing boards in England are uniquely constituted; embedded 
in the local authorities with membership drawn from a range of stakeholders and partner 
organizations. This raises the question of how decision making functions of the boards 
reflects wider public health decision making, if criteria are applied to decision making, and 
what prioritization processes, if any, are used.METHODSQualitative research methods 
were employed and five local boards were approached, interview dyads were conducted 
with the boards Chair and Director of Public Health across four of these (n = 4). Three 
questions were addressed: how are decisions made? What are the criteria applied to 
decision making? And how are criteria then prioritized? A thematic approach was used to 
analyse data identifying codes and extracting key themes.RESULTSEquity, effectiveness 
and consistency with strategies of board and partners were most consistently identified by 
participants as criteria influencing decisions. Prioritization was described as an engaged 
and collaborative process, but criteria were not explicitly referenced in the decision making 
of the boards which instead made unstructured prioritization of population sub-groups or 
interventions agreed by consensus.CONCLUSIONSCriteria identified are broadly 
consistent with those used in wider public health practice but additionally incorporated 
criteria which recognizes the political siting of the boards. The study explored the variety in 
different board's approaches to prioritization and identified a lack of clarity and rigour in the 
identification and use of criteria in prioritization processes. Decision making may benefit 
from the explicit inclusion of criteria in the prioritization process.

outcomes. The predominant concerns of participants were 'wicked problems' in four areas: 
managing the environment, managing the policy process, managing the self and managing 
the policy team. Participants reported that the learning set had assisted them to gain 
greater awareness of and ability to navigate their environment, developed their judgement, 
strategic and problem-solving skills, contributed to empowerment and self-efficacy, and 
assisted them in providing support for their staff and building capacity in their organisation. 
Aspects of the method that contributed to learning included engaging with problems 
experienced by other members and discussing one's own problems and strategies; and 
gaining new insight into ways of framing, analysing and responding to problems. The 
findings suggest that learning sets can be a powerful method for building policy capacity 
amongst middle-senior policy managers. [Abstract]

30. The New Public Management Theory in the British Health Care System: A Critical 
Review 
Simonet D. Administration & Society 2015;47(7):802-826.  

This article analyzes health care reforms in the United Kingdom following the introduction of 
New Public Management (NPM) theory–inspired reforms. NPM has taken root deeply in the 
United Kingdom. This article looks at its impact on health care markets on the performance 
of health care organizations and on patients. It further seeks to address whether NPM 
prevents wastage and opportunism in health care. And finally, this article seeks to confirm 
whether rationality and accountability are greater under NPM or not. This article concludes 
that NPM reforms have failed to deliver on their own goals. There have been significant 
undesirable side effects and misfits between policy announcements and NPM 
implementation. Still, NPM adoption in health care has contributed to changing the Anglo-
Saxon model of capitalism.

31. The return of public health to local government in England: changing the parameters 
of the public health prioritization debate? 
Marks L. Public health 2015;129(9):1194-1203.  

OBJECTIVESTo explore the influence of values and context in public health priority-setting 
in local government in England.STUDY DESIGNQualitative interview 
study.METHODSDecision-makers' views were identified through semi-structured interviews 
and prioritization tools relevant for public health were reviewed. Interviews (29) were carried 
out with Health and Wellbeing Board members and other key stakeholders across three 
local authorities in England, following an introductory workshop.RESULTSThere were four 
main influences on priorities for public health investment in our case study sites: an 
organizational context where health was less likely to be associated with health care and 
where accountability was to a local electorate; a commissioning and priority-setting context 
(plan, do, study, act) located within broader local authority priority-setting processes; 
different views of what counts as evidence and, in particular, the role of local knowledge; 
and debates over what constitutes a public health intervention, triggered by the transfer of a 
public health budget from the NHS to local authorities in England.CONCLUSIONSThe 
relocation of public health into local authorities exposes questions over prioritizing public

32. Commissioning health and wellbeing.Commissioning health + wellbeing 
Heginbotham Chris. 2014;:No page numbers.  

This book aims to help commissioners achieve their aims for public, mental and physical 
health through their commissioning strategies. Its publication in 2014 coincides with major 
changes in commissioning arrangements and the establishment of Health and Wellbeing 
Boards (HWBs) and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). The book begins by looking 
at mental wellbeing and the different factors - cultural, social, environmental, community 
and economic - that play a part in determining individual wellbeing. Chapter Two 
concentrates in particular on the relationship between income inequalities and wellbeing 
and how values relating to equity and social justice influence the commissioning process. 
The economic advantages of commissioning for health and wellbeing are discussed. The 
book goes on to discuss equity in more detail, including mechanisms to reduce the impact 
of inequality and the global challenges to wellbeing, such as climate change. The next two 
chapters discuss the role of the commissioner and how to engage citizens in 
commissioning for health and wellbeing. The authors then examine particular social groups 
and meeting their needs through commissioning. These groups include children and young 
people, unemployed adults and people at risk of social isolation. Another chapter considers 
the relationship between depression, dementia and diabetes, arguing that commissioners 
have done very little to make the links between these three conditions explicit. The final 
chapters look at effective implementation and economic evaluation of commissioned 
programmes and interventions. An appendix contains a list of useful resources for 
commissioners. Cites numerous references. 

   

33. Exploring how health and wellbeing boards are tackling health inequalities with 
particular reference to the role of environmental health 
Dhesi Surindar Kishen 2014;:No page numbers.  

Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) are new local government (LG) sub-committees 
tasked with assessing local health and social care needs, and developing strategies for 
promoting integration and tackling health inequalities; yet they have no statutory authority to 
compel action. This research explored how they approached tackling health inequalities, 
focussing on the role of environmental health (EH), the LG public health occupation, in the 
pre-shadow and shadow stages and as they went live in April 2013. Four case study sites 
(based around individual HWBs) were purposively sampled to ensure that a variety of 
HWBs were included, including unitary and two-tier authorities and urban, suburban and 
rural areas. Data collection at each case study site included semi-structured interviews, 
observation of HWB meetings, and documentary analysis and extended for 18 months from 
early 2012. In addition, EH practitioners and managers were interviewed from each of the 
English regions to provide a wider context. The data was analysed thematically both

inductively and deductively using Atlas.ti. and conclusions drawn. HWBs were varied in 
their structures, practices and intentions and some changed considerably during the 
research, as would be expected at a time of new policy development and implementation. 
There was evident commitment and enthusiasm from HWB members to improve the health 
of local populations. However it is unclear what 'success' will be or how it will be measured 
and attributed to the work of the HWB, and there were some tensions between the various 
parties involved. There was an espoused commitment to the principles of Marmot, in 
particular to children, however much of the focus during HWB meetings was on integrating 
health and social care. Taking action on many of the social determinants of health is 
outside the core sphere of HWB control, however they did not generally appear to be 
utilising some of the readily available tools, such as EH work to improve local living and 
working conditions. EH was found to be largely 'invisible' within its own public health 
community and does not have a tradition of evidence based practice needed to secure 
funding in the new system. This, along with the decline of the regulatory role, has led to a 
period of reflection and adaptation. The research findings are linked by the policy 
approaches of 'doodle' and localism, including the shrinking of the state, and in particular 
the retreat of statutory and regulatory roles and the introduction of overt political values in 
policy making; shifting the focus to relationships, partnership-building, integration and the 
impact of individuals. The contexts in which the research has taken place, both at local and 
national levels, including financial austerity, major health restructuring, and high national 
and local expectations are all significant factors which have shaped the findings. [Abstract]

PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to consider the effectiveness of partnership 
working in public health and draws on a systematic review of public health partnerships and 
original research conducted by the authors. It then considers in the light of research 
evidence whether the recently established Health and Wellbeing Boards (HWBs) under the 
2012 Health and Social Care Act will help agencies to work together more effectively to 
improve population health or will go the way of previous initiatives and fall short of their 
original promise. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The paper is based on a

systematic literature review conducted by the authors and empirical research focusing upon 
the ability of public health partnerships to reduce health inequalities and improve population 
health outcomes. It also draws on recent studies evaluating HWBs. FINDINGS: The paper 
finds that, hitherto, public health partnerships have had limited impact on improving 
population health and reducing health inequalities and that there is a danger that HWBs will 
follow the same path-dependent manner of previous partnership initiatives with limited 
impact in improving population health outcomes and reducing health inequalities. 
RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The research draws on a systematic literature 
review and further scoping review of public health partnerships, in addition to empirical 
research conducted by the authors. It also reviews the current evidence base on HWBs. It 
is recognised that HWBs are in their early stages and have not as yet had the time to fulfil 
their role in service collaboration and integration. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The paper 
gives an overview of how and why public health partnerships in the past have not lived up 
to the expectations placed upon them. It then offers practical steps that HWBs need to take 
to take to ensure the mistakes of the past are not replicated in the future. SOCIAL 
IMPLICATIONS: The research outlines how public health partnerships can operate in a 
more effective manner, to ensure a more seamless provision for service users. The paper 
then gives pointers as to how this can benefit HWBs and the wider community they serve. 
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper draws on a comprehensive research study of the 
effectiveness of public health partnerships on improving health outcomes and a systematic 
literature review. In addition, it also draws upon the current evidence base evaluating 
HWBs, to inform the discussion on their future prospects, in regard to partnership working 
in public health and promoting service integration. Keywords Public health, Partnership

37. The political origins of health inequity : prospects for change. 
Ottersen Ole Petter. Lancet, 2014;:No page numbers.  

Global governance processes outside the health sector must address the root causes of 
global health inequalities, according to the Commission on Global Governance for Health. 
The concept of global governance for health is explained, highlighting the current power 
disparities. The report considers a number of policy areas which affect health but which 
require improved global governance, including economic crises, intellectual property and 
knowledge, foreign investment treaties, food security, transnational business activity, 
irregular migration and violent conflict. Dysfunctions of the global governance system are 
identified as the imbalance of representation in decision-making processes, weak 
accountability procedures, a reluctance to adapt to changing needs, insufficient policy 
space for health and a lack of international institutions in certain policy areas. The 
Commission proposes a UN Multistakeholder Platform on Global Governance for Health 
and an Independent Scientific Monitoring Panel on Global Social and Political Determinants 
of Health and suggests other measures for immediate action. Cites 267 references.

38. Governing local partnerships : does external steering help local agencies address 
wicked problems?. 
Martin Steve. Policy & Politics, 2013;:No page numbers.  

Partnerships have played an increasingly prominent role in local governance and there has 
been considerable debate about the impact which self-organising capacity and government 
intervention have on their effectiveness. This paper examines what kinds of self-steering 
local public service partnerships require in order to address intractable public policy 
problems, and whether external steering by government helps or hinders them. It concludes 
that 'soft steering' by government can be instrumental in establishing and mobilising 
partnerships. The type of self-steering they deploy depends on the context in which they 
operate and the kinds of collaborative activities they attempt. Cites numerous references.

We remind readers of the evidence that community empowerment is a cost-effective way to 
improve health, and also that the conditions now exist to develop this approach in the UK, 
by facilitating collaboration between clusters of general practices and multiple other 
organisations. We argue that it is the role of Health and Wellbeing Boards to make sure that 
this huge potential is realised.

44. Prospects for progress on health inequalities in England in the post-primary care 
trust era: professional views on challenges, risks and opportunities. 
Turner Daniel BMC public health 2013;13:274.  

BACKGROUNDAddressing health inequalities remains a prominent policy objective of the 
current UK government, but current NHS reforms involve a significant shift in roles and 
responsibilities. Clinicians are now placed at the heart of healthcare commissioning through 
which significant inequalities in access, uptake and impact of healthcare services must be 
addressed. Questions arise as to whether these new arrangements will help or hinder 
progress on health inequalities. This paper explores the perspectives of experienced 
healthcare professionals working within the commissioning arena; many of whom are likely 
to remain key actors in this unfolding scenario.METHODSSemi-structured interviews were 
conducted with 42 professionals involved with health and social care commissioning at 
national and local levels. These included representatives from the Department of Health, 
Primary Care Trusts, Strategic Health Authorities, Local Authorities, and third sector 
organisations.RESULTSIn general, respondents lamented the lack of progress on health 
inequalities during the PCT commissioning era, where strong policy had not resulted in 
measurable improvements. However, there was concern that GP-led commissioning will 
fare little better, particularly in a time of reduced spending. Specific concerns centred on: 
reduced commitment to a health inequalities agenda; inadequate skills and loss of 
expertise; and weakened partnership working and engagement. There were more mixed 
opinions as to whether GP commissioners would be better able than their predecessors to 
challenge large provider trusts and shift spend towards prevention and early intervention,

and whether GPs' clinical experience would support commissioning action on inequalities. 
Though largely pessimistic, respondents highlighted some opportunities, including the 
potential for greater accountability of healthcare commissioners to the public and more 
influential needs assessments via emergent Health & Wellbeing 
Boards.CONCLUSIONSThere is doubt about the ability of GP commissioners to take 
clearer action on health inequalities than PCTs have historically achieved. Key actors 
expect the contribution from commissioning to address health inequalities to become even 
more piecemeal in the new arrangements, as it will be dependent upon the interest and 
agency of particular individuals within the new commissioning groups to engage and 
influence a wider range of stakeholders.

45. Public health and health and wellbeing boards: antecedents, theory and 
development. 
Murphy Peter Perspectives in public health 2013;133(5):248-253.  

The 2012 Health and Social Care Act transfers responsibility for public health in England 
from primary care trusts to local authorities. This article traces the theoretical and policy 
antecedents of the proposals and highlights some key changes since their original 
conception in the 2010 public health white paper. It suggests that the development of health 
and well-being boards and their objectives can best be understood by viewing them through 
the theoretical prism of public value or new public service theory and concludes with some 
recommendations for their implementation and development.

2009;31(3):453–456.  

The need for better evidence continues to be emphasized by both researchers and users of 
research. ‘Better evidence for a better world’ was the theme of this year's Campbell 
Colloquium for example, a gathering of researchers and policy-makers who aim to 
systematically build the evidence on the effectiveness of social policies and programs, 
including those aimed at improving social welfare, reducing crime and improving 
educational outcomes.

Reviewer’s Note: Medline strategy - suggest use of a search string from the bank for the COVID facet of the search topic in Medline (including subject headngs!). Useful results on found on this very specific topic, with results from a range of sources. Complementary to other BAME + COVID searches already present as this is focused on health and wellbeing boards.�
