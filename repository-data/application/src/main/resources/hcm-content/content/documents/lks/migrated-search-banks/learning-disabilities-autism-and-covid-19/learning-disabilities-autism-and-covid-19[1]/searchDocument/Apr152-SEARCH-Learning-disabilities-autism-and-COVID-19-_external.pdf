 “We need to run a search amongst recent / contemporary health publications to 
establish what exists around the impact of Covid 19 on people with Learning 
Disabilities or Autism or both […] Anecdotally there is significant impact as 
people with Learning Disabilities are disproportionately affected by health

There have been several recent reports and articles published exploring the impact of the pandemic on 

people with learning disabilities (LD), autism, or both. The results are organised into reports [1-5] 

guidance [6-24] items that have appeared in the news on this topic [24-27] and journal articles from the 

UK [28-41] and those from outside the UK. [42-71]. A Joint Select Committee report was published on 

the 12th June 2020 which looked at “Human Rights and the Government’s response to COVID-19: the 

detention of young people who are autistic and/ or have learning disabilities. ” The report found that “the 

coronavirus crisis had resulted in human rights abuses and that young people’s rights are at risk through 

unlawful blanket bans on visits, the suspension of routine inspections, increased use of restraint  and 

solitary confinement, and the vulnerability of those in detention to infection with COVID-19”. [1] A 

Parliament UK Insight briefing, published on the 9th June 2020, looks at evidence of the impact of 

coronavirus on people with a learning disability in England and asks questions such as “what does the 

data show?” and “can people with a learning disability access testing?” – they warn that this is a fast 

moving issue and that the information should be read as correct from the 3 rd July 2020. [2] In June 2020 

the CQC published data on deaths of people living with a learning disability – data showed between 10 

April and 15 May 2020, “386 people with a learning disability, some of whom may also be autistic, died 

who were receiving care from services which provide support for people with a learning disability and/or 

autism” – “this is a 134% increase in the number of death notifications this year.” [3] Researchers from 

University College London wanted to look at the impact of the Coronavirus Act and the lockdown impact 

on families of autistic children and young people – they did this by conducting a survey between the 1st 

and 30th April 2020 with 449 participants - one statistical f inding was that 86% of family carers think that 

the needs of autistic people and their families have not been adequately addressed during COVID-19. [4] 

Inclusion London published a report in June 2020 highlighting the effects of discrimination and inequality 

on disabled people during the pandemic – it includes a couple of examples relating to learning 

disabilities. [5] I would also recommend looking at the papers published from the UK relating to this 

subject. [28-41]  Particularly in terms of workforce the new challenges presented for LD nurses [39], the 

experience of the pandemic in a UK LD service [36] and the impact of LD nursing services in Scotland 

[33]. A full list of the results retrieved is available in the table below.

detention facilities highly vulnerable 
to Human Rights abuses 

 
12th June 2020, Joint Select 
Committee 
 

Today the Joint Committee on Human Rights have published their Report, 
"Human Rights and the Government's response to COVID-19: the detention of 
young people who are autistic and/or have learning disabilities", which finds 

that the coronavirus crisis has resulted in human rights abuses. Young people's 
rights are at risk through unlawful blanket bans on visits, the suspension of 
routine inspections, increased use of restraint and solitary confinement, and the 
vulnerability of those in detention to infection with Covid-19.

2 Coronavirus: people with learning 
disabilities  
 

9th June 2020, Parliament UK 
 
 

New data shows a significant increase in deaths of people with a learning 
disability as a result of Covid-19.  Until 5 June 2020, the Government’s criteria 
for care home testing excluded those for people with a learning disability. 

The Coronavirus Act 2020 has also relaxed local authority duties for care and 
support needs assessments. The charity Mencap concluded that during the 
coronavirus outbreak, “people with a learning disability continue to be 
forgotten.”  This Insight looks at evidence of the impact of coronavirus on 

people with a learning disability in England.

Statistics (ONS) reporting on deaths. The ONS data is not broken down by 
whether the person who died had a disability. 

Supported by ONS we have completed a targeted piece of analysis to better 
understand the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on people with a learning 

disability, some of whom may also be autistic, and how the number of deaths 
during this period compares to the number of deaths last year. […]  

This data shows that between 10 April and 15 May this year, 386 people with a 
learning disability, some of whom may also be autistic, died who were receiving 
care from services which provide support for people with a learning disability 
and/or autism. For the same period last year 165 people with a learning 

disability, some of whom may also be autistic, died who were receiving care 
from services which provide support for people with a learning disability and/or 
autism. This is a 134% increase in the number of death notifications this year. 
This new data should be considered when decisions are being made about the 

prioritisation of testing at a national and local level.

4 Impact of Covid-19 on the 
experiences of parents and family 
carers of autistics children and young 
people in the UK  

 
2020, UCL Research Briefing 
 

The outbreak of Covid-19 has triggered profound changes to the lives of 
parents and carers of autistic children and young people (CYP), including 
school closures for most, restricted access to services and family support due 
to social distancing measures and changes to home routines. The Coronavirus 

Act (2020), no doubt necessarily rushed through parliament with scrutiny-
defying haste, has reduced the rights of disabled people and their families to 
care, support and educational provision. These rights are hard won at the best 
of times 

 
Key statistical findings: 

•86% of family carers think that the needs of autistic people and their families 

have not been adequately addressed during Covid-19

•46% of family carers stated that they consider their autistic children or 
themselves to be at higher risk for Covid-19 than the general population. 

•70% of family carers report that their daily routines have changed. Importantly, 
many participants did not want to return to the pre-Covid world. 

•58% of family carers still had access to at least one type of specialist support.

5 Abandoned, forgotten and ignored – 
the impact of COVID-19 on Disabled 
people 

 
24th June 2020, Inclusion London 
 

The report paints a stark picture. From the outset, Disabled people have been 
discriminated against, forgotten, and in some cases abandoned as 
policymakers have ignored our needs. Or, at best considered us as an 

afterthought.  During the pandemic  Disabled people saw our legal rights 
diminished, we experienced resource rationing and blanket policies.  This led to 
many of us struggling to get bare necessities, losing support and independence 
and living in fear for our lives. The pandemic has shone a light on the long-

standing structural inequalities and discrimination that Deaf and Disabled 
people experience. The dreadful disparities are reflected in the grim data 
released by the Office for National Statistics, which says Disabled people were 
about twice as likely to die from Covid-19. Despite the shocking statistics, the 

plight of Disabled people was largely missing from public discourse. We are 
publishing this report to give voice to people who shared their experience with 
us. 

For examples specific to learning disabilities see p. 11 and p. 20 

“There appears to be insufficient delivery slots from major supermarkets 
necessitating my husband going out to shop. My son who is learning disabled 
(with an additional kidney condition) and I (physically disabled) stay home.” 

“I have a learning disability with a mild stammer speaking on the phone is 
difficult for me. I can't go out to see face to face and it's hard.”

7 NICE updates rapid COVID-19 

guideline on critical care  
 
25th March 2020, NICE 
 

We have listened to concerns raised by patient groups about the application of 

our rapid COVID-19 critical care guideline […] Patient groups and 
representatives were concerned that applying the score to people with learning 
disabilities, autism and other stable long-term disabilities, would put them at a 
disadvantage when decisions were made about admission to critical care in this 

time of intense pressure. The NHS Specialist Clinical Frailty Network has since 
updated their advice on using the CFS, stating that it should not be used in 
isolation to direct clinical decision making and that clinicians should take any 
decisions about care in conjunction with patients and their carers where 

possible. The new advice also includes a clarification that the tool should not be 
used in certain groups, including those with learning disabilities or with stable 
long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy.

10 Guidance for the Treatment and 
Management of COVID-19 Among 

People with Intellectual Disabilities 

 

2020, Journal of Policy and Practice 
in Intellectual Disabilities  

 

The current COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing world crisis and people with 
intellectual disabilities (IDs) are vulnerable due to disparity in healthcare 

provision and physical and mental health multimorbidity. While most people will 
develop mild symptoms upon contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), some will develop serious complications. The 
aim of this study is to present guidelines for the care and treatment of people 

with IDs during the COVID-19 pandemic for both community teams providing 
care to people with IDs and inpatient psychiatric settings. The guidelines cover 
specific issues associated with hospital passports, individual COVID-19 care 
plans, the important role of families and carers, capacity to make decisions, 

issues associated with social distancing, ceiling of care/treatment escalation 
plans, mental health and challenging behavior, and caring for someone 
suspected of contracting or who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 within community 
or inpatient psychiatric settings. We have proposed that the included conditions 

recommended by Public Health England to categorize someone as high risk of 
severe illness due to COVID-19 should also include mental health and 
challenging behavior. There are specific issues associated with providing care 
to people with IDs and appropriate action must be taken by care providers to 

ensure that disparity of healthcare is addressed during the COVID-19 
pandemic. We recognize that our guidance is focused upon healthcare delivery 
in England and invite others to augment our guidance for use in other 
jurisdictions.

23 Handle the Autism Spectrum 
Condition During Coronavirus 

(COVID-19) Stay At Home period: 
Ten Tips for Helping Parents and 
Caregivers of Young Children 

 

April 2020, Brain Sciences  

COVID-19 has become pandemic [1] and many government decrees have 
declared restrictive measures in order to prevent its wider spread. For parents 

and children, staying at home is one of these measures. In this situation the 
handling of young children with special needs such as autism spectrum 
condition (ASC) could be challenging for families and caregivers. Usually these 
children have interventions for several hours a week at home with special 

therapists or in dedicated hospitals and institutes. However at the moment, due 
to contagion containment measures, both the families and the ASC children are 
not physically supported by their therapists and they cannot attend the outside 
interventions. These measures, necessary for the health of all of us, need to be 

carefully handled to avoid an increase in parental stress and an exacerbation of 
children’s behavioral problems. ASC is a severe multifactorial disorder 
characterized by an umbrella of specific peculiarities in the areas of the social 
communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviours [2]. The 

incidence of ASC is worldwide and recent epidemiological data estimated it to 
be higher than 1/100 [3,4]. The main aim of this editorial is to give some advice, 
summarized in 10 tips, to help families to handle children with ASC during this 
period.

In this Current Issues article, I will use National Health Service guidelines on 
hand hygiene and social distancing measures (which the UK government 

introduced in March, 2020, to combat the COVID-19 coronavirus) to give 
readers an insight into the restricted social life of an autistic person, using 
auto/biography to explore my personal experience of social isolation and being 
a 'vulnerable adult'. I am an Autistic, newly qualified sociologist and I will be 

using my positionality as a vantage point, as the public adjust to my 'normal'. I 
acknowledge the element of 'choice' in autistic individuals' self-isolation but 
focus here on the social restrictions imposed on us from outside (social 
isolation). I call for social change, once the social distancing measures are 

lifted. These changes might occur at the individual level (e.g. being a friend) but 
will still broaden our social world.

In the light of the Corona Virus pandemic which prematurely killed an unknown 
number of disabled people, the main purpose of this Current Issue paper is to 

raise questions about how historians can investigate the subject of premature 
death given the fact that any records which name individual patients are closed

sleep and associated 

psychopathology during the COVID-

July 2020, Journal of child 

psychology and psychiatry, and 
allied disciplines 

It is anticipated that the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
and associated societal response will have wide-ranging impacts on youth 
development and mental health. Sleep is crucial for child and adolescent health 

and well-being, and the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen 
during and following the pandemic is high. This may be particularly true for 
children and adolescents who are at heightened risk for the onset of sleep and 
mental health disturbances and for those whom developmental changes 

impacting sleep are rapidly occurring. Youth with preexisting 
psychopathologies (including anxiety and depression) and 
neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and autism spectrum disorder) could be especially vulnerable to 

disturbed sleep during this period of change and uncertainty. It is thus 
imperative that sleep considerations be part of research and clinical initiatives 
aimed at understanding and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 
children and adolescents. This article considers ways in which the pandemic 

may impact sleep, including research and clinical implications.

shifted to online school and increased use of remote delivery of healthcare and 

autism supports. Access to these services needs to be increased to mitigate 
the negative impact of COVID-19 and future epidemics/pandemics. The rapid 
expansion in the use of telehealth platforms can have a positive impact on both 
care and research. It can help to address key priorities for the autism 

communities including long waitlists for assessment and care, access to 
services in remote locations, and restricted hours of service. However, system-
level changes are urgently needed to ensure equitable access and flexible care 
models, especially for families and individuals who are socioeconomically 

disadvantaged. COVID-19 mandates the use of technology to support a 
broader range of care options and better meet the diverse needs of autistic 
people and their families. It behooves us to use this crisis as an opportunity to 
foster resilience not only for a given individual or their family, but also the 

system: to drive enduring and autism-friendly changes in healthcare, social 
systems, and the broader socio-ecological contexts.

The impact on acute NHS services and care homes has been well documented 
and at the forefront of media attention. Learning disability services have 
responded to the COVID19 pandemic however to date there has been limited 
consideration on how this is affecting individual lives. This has been considered 

and explored by one board area in Scotland. For Community Teams, there has 
been disruption to service delivery. With routine, face‐to‐face contact cancelled 
and assessed on an individual basis. Staff responded by ensuring ongoing 

telephone contact, directly with clients, family members, carers and support 

staff. Additional assessments have been devised to record COVID‐19 data 
completed during contact, including recording the presence of symptoms, 
positive diagnosis, self‐isolation and where individuals are shielding.

35 COVID-19 and people with 
intellectual disability: impacts of a 

pandemic 
 
May 2020, Irish journal of 
psychological medicine  

 

The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic affect all groups in society. People with 
intellectual disability (ID) are especially vulnerable to the physical, mental and 

social effects of the pandemic. Cognitive impairments can limit understanding of 
information to protect them relying on carers to be vigilant on their behalf during 
quarantine. Restrictions on usual activities are likely to induce mental stress 
especially among those who are autistic leading to an escalation in challenging 

behaviours, risk of placement breakdown and increased the use of 
psychotropic medication. People with ID are vulnerable to exploitation by others 
where the usual community supports no longer function to protect them. In 
future pandemics, it is important that lessons are learned from the impacts 

COVID-19 have on people with ID. Collecting the evidence through a rigorous 
approach should help to empower people with ID and their carers to face future 
outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Background. The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in children remains low 
to date. In just a few months, COVID-19 has affected millions of people 
worldwide, and as of the date of this publication, the pandemic continues. 
Based on the current available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher 

risk of contracting COVID-19 than adults. However, children with neurological 
and neuromuscular conditions are vulnerable to the respiratory complications of 
other viral infections. Objectives. To assess whether children with brain-based 
developmental disabilities were more likely to develop COVID-19 and have 

complications or poorer outcomes following infection. Methods. We conducted 
a two-week rapid review on studies with primary data regarding children aged 
between zero and 18 years old with brain-based developmental disabilities, or 
who were at risk of developing such disabilities, with confirmed or suspected

38 Should Autism Spectrum Conditions 
Be Characterised in a More Positive 

Way in Our Modern World? 

 
May 2020, Medicina  
 

In a special issue that focuses on complex presentations related to Autism, we 
ask the question in this editorial whether an Autism Spectrum Condition without 

complexity is a disorder, or whether it represents human diversity? Much 
research into Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) over the years has focused 
on comparisons between neuro-typical people and people with Autism 
Spectrum Conditions. These comparisons have tended to draw attention to 

'deficits' in cognitive abilities and descriptions of behaviours that are 
characterised as unwanted. Not surprisingly, this is reflected in the classification 
systems from the World Health Organisation and the American Psychiatric 
Association. Public opinion about ASC may be influenced by presentations in 

the media of those with ASC who also have intellectual disability. Given that 
diagnostic systems are intended to help us better understand conditions in 
order to seek improved outcomes, we propose a more constructive approach to 
descriptions that uses more positive language, and balances descriptions of 

deficits with research finding of strengths and differences. We propose that this 
will be more helpful to individuals on the Autism Spectrum, both in terms of 
individual self-view, but also in terms of how society views Autism Spectrum 
Conditions more positively. Commentary has also been made on guidance that 

has been adjusted for people with ASC in relation to the current COVID-19 
pandemic.

Social, economic, and health consequences are inevitable.Box 1 Social 
distancing measures Advising the whole population to self-isolate at home if 
they or their family have symptoms Bans on social gatherings (including mass 

gatherings) Stopping flights and public transport Closure of "non-essential"

The health benefits of social distancing measures are obvious, with a slower 
spread of infection reducing the risk that health services will be overwhelmed.

A state's real commitment to its international human rights obligations is never 

more challenged than when it faces emergency situations. Addressing actual 
and potential resourcing pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has 
resulted in, amongst other things, modifications to Scottish mental health and 
capacity law and the issuing of new guidance relating to associated practice. 

Whether these emergency or ordinary measures are invoked during the crisis 
there are potential implications for the rights of persons with mental illness, 
learning disability and dementia notably those relating to individual autonomy 
and dignity. This article will consider areas of particular concern but how strict 

adherence to the legal, ethical and human rights framework in Scotland will 
help to reduce the risk of adverse consequences.

nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We 
were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different 
topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, 

maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics. Conclusion: The CORD-19 open 
research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 
disease but also ID and the relationship between them. We suggest 
researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 

and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields

43 Effective Strategies for Managing 
COVID-19 Emergency Restrictions 
for Adults with Severe ASD in a 
Daycare Center in Italy 

 

July 2020, Brain Sciences 

 

 

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a serious challenge for the life and mental 
health of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). COVID-19 sanitary 
restrictions led to significant changes in the lives of people with ASD, including 
their routines; similarly, these modifications affected the daily activities of the 

daycare centers which they attended. The present retrospective study 
evaluated the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on challenging behaviors in a 
cohort of people with severe ASD attending a daycare center in Italy at the 
beginning of the pandemic. During the first two weeks of the pandemic, we did 

not observe variations in challenging behaviors. This suggests that adaptations 
used to support these individuals with ASD in adapting to the COVID-19 
emergency restrictions were effective for managing their behavior.

Dear Editor, I would like to share ideas on “The challenges of dental care 
provision in patients with learning disabilities and special requirements during 
COVID-19 pandemic.”1Indeed, there are many changes of dental practice and 

patient care during COVID-19 pandemic.1Only necessary and emergency 
dental procedures are performed. Regarding the specific group of patients who 
require dental care, special management might be necessary. For the patients 
with learning disabilities, a poor collaboration is expected and the prevention for 

COVID-19 during dental practice might be very difficult. The avoidance of 
dental procedures for those patients might be the ideas by some practitioners 
but it is necessary to have a good adjustment aiming at the best advantages for 
the patients.2During COVID-19outbreak, it is questionable whether we should 

postpone all procedures for those patients or not. In fact, dentist has to follow 
standard infection control principles for all practices regardless of COVID-19 
outbreak or not.

To the editor The worldwide spread and the high virulence of COVID-19 led to 
a pandemic since March 2020, as it has been affecting 216 countries until the 

end of May 2020, wherein these numbers increase daily. This unprecedented 
situation has resulted in a significant impact on health and dental care, in both 
private and public sectors,1affecting the hospital and community-based special 
care dentistry (SCD) ser-vices around the world. The worldwide spread of novel 

coronavirus COVID-19 disease with high virulence rate had caused an 
unprecedented impact on specialist dental services, including dental sedation 
and treatment under general anesthesia. COVID-19 mass consequences 
halted not only routine dental care but also considerably interrupted routine 

care and dental general anesthesia (DGA)on global scale.2What is more, the 
compulsory implementation of advanced personal protective equipment

51 Mortality of people with intellectual 

disabilities during the 2017/2018 
influenza epidemic in the 
Netherlands: potential implications 
for the COVID-19 pandemic 

 

July 2020, Journal of Intellectual 
Disability Research 

 

Background: Data on the development of Covid-19 among people with 

intellectual disabilities (IDs) are scarce and it is uncertain to what extent general 
population data applies to people with ID. To give an indication of possible 
implications, this study investigated excess mortality patterns during a previous 
influenza epidemic. Methods: Using Dutch population and mortality registers, a 

historical cohort study was designed to compare mortality during the 2017–
2018 influenza epidemic with mortality in the same period in the three previous 
years. People with ID were identified by entitlements to residential ID-care 
services as retrieved from a national database. Results: Data covered the 

entire adult Dutch population (12.6 million; GenPop), of which 91 064 
individuals were identified with an ID. During the influenza epidemic, mortality 
among people with ID increased almost three times as much than in the 
GenPop (15.2% vs. 5.4%), and more among male individuals with ID (+19.5%) 

than among female individuals with ID (+10.6%), as compared with baseline. In 
both cohorts, comparable increases in mortality within older age groups and 
due to respiratory causes were seen. Particularly in the ID-cohort, excess 
deaths also occurred in younger age groups, due to endocrine diseases and 

ID-specific causes. Conclusions: During the 2017–2018 influenza epidemic, 
excess mortality among people with ID was three times higher than in the 
general Dutch population, appeared more often at young age and with a 
broader range of underlying causes. These findings suggest that a pandemic 

may disproportionally affect people with ID while population data may not 
immediately raise warnings. Early detection of diverging patterns and faster 
implementation of tailored strategies therefore require collection of good quality 
data.

(IDD). The aim of this study is to describe how individuals with IDD have been 
affected in the first 100 days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Shortly after 

the first COVID-19 case was reported in the USA, our organisation, which 
provides continuous support for over 11 000 individuals with IDD, assembled 
an outbreak committee composed of senior leaders from across the health care 
organisation. The committee led the development and deployment of a 

comprehensive COVID-19 prevention and suppression strategy, utilising 
current evidence-based practice, while surveilling the global and local situation 
daily. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across 2400 
homes, which were communicated to our employees using multi-faceted 

channels including an electronic resource library, mobile and web applications, 
paper postings in locations, live webinars and direct mail. Using custom-built 
software applications enabling us to track patient, client and employee cases 
and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify 

cases and to suppress transmission, which included the use of personal 
protective equipment. A COVID-19 case was defined as a positive nucleic acid 
test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: In the 100-day period between 20 January 
2020 and 30 April 2020, we provided continuous support for 11 540 individuals 

with IDD. Sixty-four per cent of the individuals were in residential, community 
settings, and 36% were in intermediate care facilities. The average age of the 
cohort was 46 ± 12 years, and 60% were male. One hundred twenty-two 
individuals with IDD were placed in quarantine for exhibiting symptoms and 

signs of acute infection such as fever or cough. Sixty-six individuals tested 
positive for SARS-CoV-2, and their average age was 50. The positive 
individuals were located in 30 different homes (1.3% of total) across 14 states. 
Fifteen homes have had single cases, and 15 have had more than one case. 

Fifteen COVID-19-positive individuals were hospitalised. As of 30 April, seven 
of the individuals hospitalised have been discharged back to home and are 
recovering. Five remain hospitalised, with three improving and two remaining in 
intensive care and on mechanical ventilation. There have been three deaths. 

We found that among COVID-19-positive individuals with IDD, a higher number 
of chronic medical conditions and male sex were characteristics associated with 
a greater likelihood of hospitalisation. Conclusions: In the first 100 days of the 
COVID-19 outbreak in the USA, we observed that people with IDD living in

congregate care settings can benefit from a coordinated approach to infection 
control, case identification and cohorting, as evidenced by the low relative case 

rate reported. Male individuals with higher numbers of chronic medical 
conditions were more likely to be hospitalised, while most younger, less 
chronically ill individuals recovered spontaneously at home.

and adolescent psychiatrist on the 
move] 

 

June 2020, L'Encephale 

COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease due to an infection with the SARS-CoV2 
virus. It has become a pandemic in early 2020. The disease appears less 
devastating in children and adolescents. However, stress, quarantine and 

eventually mourning have major impacts on development. It is difficult to 
describe what this pandemic implies for a child psychiatrist, other than by giving 
a first-hand account. I propose to go through the main ethical questions that 
have arisen; to describe how my hospital team has reorganized itself to meet 

the new demands and questions, in particular by opening a unit dedicated to 
people with autism and challenging behaviors affected by COVID-19; and to 
address, in a context of national discussion, how the discipline has sought to 
understand the conditions of a certain well-being during quarantine. Finally, I 

will try to conclude with more speculative reflections on re-opening.

54 An Essential Service Decision Model 
for ABA Providers During Crisis 

 

June 2020, Behaviour analysis in 

practice  

 

In the United States, applied behavior analysis (ABA) is broadly recognized as 
a medically necessary treatment for individuals diagnosed with autism and 
related disorders (Association of Professional Behavior Analysts, 2020, 
Guidelines for practicing applied behavior analysis during COVID-19 pandemic, 

Retrieved from

_Practicing_During_COVID-19_Pandemic_040920.pdf). We argue that this 

designation should not be called into question in light of a particular disaster 
and that it is critical to consider that an interruption of services can have long-
lasting effects on the treatment of the individual (practitioners are ethically 
obligated to uphold the continuity of services while doing no harm). This 

dilemma might be ameliorated by a decision model that considers the 
prioritization of immediate needs, the vulnerability of clients, and the 
competency of service providers. Just as the medical field prioritizes immediate 
needs during crisis situations and defers routine appointments (e.g., physicals, 

checkups), the ABA field can make similar evidence-based decisions. The

purpose of the current article is to provide a decision model for ABA 
practitioners who find themselves questioning the need for essential service 

delivery during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of this model goes 
beyond the needs of this crisis and can be applied to any emergency situation 
where services are at risk of interruption.

Online-Mediated Approach

Medicine  

 

COVID-19 is still in phase 2. The lockdown has been significantly reduced 
compared to phase 1. The centers and institutions that deal with the diagnosis 
and intervention of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require rapid 

functional adaptation to respond to patients' needs. The possibility of using 
technology to activate and manage diagnostic (preliminary diagnosis) and 
intervention processes should be explored. Two developed telemedicine 
working models for diagnosis and intervention, including synchronous and 

asynchronous transmissions, are presented. They are proposals not yet 
supported by the data. The diagnosis step is composed by two different and 
consecutives phases: (A) pre-specialistic consultation (PSC) and (B) 
specialistic assessment. The intervention step implemented well-recognized 

evidence-based models for preschoolers, school-aged, and older children in an 
online format. Parents' support is also included. The described working models 
have the purpose of carrying out preliminary specialistic answers to the families 
without aiming to replace preferable in-person assessment. Based on previous 

research findings, the telemedicine approach is accepted by parents, increases 
their sense of competence, increases the parent intervention adhesion, and 
improves the social communication competencies for children with ASD. In 
conclusion, the presented working models must be considered partial 

responses to the current emergency status and at the same time as possible 
integrations into traditional approaches.

dyspraxia, learning disabilities, epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, 
and immune system alterations. Individuals with autism can also have different 
types of behavioral challenges including deficits in social communication, 

attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, irritability, and aggression. Such

common comorbidities can present additional challenges for individuals to cope 
with during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it more difficult to receive needed 

therapies, practice physical distancing, and adjust to disrupted daily routines.

Perspectives from Around the Globe

Last year around this time, in preparation for theINSAR2019 meeting in 

Montreal, we asked members of the Autism Research editorial board as well as 
the Associate Editors to write short comments on what they considered to be 
the major gaps in autism research. The resulting Commentary was well 
received with nearly3000 downloads. The INSAR meeting scheduled for Seattle 

in 2020 was, of course, cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 
pandemic has forced the reorganization and rethinking of all science, including 
autism research. To get a sense of how autism researchers are dealing with 
this unprecedented situation around the world, we asked for short comments 

about the situation from editorial board members, Associate Editors and from 
the INSAR Global Senior Leaders in Autism Research Committee, a relatively 
new INSAR initiative chaired by Petrus de Vries (South Africa) and Declan 
Murphy (UK). We will present perspectives by World Health Organization

58 Psychosocial and Behavioral Impact 
of COVID-19 in Autism Spectrum 
Disorder: An Online Parent Survey 

 

June 2020, Brain Sciences  

The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak could result in higher 
levels of psychological distress, especially among people suffering from pre-
existing mental health conditions. Young individuals with autism spectrum 

disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable 
and complex changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the 
COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic 
sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, 

and to narratively characterize their needs. Parents and guardians of ASD 
individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating 
socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the 
COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency.

Data were available on 527 survey participants. The COVID-19 emergency 
resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in 

managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities 
(75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more 
intense and more frequent behavior problems. Behavior problems predating the 
COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 

2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 
95% CI 1.13-2.48) disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were 
receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or 
emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a 

number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support 
(47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle 
a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%). The COVID-19 outbreak has 
undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals.

COVID-19: Helping Caregivers 
Navigate the Pandemic 

 

June 2020, Annals of the Academy 

of Medicine, Singapore  

 

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted societies 

globally. As of 11 May 2020, 53 children have been infected with COVID-19 in 
Singapore (Ministry of Health, Singapore, unpublished data). Children generally 
have mild disease,1 although there is emerging literature on paediatric 
multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19. 

Less well reported is the impact of COVID-19 on the daily lives and psychology 
of children. This article highlights the implications of COVID-19 on an especially 
vulnerable population of children - children with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD). ASD is a developmental disorder characterised by impaired social 

communication, language, and restricted stereotypic behaviour with rigidities. 
ASD is prevalent. It is estimated that 50,000 individuals are affected by ASD in 
Singapore.2 Healthcare professionals are likely to encounter persons with ASD 
in their routine practice. Based on our experience in our developmental and 

behavioural paediatrics practice, caregivers experience significant challenges in 
managing children with ASD during this pandemic. Children with ASD are 
having difficulties adjusting to change and feeling anxious, whilst caregivers 
themselves are worried and fatigued. This article aims to be a resource for 

healthcare professionals in supporting these families. Strategies depicted are 
based on behavioural management principles used for ASD – promoting

Neurosciences  

 

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation is evolving rapidly, with an 

increase in the number of reported cases and countries affected world-wide. 
The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public 
health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January2020 and a 
pandemic on 11 March. Japan was the third country to register a first case of 

COVID-19 on 16 January 2020, after China and Thailand. The number of 
reported COVID-19 cases rapidly increased from the end of February 2020. 
Therefore, the Japanese government declared closing all schools from the 1st 
through 12th grades on 2 Marchand declared a PHEIC on 7 April. School and 

other education facilities’ closures substantially disrupt the usual daily life and 
add stress for children and their families. At the time of writing this paper, the 
Japanese government continues to have all schools closed and insists that 
citizens stay at home as much as possible.

June 2020, Behaviour Analysis in 
Practice  

 

Abstract In the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, U.S. 
organizations that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) programs to 
individuals with autism spectrum disorder have implemented a variety of safety 
precautions to minimize the spread of the virus, often shifting center-based 

services to the home or telehealth. Considered essential workers, ABA 
providers are exempt from government directives to close, so they have both 
the freedom and the great responsibility to make their own decisions about how 
best to keep their clients safe while continuing to provide medically necessary 

services. In the coming weeks and months, ABA providers will be faced with the 
decision about whether to reopen centers. This article does not address that 
decision, except to acknowledge the urgency to reopen, both to help clients and 
to remain solvent. Political rhetoric and contradictory public information further 

complicate this daunting decision. Because ABA providers do not have legal 
guidance to shift the burden of such decisions to local and state regulators, the 
burden is theirs alone. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic 
means that no decision is clearly wrong or right, and every decision has

many states have issued guidelines for childcare providers whose operations 

have continued throughout the pandemic. This article analyzes that guidance, 
identifies common variables potentially relevant to ABA organizations, 
highlights clinical considerations and procedural compliance, and provides ABA 
organizations with the tools to make the best decision for their clients, in their 

community, and on their timeline. 

62 A model of support for families of 

children with autism living in the 
covid-19 lockdown: Lessons from 
Italy 

 

June 2020, Behaviours Analysis in 
Practice  

 

Abstract Italy has been the European country most affected by the COVID-19 

pandemic to date and has been in social lockdown for the longest period of 
time compared to other countries outside China. Almost overnight, Italian 
behavior analysts were faced with the challenge of setting up remotely whole-
family systems aimed at maintaining adaptive skills and low levels of 

challenging behavior to be carried out solely by caregivers. Given these 
extraordinary circumstances, the protocols available from the applied behavior-
analytic, parent training, and autism literature did not appear to fully meet the 
needs of parents having to be with their children under extreme levels of stress 

in a confined space with limited reinforcers for 24 hr a day, 7 days a week. To 
meet this unprecedented challenge, we developed a dynamic and holistic 
protocol that extended to the full day and that recognized the need for 
sustainable intervention delivered solely by parents, who were often looking 

after more than one child. These practices are presented in this article, together 
with a discussion of lessons we have learned thus far, which may be useful for 
behavior analysts working in other regions in which the effects of the pandemic 
are not yet fully realized. Although somewhat unorthodox, we include some 

parent comments at the end with the goal of sharing the parent perspective in 
real time as this pandemic unfolds across the world.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts an individual’s developmental 
trajectory across several domains, supporting the importance of early detection 
and identification, which is ultimately the first step toward treatment planning. 

Children should be exposed to an ASD screening at 18 and 24 months of age, 
but such services are not always available across demographic groups or 
accessible to underserved communities. Screenings can be especially limited in 
circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other situations dictating

that people stay at home. Thus, it is important to expand the accessibility of 
assessment services that can provide accurate identification of ASD in young 

children through the use of technology such as video or mobile application 
platforms. This systematic review aimed to summarize the state of the literature 
as it relates to accessible telehealth assessments and screening tools for 
infants and toddlers suspected to have ASD in remote populations. Seven 

studies that utilized video or mobile applications to assess young children in 
underserved communities were found, including individuals within their first 3 
years of life. Although some positive results were found regarding 
effectiveness, there is a need for more sustainable research for this age group, 

especially for those with limited access to services. (PsycInfo Database Record

May 2020, Medical Hypotheses 

 

The current pandemic of Covid-19 has created a paradigm for possibly gaining 
greater insight in two conditions:Studies since the beginning of this century 
have supported the view that IGF-1 deficiency in the neonate defines the basis 

of autism. As a result, it appears that interleukin-6 in corona virus-based 
infections causes reduced defenses because of suppressed IGF-1, especially 
in older patients. This may also portend an increase of autism in the offspring of 
gravidas currently affected severely by Covid-19.

the humoral immunity due to the reduction of their proliferative response. The 

physiopathology of ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) involves several 
modifications at the genetic and at the immune level, such as the increase of 
inflammatory cytokines and abnormal immune response in several levels. We 
hypothesize that ASD could be a risk-factor as the other conditions are.

appropriate protocol for the delivery of 1:1 telehealth service (i.e., a behavior 
technician providing instruction directly to a client, with or without the assistance 
of the client's caregiver, through videoconferencing). This tool aims to help 

behavior analysts make thoughtful clinical decisions to maintain continuity of 
care for the vulnerable population with autism spectrum disorders, while 
adhering to safety measures that provide protection to society.

coronavirus outbreak 

 

May 2020, International Journal of 
Development Disabilities 

 

Considering that parents are one of the key figures in their child’s participation 

in physical activity, it is extremely important to examine parents’ perceptions 
and experiences of physical activity in order to protect children with Autism 
Spectrum Disorders (ASD) from the inactive life during the novel Coronavirus 
(COVID-19) outbreak and to include them in physical activities in the home 

environment. Although it is still a new subject, there is no research that 
addresses parents’ physical activity knowledge, needs and recommendations 
for the physical activity experiences of children with ASD during the COVID-19 
outbreak, and offers solutions accordingly. Considering this gap in the 

literature, the aim of this qualitative study is to explore parents’ perceptions on 
physical activity for their children with ASD. Participants of the study were 10 
parents with children with ASD, who participated in one-to-one semi-structured 
phone calls. Interview data were analyzed thematically. The analysis of the 

data revealed three main themes: 1) Possible benefits of physical activity 
during the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) Physical activity barriers during the COVID-
19 outbreak, and 3) Recommendations for physical activity during the COVID-
19 outbreak. The results revealed that parents thought that physical activities 

had a positive effect on the development areas of their children with ASD. It 
was determined that parents want to involve their children in physical activities 
in the home environment, but they have barriers that they need to overcome.

71 Promoting physical activity for 
children with autism spectrum

outbreak: benefits, strategies, and

2020, New York State Dental Journal 

 

Described as a global outbreak (pandemic) by the World Health Organization, 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) raises great concern with more than 2 million 
infected patients worldwide. A series of measures are taken by governments 

worldwide to prevent the spread of the outbreak. As new cases increase, 
people are asked to stay at home. Active living areas such as sports centers, 
parks and schools are closed in most countries. In this process, staying at 
home for a long time makes it difficult for individuals with special needs such as 

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) to stay physically active as well as typically 
developing individuals. The education process of children with ASD is 
disrupted, especially due to closed special education schools and rehabilitation 
centers. Online learning environments are often not suitable for children with 

ASD. It is predicted that excessive weight, obesity and sedentary life, which are 
high in children with ASD, may increase even more due to COVID-19. This 
article outlines the benefits of physical activity for children with ASD and 
provides strategies and examples of physical activity for children with ASD 

during the COVID-19 outbreak. The article is thought to be a guide for 
encouraging children with ASD in the home environment to physical activity.
