Abstract During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, testing of suspected cases in Denmark has recently been limited to those 

who were critically ill. This has left an increasing number of unregistered infections in the society, obscured 
quantification and impacted lived lives. This case story reports a possible mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 
healthy young man in his twenties. Due to strategic guidelines, he was never tested for SARS-CoV-2, but the 
medical record was highly suspicious for infection. Besides the well-known symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, this case 
also reports total anosmia and ageusia.

Abstract We describe two elderly patients evaluated at emergency departments for anosmia/dysgeusia in the absence of 

any other respiratory symptoms prior to or upon admission. In the current epidemiological context, clinical and 
biological work-up led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Unfortunately, one of the patients died during 
hospitalization, but the other recovered and was discharged.LEARNING POINTSIn the current epidemiological 
situation, anosmia and dysgeusia in the absence of other respiratory conditions should be carefully 
evaluated.Special attention should be given to patients with non-classic COVID-19 symptoms in order to 
reduce transmission and protect health providers.

Abstract There have been several reports noting anosmia and ageusia as possible symptoms of COVID-19. This is of 
particular interest in oncology since patients receiving some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or 
immune therapy often experience similar symptoms as side-effects. The purpose of this report was to 
summarise the evidence on the existence of anosmia and ageusia an emerging COVID-19 symptoms in order to 
better inform both oncology patients and clinicians. Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports 
noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that 
the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a 
new criterion to self-isolate. Whilst more data is currently needed to strengthen our knowledge of the 
symptoms of COVID-19, oncology patients who are concerned about anosmia or ageusia in the context of their 
systemic anti-cancer therapy should contact their acute oncology support line for advice.

Abstract AIMPharyngodynia, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, smell, and taste dysfunctions could be the presenting 

symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2. The aim was to perform a systematic review of current evidences on clinical presentation of COVID-19, 
focusing on upper airway symptoms in order to help otolaryngologists identifying suspected 
cases.METHODSWe searched PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases.RESULTSWe included 5 
retrospective clinical studies for a total of 1556 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 57.5% were male and 
mean age was 49.1 years. Pooled data revealed that pharyngodynia was present in 12.4% of patients, nasal 
congestion in 3.7%, and rhinorrhea was rare. No reports on COVID-19 and olfactory/gustative disorders 
matched inclusion criteria but preliminary evidences suggested they could be present. Common symptoms 
were fever (85.6%), cough (68.7%), and fatigue (39.4%). Frequent comorbidities were hypertension (17.4%), 
diabetes (3.8%), and coronary heart disease (3.8%); 83% of patients had alterations on chest computed 
tomography that were bilateral in 89.5% of cases. Ground-glass opacity was the most common finding (50%). 
Lymphopenia (77.2%) and leucopenia (30.1%) were common. Critical cases with complications were 9%, 
intensive care unit admission was required in 7.3%, invasive ventilation in 3.4%, and mortality was 
2.4%.CONCLUSIONOtolaryngologists should know that pharyngodynia, nasal congestion, olfactory, and 
gustative disorders could be the presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Clinical presentation together with 
radiological and laboratory findings could help to identify suspected cases.

Abstract BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, is responsible for the largest pandemic 
since the 1918 H1N1 influenza outbreak. The symptoms presently recognized by the World Health 
Organization are cough, fever, tiredness, and difficulty breathing. Patient-reported smell and taste loss has been 
associated with COVID-19 infection, yet no empirical olfactory testing on a cohort of COVID-19 patients has 
been performed.METHODSThe University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated 
40-odorant test, was administered to 60 confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and 60 age- and sex-matched controls 
to assess the magnitude and frequency of their olfactory dysfunction. A mixed effects analysis of variance 
determined whether meaningful differences in test scores existed between the two groups and if the test 
scores were differentially influenced by sex.RESULTSFifty-nine (98%) of the 60 patients exhibited some smell 
dysfunction [mean (95% CI) UPSIT score: 20.98 (19.47,22.48); controls: 34.10 (33.31,34.88); p<0.0001]. Thirty-
five of the 60 patients (58%) were either anosmic (15/60; 25%) or severely microsmic (20/60; 33%); 16 
exhibited moderate microsmia (16/60; 27%), 8 mild microsmia (8/60; 13%), and one normosmia (1/60; 2%). 
Deficits were evident for all 40 UPSIT odorants. No meaningful relationships between the test scores and sex, 
disease severity, or comorbidities were found.CONCLUSIONSQuantitative smell testing demonstrates that 
decreased smell function, but not always anosmia, is a major marker for SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggests the 
possibility that smell testing may help, in some cases, to identify COVID-19 patients in need of early treatment 
or quarantine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Abstract Early reports have suggested that smell loss may be an early symptom associated with the pandemic known as 
COVID-19. The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might cause 
olfactory dysfunction is certainly plausible. Patients presenting to specialized smell clinics are commonly 
diagnosed with upper respiratory infection (URI)-associated olfactory loss and most are presumed to be viral 
related. In acute phases of infection, it is common to experience some smell loss as a result of nasal 
inflammation, mucosal edema, and obstruction of airflow into the olfactory cleft. In most cases, these episodes 
of smell loss are self-limiting and coincide with resolution of URI symptoms. However, in some cases the smell 
loss persists for months to years and this is presumed to occur through a more direct olfactory insult by the 
virus. It remains too early to know whether infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes persistent olfactory dysfunction. 
However, given the scale of this pandemic, if SARS-CoV-2 does cause chronic olfactory loss in even a small 
portion of those infected, then the overall population prevalence could be quite large. This review provides a 
brief, practical overview of viral-associated olfactory loss, realizing that evidence related to COVID-19 will 
likely not be clear for some time. Our goal is to highlight the existence and importance of this condition and 
provide information geared for both providers and patients. Practical suggestions regarding evaluation and 
treatment will be provided, realizing that there may be constraints on medical resources and the nature of this 
pandemic remains dynamic. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Abstract The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has very high infectivity, which allows it to spread rapidly around the world. 

Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests 
performed. We propose that the olfactory epithelium from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate tissue 
for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the earliest stages, prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic 
people, as compared to commonly used sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs. Here we emphasize that the nasal 
cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple non-neuronal cell 
types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that 
facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the 
recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the possibility of 
subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we discuss the 
possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease. 
We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects of SARS-CoV-2 actions in the 
nervous system, especially in the olfactory pathway.

Abstract BACKGROUNDMedical publications about anosmia with COVID-19 are scarce. We aimed to describe the 
prevalence and features of anosmia in COVID-19 patients.METHODSWe retrospectively included COVID-19 
patients with anosmia between March 1 and March 17, 2020. We used SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR in 
respiratory samples to confirm the cases.RESULTSFifty-four of 114 patients (47%) with confirmed COVID-19 
reported anosmia. Mean age of the 54 patients was 47 (Â±16) years; 67% were females and 37% were 
hospitalized. The median Charlson comorbidity index was 0.70 (Â±1.6 [0-7]). Forty-six patients (85%) had 
dysgeusia and 28% presented with pneumonia. Anosmia began 4.4 (Â±1.9 [1-8]) days after infection onset. The 
mean duration of anosmia was 8.9 (Â±6.3 [1-21]) days and 98% of patients recovered within 28 
days.CONCLUSIONSAnosmia was present in half of our European COVID-19 patients and was often 
associated with dysgeusia.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe amelioration of the current COVID pandemic relies on swift and efficient case finding as 

well as stringent social distancing measures. Current advice suggests that fever or new onset dry cough are the 
commonest presenting complaints.METHODOLOGYWe present a case report and case series as well as other 
evidence that there is an important fourth presenting syndrome, namely isolated sudden onset anosmia (ISOA), 
which should be considered highly suspicious for SARS-CoV-2.RESULTSA patient presenting with ISOA who 
went on to test positive for infection with COVID-19 and did not develop any further symptoms as well as a 
case series of similar patients although limited by the lack of reliable testing at the moment.CONCLUSIONSWe 
posit the existence of a fourth common syndrome of COVID-19 infection: isolated sudden onset anosmia 
(ISOA) and urge the international community to consider this presentation in current management advice.

Abstract The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious zoonosis produced by SARS-CoV-2 that 
is spread human-to-human by respiratory secretions. It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. 
The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated 
comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, 
maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8% and 
20% of the infected population; some 15% will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their 
lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk 
to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all 
patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should 
be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a 
history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic 
inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected 
patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present 
condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with 
cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following 
settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness 
of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a 
minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the 
setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and 
tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel 
wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures 
described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In 
particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk 
of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in 
the present circumstances.

Abstract Novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, has caused pandemic of highly contagious disease called coronavirus disease 

2019 (COVID-19), with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and the USA. Primarily affecting the human respiratory 
system, SARS-CoV2 has some impact on the human brain, but apparently minimal on the cerebellum, at least so 
far. Neurological involvement in the acute phase appears to manifest with confusion, dizziness, impaired 
consciousness, propensity to develop acute strokes, anosmia, hypogeusia, ataxia, epilepsy, and neuralgia. 
Cerebellar scholars are facing a time of uncertainty. Telemedicine has suddenly emerged as an alternative to 
follow patients. There is an urgent need to develop novel platforms to assess and follow ataxic patients 
remotely, especially because cerebellar patients often require ambulatory care to maintain their autonomy.

Abstract BACKGROUND: Rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and concern for viral transmission by ambulatory 
patients with minimal to no symptoms underline the importance of identifying early or subclinical symptoms of 
Covid-19 infection. Two such candidate symptoms include anecdotally reported loss of smell and taste. 
Understanding the timing and association of smell/taste loss in Covid-19 may help facilitate screening and early 
isolation of cases. 
METHOD(S): A single-institution, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported symptoms with a focus on 
smell and taste was conducted using an internet-based platform on adult subjects who underwent testing for 
Covid-19. Logistic regression was employed to identify symptoms associated with Covid-19 positivity. 
RESULT(S): A total of 1480 patients with influenza-like symptoms underwent Covid-19 testing between March 
3 through 29, 2020. Our study captured 59 of 102 (58%) Covid-19-positive patients and 203 of 1378 (15%) 
Covid-19-negative patients. Smell and taste loss were reported in 68% (40/59) and 71% (42/59) of 
Covid-19-positive subjects, respectively, compared to 16% (33/203) and 17% (35/203) of Covid-19-negative 
patients (p<0.001). Smell and taste impairment were independently and strongly associated with 
Covid-19-positivity (anosmia: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 10.9, 95%CI:5.08-23.5; ageusia: aOR 10.2 
95%CI:4.74-22.1); whereas, sore throat was associated with Covid-19-negativity (aOR 0.23, 95%CI:0.11-0.50). 
Of patients who reported Covid-19-associated loss of smell, 74% (28/38) reported resolution of anosmia with 
clinical resolution of illness. 
CONCLUSION(S): In ambulatory individuals with influenza-like symptoms, chemosensory dysfunction was 
strongly associated with Covid-19 infection and should be considered when screening symptoms. Most will 
recover chemosensory function within weeks paralleling resolution of other disease-related symptoms. This

Abstract BACKGROUND: Initial reports describing COVID-19 were dominated by the presence of cough, 
breathlessness, and fever, anecdotal reports suggested anosmia may also be a manifestation. We sought to use 
Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to 
smell loss during the COVID-19 epidemic in the Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and Netherlands. 
METHOD(S): GT was used to explore Internet activity related to loss of smell in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, 
France, Iran and Netherlands. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss of smell relative search 
volumes (RSV) with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a 
control event, we also performed analysis of smell-related searches during the last UK Influenza epidemic of 
2009. 
RESULT(S): In all three countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, 
increases of daily COVID-19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically 
significant (p<0.05). 
CONCLUSION(S): There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell-related 
information and the onset of COVID-19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran and 
Netherlands. We would hypothesise this may relate to a previously under-recognised symptom. This article is

Abstract INTRODUCTION: Anosmia has not been formally recognised as a symptom of COVID-19 infection. Growing 
anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting 
that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new 
onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting 
new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical 
advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 
days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last 
week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In 
patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current 
guidelines for self-isolation. 
CONCLUSION(S): Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 
patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise 
asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required 
to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19.

Abstract Importance: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is serious and has the 

potential to become an epidemic worldwide. Several studies have described typical clinical manifestations 
including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our knowledge, it has not been reported that patients 
with COVID-19 had any neurologic manifestations. 
Objective(s): To study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19. 
Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from 
January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main District, 
West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 
Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. 
Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all 
neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 categories: 
central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular 
disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste impairment, smell impairment, 
vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury manifestations. 
Result(s): Of 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with COVID-19, 126 patients 
(58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe infection according to their respiratory 
status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere 
infection, patients with severe infection were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, 
and showed fewer typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection 
had neurologic manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired 
consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). 
Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. During the 
epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic manifestations, clinicians should suspect 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis 
or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat and prevent further transmission.

Abstract OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients with laboratory-
confirmed COVID-19 infection. 
METHOD(S): Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European 
hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, 
comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory 
questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). 
RESULT(S): A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most 
prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction 
were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory 
and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p<0.001). 
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases. The sQO-NS scores were 
significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p=0.001). 
Among the 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were hyposmic or anosmic. The 
early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0%. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory 
dysfunctions than males (p=0.001). 
CONCLUSION(S): Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, 
who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international 
scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.

Abstract PURPOSE:PURPOSE: Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. This study provides a 
brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical 
characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information 
useful in otolaryngologist practice. 
METHODS:METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms 
"COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" in conjunction with "otorhinolaryngological manifestation", "ENT", and "olfaction". 
RESULTS:RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and 
dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated 
sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger 
patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-
CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT 
surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. 
CONCLUSION:CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. 
During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of 
travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An 
otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while 
examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why 
some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is 
needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.

Abstract Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading quickly across the world, until a pandemic condition was 
announced by the WHO on March. Many clinical manifestations of this virus are described and new symptoms 
are emerging particularly outside respiratory sphere, such as anosmia and ageusia which are recent ORL 
published symptoms. About skin manifestation, few cases of rashes on patients with laboratory-confirmed 
Covid-19 were described in two Chineses cohorts.

Abstract OBJECTIVECausative viruses of postviral olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) have not yet been identified. The aim 
of this study was to investigate causative viruses in patients with PVOD.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSNasal 
discharge was collected from 24 patients with PVOD. We investigated the presence of 10 viruses in nasal 
discharge and examined the time course, with regard to changes in olfactory dysfunction and nasal obstruction 
in patients with PVOD, using questionnaires, acoustic rhinometry, and olfactory tests.RESULTSRhinoviruses 
were detected in 10 patients by electrophoresis. Rhinoviruses were also confirmed in four patients by 
nucleotide sequences. Viral serotypes were identified to be human rhinovirus (HRV)-40, HRV-75, HRV-78, and 
HRV-80. One of the four patients complained of anosmia, whereas another complained of dysosmia. Olfactory 
testing did not show significant improvement at 4, 8, 11, and 24 weeks after the first visit in the four patients, 
although results of acoustic rhinometry significantly improved. Two of the four patients complained of olfactory 
dysfunction even 6 months after the first visit. Coronavirus and parainfluenza virus were detected in one 
patient each, and Epstein-Barr viruses were detected in three patients.CONCLUSIONSThis study for the first 
time detected rhinovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and Epstein-Barr virus in nasal discharge of patients 
with PVOD. Furthermore, the present study suggests that rhinoviruses can cause olfactory dysfunction through 
mechanisms other than nasal obstruction and that rhinoviruses can induce various severities and different time 
courses of olfactory dysfunction.

Abstract This case was a 27 years old female with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). She suffered from typical 

symptoms of SARS. Although she got almost complete recovery from most symptoms after treatment, she 
noted acute onset complete anosmia 3 weeks after the onset of her first symptom. Her brain MRI examination 
did not show definite lesion except an incidental finding of left temporal epidermoid cyst. Her anosmia persisted 
for more than 2 years during following up. Peripheral neuropathy and myopathy have been reported as a 
concomitant problem during the convalescent stage of SARS, while the sequel of permanent ansomia in SARS 
was not reported before. Olfactory neuropathy, which rarely occurred in typical peripheral neuropathy, could 
be a special type of neuropathy induced by corona virus infection in SARS. Olfactory function test should be 
taken into routine check-up for patients with SARS. The pathophysiology and therapeutic strategy of this 
special type of permanent olfactory dysfunction deserve further investigation.
