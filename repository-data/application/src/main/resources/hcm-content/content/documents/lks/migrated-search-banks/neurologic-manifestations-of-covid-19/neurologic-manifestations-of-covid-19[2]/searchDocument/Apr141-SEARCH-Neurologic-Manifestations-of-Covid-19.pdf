Abstract:Novel coronavirus (SARS-Coronavirus-2:SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in Wuhan, China, has 
spread to multiple countries rapidly. We report the first case of meningitis associated with SARS-
CoV-2 who was brought in by ambulance due to a convulsion accompanied by unconsciousness. He 
had never been to any foreign countries. He felt generalized fatigue and fever (day 1). He saw 
doctors nearby twice (day 2 and 5) and was prescribed Laninamivir and antipyretic agents, His family 
visited his home and found that he was unconsciousness and lying on the floor in his vomit. He was 
immediately transported to this hospital by ambulance (day 9). Under emergency transport, he had 
transient generalized seizures that lasted about a minute. He had obvious neck stiffness. The specific 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a CSF. Anti- HSV 
1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. A brain MRI showed 
hyperintensity along the wall of right lateral ventricle and hyperintense signal changes in the right 
mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, suggesting the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 meningitis. This 
case warns the physicians of patients who have CNS symptoms.

Abstract:INTRODUCTIONClinical and experimental studies have shown that the coronavirus family 
has a certain tropism for the central nervous system. Seven types of coronavirus can infect 
humans.DEVELOPMENTCoronaviruses are not always confined to the respiratory tract, and under 
certain conditions they can invade the central nervous system and cause neurological pathologies. 
The potential for neuroinvasion is well documented in most human coronaviruses (OC-43, 229E, 
MERS and SARS) and in some animal coronaviruses (porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis 
coronavirus). Neurological symptoms have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19, such as 
headache, dizziness, myalgia and anosmia, as well as cases of encephalopathy, encephalitis, 
necrotising haemorrhagic encephalopathy, stroke, epileptic seizures, rhabdomyolysis and Guillain-
Barre syndrome, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.CONCLUSIONSFuture epidemiological studies 
and case records should elucidate the real incidence of these neurological complications, their 
pathogenic mechanisms and their therapeutic options.

Abstract:Emerging evidence indicates that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can cause neurological 
complications. We provide a brief overview of these recent observations and discuss some of their 
possible implications. In particular, given the global dimension of the current pandemic, we highlight 
the need to consider the possible long-term impact of COVID-19, potentially including neurological 
and neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Abstract:Novel outbreak with coronavirus 2019 began since 31 December 2019. Coronaviruses can 
cause multiple systemic infections that respiratory complications are the most obvious symptoms. In 
this report, we describe the symptoms of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in one infected patient with 
COVID-19, for the first time. We reported a 65-years- old male patient with complaints of acute 
progressive symmetric ascending quadriparesis. Two weeks prior to hospitalization, the patient 
suffered from cough, fever, and RT-PCR was reported positive for COVID-19 infection. The 
electrodiagnostic test showed that the patient is an AMSAN variant of GBS. COVID-19 stimulates 
inflammatory cells and produces various inflammatory cytokines and as a result, it creates immune-
mediated processes. GBS is an immune-mediated disorder and molecular mimicry as a mechanism of 
autoimmune disorder plays an important role in creating it. It is unclear whether COVID-19 induces 
the production of antibodies against specific gangliosides. Further investigations should be 
conducted about the mechanism of GBS in patients with COVID-19, in the future.Copyright © 2020

Abstract:Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), another highly pathogenic coronavirus named SARS-
CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCoV) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and rapidly 
spreads around the world. This virus shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV, and causes 
acute, highly lethal pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with clinical symptoms similar 
to those reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The most characteristic symptom of patients with 
COVID-19 is respiratory distress, and most of the patients admitted to the intensive care could not 
breathe spontaneously. Additionally, some patients with COVID-19 also showed neurologic signs, 
such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Increasing evidence shows that coronaviruses are not 
always confined to the respiratory tract and that they may also invade the central nervous system 
inducing neurological diseases. The infection of SARS-CoV has been reported in the brains from both 
patients and experimental animals, where the brainstem was heavily infected. Furthermore, some 
coronaviruses have been demonstrated able to spread via a synapse-connected route to the 
medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and 
lower respiratory airways. In light of the high similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2, it is quite 
likely that the potential invasion of SARS-CoV2 is partially responsible for the acute respiratory 
failure of patients with COVID-19. Awareness of this will have important guiding significance for the 
prevention and treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure.Copyright © 2020 Wiley

Abstract:The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by the novel severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has raised the possibility of potential neurotropic 
properties of this virus. Indeed, neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have already been 
reported and highlight the relevance of considering the neurological impact of coronavirus from a 
translational perspective. Animal models of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), 
caused by structurally similar coronaviruses during the 2002 and 2012 epidemics, have provided 
valuable data on nervous system involvement by coronaviruses and the potential for CNS spread of 
SARS-CoV-2. One key finding that may unify these pathogens is that all require angiotensin-
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The CoV spike glycoprotein, by which 
SARS_CoV-2 binds to cell membranes, binds ACE2 with a higher affinity compared to SARS-CoV. The 
expression of this receptor in neurons and endothelial cells hints that SARS-CoV-2 may have higher 
neuroinvasive potential compared to previous coronaviruses. Yet, how such invasiveness might 
contribute to respiratory failure or cause direct neurological damage remains to be determined. 
Both direct and indirect mechanisms may be of relevance. Clinical heterogeneity potentially driven 
by differential host immune-mediated responses will require extensive investigation. Development 
of disease models to anticipate emerging neurological complications and to explore mechanisms of 
direct or immune-mediated pathogenicity in the short- and medium- term is therefore of great 
importance. In this brief review, we describe the current knowledge from models of previous 
coronavirus infections and discuss their potential relevance to COVID-19.

Abstract:Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome in a 
substantial number of patients. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients need intensive care unit (ICU) 
admission and mechanical ventilation [1]. The primary symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry 
cough and fatigue [2]. However, a recent report from Shandong, China, disclosed that a subset of 
patients did not suffer from respiratory symptoms but had neurologic signs and symptoms [3]. 
Moreover, in a retrospective study from Wuhan, China, neurologic symptoms were observed in 
36.4% of the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and pertained to both the central and 
peripheral nervous system [4].

Abstract:An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection has recently emerged and 
rapidly spreading in humans causing a significant threat to international health and the economy. 
Rapid assessment and warning are crucial for an outbreak analysis in response to serious public 
health. SARS-CoV-2 shares highly homological sequences with SARS-CoVs causing highly lethal 
pneumonia with respiratory distress and clinical symptoms similar to those reported for SARS-CoV 
and MERS-CoV infections. Notably, some COVID-19 patients also expressed neurologic signs like 
nausea, headache, and vomiting. Several studies have reported that coronaviruses are not only 
causing respiratory illness but also invade the central nervous system through a synapse-connected 
route. SARS-CoV infections are reported in both patients and experimental animals' brains. 
Interestingly, some COVID-19 patients have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in their 
cerebrospinal fluid. Considering the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in various 
aspects, it remains to clarify whether the potent invasion of SARS-CoV-2 may affect in COVID-19 
patients. All these indicate that more detailed criteria are needed for the treatment and the 
prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In the absence of potential interventions for COVID-19, 
there is an urgent need for an alternative strategy to control the spread of this disease. This article is

Abstract:The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was identified after a recent outbreak in Wuhan, 
China, in December 2019, has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life-threatening 
nature of the infection. The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or 
anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. 
If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes 
much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the 
human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point 
to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be 
targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of 
patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe 
(encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be 
frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, 
immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus

specific therapeutic strategies with the available information to counteract the pandemic. In this 
Viewpoint, we provide a brief outline of the currently known neurological manifestations of COVID-
19 and discuss some probable ways to design therapeutic strategies to overcome the present global

Abstract:There has been a global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 
2019. In clinical practice, not only fever and respiratory tract symptoms but also multiple organ 
symptoms are observed in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Herein, we report a rare case of a 
patient diagnosed with COVID-19 who manifested with concomitant neurological symptoms. The 
patient developed fever and respiratory symptoms at disease onset, followed by muscle soreness, 
and subsequently altered consciousness and psychiatric symptoms, with positive signs based on 
neurological examination. The patient tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid (throat swab). Further, chest computed tomography (CT)

Abstract:OBJECTIVEIn this systematic review, we will discuss the evidence on the occurrence of 
central nervous system (CNS) involvement and neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-
19.METHODSMEDLINE (accessed from PubMed) and Scopus from December 01, 2019 to March 26, 
2020 were systematically searched for related published articles. In both electronic databases, the 
following search strategy was implemented and these key words (in the title/abstract) were used: 
"COVID 19" OR "coronavirus" AND "brain" OR "CNS" OR "neurologic".RESULTSThrough the search 
strategy, we could identify two articles about neurological involvement by COVID-19. One of these 
publications was a narrative review and the other one was a viewpoint. However, the authors 
scanned the reference lists of the included studies and could identify multiple references. One study, 
specifically investigated the neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and could document CNS 
manifestations in 25% of the patients. Most of the studies investigated the manifestations of COVID-
19 in general.CONCLUSIONWhile neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have not been studied 
appropriately, it is highly likely that some of these patients, particularly those who suffer from a 
severe illness, have CNS involvement and neurological manifestations. Precise and targeted 
documentation of neurological symptoms, detailed clinical, neurological, and electrophysiological 
investigations of the patients, attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid, and 
autopsies of the COVID-19 victims may clarify the role played by this virus in causing neurological 
manifestations.

Abstract:ImportanceThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is 
serious and has the potential to become an epidemic worldwide. Several studies have described 
typical clinical manifestations including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, to our 
knowledge, it has not been reported that patients with COVID-19 had any neurologic 
manifestations.ObjectiveTo study the neurologic manifestations of patients with COVID-19.Design, 
Setting, and ParticipantsThis is a retrospective, observational case series. Data were collected from 
January 16, 2020, to February 19, 2020, at 3 designated special care centers for COVID-19 (Main 
District, West Branch, and Tumor Center) of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science 
and Technology in Wuhan, China. The study included 214 consecutive hospitalized patients with 
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.Main 
Outcomes and MeasuresClinical data were extracted from electronic medical records, and data of all 
neurologic symptoms were checked by 2 trained neurologists. Neurologic manifestations fell into 3 
categories: central nervous system manifestations (dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, 
acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure), peripheral nervous system manifestations (taste 
impairment, smell impairment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and skeletal muscular injury 
manifestations.ResultsOf 214 patients (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [15.5] years; 87 men [40.7%]) with 
COVID-19, 126 patients (58.9%) had nonsevere infection and 88 patients (41.1%) had severe 
infection according to their respiratory status. Overall, 78 patients (36.4%) had neurologic 
manifestations. Compared with patients with nonsevere infection, patients with severe infection 
were older, had more underlying disorders, especially hypertension, and showed fewer typical 
symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever and cough. Patients with more severe infection had neurologic 
manifestations, such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired 
consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]), and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 
[4.8%]).Conclusions and RelevancePatients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic 
manifestations. During the epidemic period of COVID-19, when seeing patients with neurologic 
manifestations, clinicians should suspect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection 
as a differential diagnosis to avoid delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis and lose the chance to treat 
and prevent further transmission.

Abstract:INTRODUCTIONThere is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can gain access to the central 
nervous system (CNS). We revise the literature on coronavirus infection of the CNS associated with 
neurological diseases.DEVELOPMENTNeurological symptoms were rarely reported in the SARS-CoV 
and MERS-CoV epidemics, although isolated cases were described. There are also reports of cases of 
neurological symptoms associated with CoV-OC43 and CoV-229E infection. The presence of 
neurological lesions, especially demyelinating lesions in the mouse hepatitis virus model, may 
explain the mechanisms by which coronaviruses enter the CNS, particularly those related with the 
immune response. This may explain the presence of coronavirus in patients with multiple sclerosis. 
We review the specific characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and address the question of whether the high 
number of cases may be associated with greater CNS involvement.CONCLUSIONAlthough 
neurological symptoms are not frequent in coronavirus epidemics, the high number of patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the presence of the virus in the CNS and increase the likelihood of 
early- or delayed-onset neurological symptoms. Follow-up of patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 
epidemic should include careful assessment of the CNS.

Abstract:COVID-19 is caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, which is characterized by hidden onset, 
long incubation period, and high contagion. COVID-19 not only attacks the respiratory system, but 
also affects other systems such as the heart, kidney, and digestive tract, and could be combined with 
multiple system diseases such as acute cerebrovascular disease. If doctors, especially non-infective 
or respiratory doctors, do not pay great attention to the disease when they are receiving patients, 
and take good care of them, they may easily be infected. This article summarizes the case of a 
concealed onset COVID-19 patient with cerebral infarction, which caused a medical staff infection 
after intravenous thrombolytic therapy, explores its clinical characteristics, treatment process and 
analyzes its prevention and control links to help the epidemic situation. In the prevention and 
control of the disease, the first doctor should pay attention to identification, reduce missed 
diagnosis, and conduct scientific investigation to reduce occupational infectionCopyright © 2020 by

Abstract:COVID19 is a devastating global pandemic with epicenters in China, Italy, Spain, and now 
the United States. While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals 
present serious cardiorespiratory complications with possible long-term lung damage. Infected 
individuals report a range of symptoms from headaches to shortness of breath to taste and smell 
loss. To that end, less is known about the how the virus may impact different organ systems. The 
SARS-CoV2 virus, which is responsible for COVID19, is highly similar to SARS-CoV. Both viruses have 
evolved an ability to enter host cells through direct interaction with the angiotensin converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein at the surface of many cells. Published findings indicate that SARS-CoV can 
enter the human nervous system with evidence from both postmortem brains and detection in 
cerebrospinal fluid of infected individuals. Here we consider the ability of SARS-CoV2 to enter and 
infect the human nervous system based on the strong expression of the ACE2 target throughout the 
brain. Moreover, we predict that nicotine exposure through various kinds of smoking (cigarettes, e-
cigarettes, or vape) can increase the risk for COVID19 neuroinfection based on known functional 
interactions between the nicotinic receptor and ACE2. We advocate for higher surveillance and 
analysis of neuro-complications in infected cases.Copyright © 2020 American Society for

Abstract:The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has very high infectivity, which allows it to spread rapidly 
around the world. Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and 
quality of diagnostic tests performed. We propose that the olfactory epithelium from the nasal 
cavity may be a more appropriate tissue for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the earliest stages, 
prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic people, as compared to commonly used 
sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs. Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is 
the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple non-neuronal cell types present in the 
olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS-
CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the 
recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the possibility of 
subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we 
discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early 
stages of the disease. We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects 
of SARS-CoV-2 actions in the nervous system, especially in the olfactory pathway.

Abstract:Viral infections have detrimental impacts on neurological functions, and even to cause 
severe neurological damage. Very recently, coronaviruses (CoV), especially severe acute respiratory 
syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit neurotropic properties and may also cause neurological 
diseases. It is reported that CoV can be found in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid. The pathobiology of 
these neuroinvasive viruses is still incompletely known, and it is therefore important to explore the 
impact of CoV infections on the nervous system. Here, we review the research into neurological 
complications in CoV infections and the possible mechanisms of damage to the nervous system.
