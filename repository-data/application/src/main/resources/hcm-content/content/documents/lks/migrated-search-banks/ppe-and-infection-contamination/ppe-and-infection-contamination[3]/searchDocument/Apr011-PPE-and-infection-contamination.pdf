A. Original Research 

1. Comparison of infection control practices in a Dutch and US hospital using the 
infection risk scan (IRIS) method. 
Willemsen Ina American Journal of Infection Control 2020;48(4):391-397.  

• Using the Infection Risk Scan (IRIS), transparency in practices was created. • 
Comparable prevalence of antibiotic use, but the type of antibiotics varied. • ATP 
measurements revealed more contamination in the Dutch, than US hospital. • In the Dutch 
hospital no jewelry was worn; "bare below the elbow" was the standard. • Using the IRIS for 
benchmarking, local guidelines and policies need to be assessed. The infection risk scan 
(IRIS) is a tool to measure the quality of infection control (IC) and antimicrobial use in a 
standardized way. We describe the feasilibility of the IRIS in a Dutch hospital (the 
Netherlands, NL) and a hospital in the United States (US). Cross-sectional measurements 
were performed. Variables included a hand hygiene indicator, environmental contamination, 
IC preconditions, personal hygiene of health care workers, use of indwelling medical 
devices, and use of antimicrobials. IRIS was performed in 2 wards in a US hospital and 4 
wards in a Dutch hospital. Unjustified use of medical devices: none in the US hospital, 2.2% 
in the Dutch hospital; inappropriate use of antibiotics: 11.7% (US), 19% (NL); items 
considered not clean: 10% (US); 36% (NL); shortcomings preconditions: 6 of 20 (US), 6 of 
40 (NL); health care workers with rings, watches, or long sleeves: 34 of 43 (US), none in 
the NL hospital; and hand hygiene actions per patient/day: 41 (US) and 10 (NL). US data 
judged against the Dutch guidelines and vice versa revealed remarkable differences. We 
showed the feasibility of using the IRIS in a US hospital. The method provided insight in IC 
local performance. This method could be the first step to standardize the measurement of 
the quality of IC and antimicrobial use. However, if the IRIS is used for benchmarking 
between hospitals in different regions, this should be done in the context of regional 
guidelines and policies.

2. Covid-19: PHE upgrades PPE advice for all patient contacts with risk of infection 
Sayburn Anna BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online) 2020;369:No page numbers.  

New guidelines on use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare workers 
significantly expands the potential use of eye protection and fluid resistant surgical masks, 
including to doctors carrying out face-to-face assessments where a patient’s risk of covid-
19 is unknown.1 The updated guidance from Public Health England, which is in line with 
World Health Organization recommendations, allows for local risk assessment in hospitals 
and primary care.Situation Mask or respirator Apron or gown Eye protection Gloves

coronavirus is now widespread in the community," and so doctors are more likely to see 
patients infected with the virus who may not have symptoms, Public Health England said in 
a statement.2 The guidance emphasises, "Ultimately, where staff consider there is a risk to 
themselves or the individuals they are caring for they should wear a fluid repellent surgical 
mask with or without eye protection, as determined by the individual staff member for the 
episode of care or single session."The list of aerosol generating procedures has not 
changed from last week, although an evidence review of this is under way and may lead to 
changes in guidance.3 Types of personal protective equipment FFP3 (filtering facepiece) 
respirators filter at least 99% of airborne particles FFP2 and N95 respirators filter 94% and 
95% of particles and may be used if FFP3 respirators are not available Fluid resistant 
surgical masks (type IIR) provide barrier protection against droplets Eye and face protection 
can be a fluid resistant surgical mask with integrated visor, full face shield or visor, or 
polycarbonate safety spectacles Long sleeved, disposable, fluid repellent gowns must be 
worn "when a disposable plastic apron provides inadequate cover of staff uniform or 
clothes for the procedure or task being performed" and when there is "a risk of splashing of 
body fluids" If non-fluid resistant gowns are used, a disposable plastic apron should be 
worn underneath 1 Public Health England.

3. Bacterial Contamination of Military and Civilian Uniforms in an Emergency 
Department 
Anon. Journal of Emergency Nursing 2019;45(2):169.  

IntroductionThe emergency department is a fast-paced, high-volume environment, serving 
patients with diverse and evolving acuities. Personnel providing direct care are continually 
exposed to pathogenic microorganisms from patients and everyday surfaces, to which the 
organisms may spread. Indeed, hospital items—such as electronic devices, stethoscopes, 
and staff clothing—have demonstrated high rates of contamination. Despite this, policies 
governing the use, disinfection, and wear of various environmental surfaces remain 
relaxed, vague, and/or difficult to enforce. This study aimed to examine the bacterial 
contamination on 2 hospital uniform types in a large military hospital within the emergency 
department.MethodsEnvironmental sampling of military and civilian nursing staff uniforms 
was performed on 2 separate occasions. Emergency nurses wore hospital-provided freshly 
laundered scrubs on the first sampling day and home-laundered personally owned uniforms 
complicit with ED policy on the second sampling day. Samples were collected by 
impressing of contact blood agar growth medium at arrival (0 hour), 4 hours, and 8 hours of 
wear. Microbiological methods were used to enumerate and identify bacterial 
colonies.ResultsBacterial contamination of personally owned uniforms was significantly 
higher than freshly laundered hospital-provided scrubs on 4 different sampling sites and 
across the span of an 8-hour workday. No significant differences were observed between 
military and civilian personally owned uniforms. However, several risk factors for 
nosocomial infection were increased in the military subgroup.DiscussionRe-evaluating 
organizational factors (such as uniform policies) that increase the propensity for pathogenic 
contamination are critical for mitigating the spread and acquisition of multidrug-resistant 
organisms in the emergency department.

4. Long-sleeved medical workers' coats and their microbiota 
Berktold M. American Journal of Infection Control 2018;46(12):1408-1410.  

In this study we aimed to assess the contamination rate of long-sleeved medical workers' 
coats (N = 100) in a point-prevalence study. Ninety-one percent of the coats were 
contaminated with normal human flora, but only the minority (9%) showed presence of 
pathogenic non-multiresistant bacteria. The data of this study may implicate that long-
sleeved coats harbor low risk for the treated patients to be contaminated with pathogenic 
bacteria during medical consultation.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Association for 
Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. 

   

5. Do Long-sleeved Physician Coats Spread C. diff? 
Anon. Hospital Infection Control & Prevention 2017;44(12):9-9.  

The article discusses a 2017 study on the bare below the elbow physician attire to control 
infection. Topics covered include the mechanics of the study which involved mannequins 
and healthcare workers, and the simulation results of patient care which showed that the 
sleeve cuff of long-sleeve white coats frequently transferred a viral deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA) marker for Clostridium difficile. Also noted is the absence of transmission when short 
sleeves were worn.

7. A cross-sectional observational study about media and infection control practices: 
Are photographic portrayals of healthcare workers setting a bad example? 
Spierings E.J.W. Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 2015;4(1):No page 
numbers.  

Background: Attempts to increase compliance with infection control practices are complex 
and are - in part - based on attempts to change behaviour. In particular, the behaviour of 
significant peers (role models) has been shown to be a strong motivator. While role models 
within the working environment are obviously the most important, some experts suggest 
that media and public display cannot be ignored. The aim of this present study was to 
examine the display of technique recommended by current infection control guidelines 
including the "bare below the elbow" principle, which is considered a basic requirement for 
good infection control in many countries, in sets of professional stock photos. 
<br/>Finding(s): From 20 random photo-stock websites we selected pictures with search 
terms "doctor and patient" and "nurse and patient". In all selected photos a doctor or nurse 
and a patient were presented, healthcare workers (HCWs) were wearing white coats or 
uniforms, and their arms were visible. Each photo was evaluated with regard to: closure of 
white coat, sleeve length, personal clothing covered, hairstyle and presence of a 
wristwatch, bracelet and/or ring. Overall, 1600 photos were evaluated. The most common 
mistakes were with regard to HCWs' white coats/uniforms. Eighty-nine percent of the

photos containing doctor's images were considered incorrect while 28 % of nurse-
containing photos were incorrect. <br/>Conclusion(s): The results seem to reflect the real 
world with only 40 % displaying correct behaviour with doctors being worse than nurses. It 
seems that the stereotypical image of a doctor does not agree with the current infection 
control guidelines. If we aim for higher compliance rates of HCWs, we need to change the 
social image of doctors and improve production, selection and display of stock photo 
images.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Spierings et al.

8. Newly cleaned physician uniforms and infrequently washed white coats have similar 
rates of bacterial contamination after an 8-hour workday: A randomized controlled 
trial 
Burden M. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2011;6(4):177-182.  

BACKGROUND: Governmental agencies in the United Kingdom and Scotland have 
recently instituted guidelines banning physicians' white coats and the wearing of long-
sleeved garments to decrease nosocomial transmission of bacteria. <br/>OBJECTIVE(S):: 
Our aim was to compare the degree of bacterial and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus contamination of physicians' white coats with that of newly laundered, standardized 
short-sleeved uniforms after an 8-hour workday and to determine the rate at which bacterial 
contamination of the uniform ensued. DESIGN:: The design was a prospective, randomized 
controlled trial. SETTING:: The setting was a university-affiliated public safety-net hospital. 
PARTICIPANTS:: One hundred residents and hospitalists on an internal medicine service 
participated. INTERVENTION:: Subjects wore either a physician's white coat or a newly 
laundered short-sleeved uniform. MEASUREMENTS:: Bacterial colony count and the 
frequency with which methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from both 
garments over time were measured. <br/>RESULT(S):: No statistically significant 
differences were found in bacterial or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
contamination of physicians' white coats compared with newly laundered short-sleeved 
uniforms or in contamination of the skin at the wrists of physicians wearing either garment. 
Colony counts of newly laundered uniforms were essentially zero, but after 3 hours of wear 
they were nearly 50% of those counted at 8 hours. <br/>CONCLUSION(S):: Bacterial 
contamination occurs within hours after donning newly laundered short-sleeved uniforms. 
After 8 hours of wear, no difference was observed in the degree of contamination of 
uniforms versus infrequently laundered white coats. Our data do not support discarding 
long-sleeved white coats for short-sleeved uniforms that are changed on a daily basis.

9. Short or long sleeves make no difference to bacterial contamination of doctors' 
wrists. 
Mayor Susan BMJ: British Medical Journal (Overseas & Retired Doctors Edition) 
2011;342(7794):405-405.  

The article discusses research on doctors working at Denver Health, a university hospital in 
Colorado. It references a study by Marisha Burden and colleagues which showed that there 
is no greater risk of bacterial contamination among doctors wearing long sleeved outfits that 
those who wore short sleeves, refuting the guidelines of the National Health Service (NHS)

in Great Britain requiring doctors to be bare below the elbows. The study methodology is 
described. The study notes that there was no difference in bacterial or in meticillin resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contamination between doctors who wore short or long 
sleeves. Additionally, bacterial contamination is observed in newly laundered uniforms 
within hours of wearing them.

12. Infection control practices among hospital health and support workers in Hong Kong 
Chau J.P.C. Journal of Hospital Infection 2010;75(4):299-303.  

A report by the Hong Kong government noted that hospital infection control standards were 
inadequate, requiring audit, development and implementation. In addition, hospital staff 
needed training in infection control measures. We investigated infection control practices 
among 162 hospital health workers (109 nurses, 45 doctors and 8 therapists) and 44 
support workers in one acute hospital and two rehabilitation hospitals using a non-blinded, 
observational design. We examined compliance with isolation precautions and infection 
control guidelines, including proper wearing of a mask, goggles/face shield, or gown; 
handling patient care equipment, linen, and laundry; routine and terminal cleaning; and 
terminal cleaning of an isolation room. One major breakdown in compliance was use of 
sleeveless disposable plastic aprons instead of long-sleeved gowns during procedures 
likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood and body fluids. In more than half of the 
observed episodes, participants failed to disinfect medical devices, such as stethoscopes, 
before re-use. Thorough cleansing of commodes between patients was also lacking. 
Overall compliance with local and international infection control guidelines was satisfactory, 
but several aspects required improvement. &#xa9; 2009 The Hospital Infection Society. 

   

13. Patients' perceptions of doctors' clothing: Should we really be bare below the 
elbow? 
Bond L. Journal of Laryngology and Otology 2010;124(9):963-966.  

Introduction: In September 2007, the Department of Health published Uniforms and 
Workwear: an Evidence Base for Guiding Local Policy. Following this, most National Health 
Service trusts imposed a bare below the elbow dress code policy, with clinical staff asked to 
remove ties, wristwatches and hand jewellery and to wear short-sleeved tops. There is 
currently no evidence linking dress code to the transmission of hospital-acquired infection. 
We designed the current survey to assess patients' perceptions of doctors' appearance, 
with specific reference to the bare below the elbow policy.Materials and methods: A

questionnaire showing photographs of a doctor in three different types of attire (scrubs, 
formal attire and bare below the elbow) were used to gather responses from 80 in-patients 
and 80 out-patients in the ENT department. Patients were asked which outfit they felt was 
the most hygienic, the most professional and the easiest identification of the person as a 
doctor. They were also asked to indicate their overall preference.Results and analysis: 
Formal attire was considered most professional and the easiest identification that the 
person was a doctor. Scrubs were considered most hygienic. Respondents' overall 
preference was divided between scrubs and formal clothes. Bare below the elbow attire 
received the lowest votes in all categories. <br/>Discussion(s): This finding raises 
significant questions about the Department of Health policy in question. The authors 
suggest that an alternative policy should be considered, with scrubs worn for in-patient 
situations and formal attire during out-patient encounters. Copyright &#xa9; JLO (1984)

14. Reducing Clostridium difficile infection in acute care by using an improvement 
collaborative 
Power Maxine BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online) 2010;341:n.  

Problem In 2006, despite a focus on infection control, Salford Royal had the fourth highest 
rate of Clostridium difficile infection in north west England. Design Interrupted time series in 
five collaborative wards (intervention group) and 35 non-collaborative wards (control 
group). Setting University teaching hospital with 850 acute beds. Key measures for 
improvement Number of cases of C difficile infection per 1000 occupied bed days. 
Strategies for change In February 2007, a newly formed antimicrobial team led the 
implementation of revised guidelines in all wards and departments. From March to 
December 2007, five wards participated in an improvement collaborative. Since December 
2007, the changes from the collaborative have been collated and implemented throughout 
the organisation. Effects of change At baseline the non-collaborative wards had 1.15 (95% 
CI 1.03 to 1.29) cases per 1000 occupied bed days. In August 2007 cases reduced 56% 
from baseline (0.51, 0.44 to 0.60), which has been maintained since that time. In the 
collaborative wards, there were 2.60 (2.11 to 3.17) cases per 1000 occupied bed days at 
baseline. A shift occurred in April 2007 representing a reduction of 73% (0.69, 0.50 to 0.91) 
from baseline, which has been maintained. Lessons learnt Careful use of antimicrobial 
drugs is important in reducing the number of cases of C difficile infection. A collaborative 
learning model can enable teams to test and implement changes that can accelerate, 
amplify, and sustain control of C difficile.
