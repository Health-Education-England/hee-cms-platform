A. Original Research 

1. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) associated stress 
among medical students at a university teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia 
Al-Rabiaah A. Journal of Infection and Public Health 2020;:No page numbers.  

Background and objectives: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) 
outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media 
speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community 
was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the 
first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students' perception and 
determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. <br/>Method(s): We 
randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud 
University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by 
participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. <br/>Result(s): One 
hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher 
mean stress level than males (P &lt; 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 +/- 
3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean 
and median (17.4 +/- 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were 
the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) 
reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported 
moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score &gt;14). The stress 



Page 3 of 15 

 
level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in 
terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, 
self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female 
gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public 
fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the 
number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with 
higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. <br/>Conclusion(s): Medical students' 
psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. 
Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical 
students during an infectious disease outbreak.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

2. A systematic, thematic review of social and occupational factors associated with 
psychological outcomes in healthcare employees during an infectious disease 
outbreak 
Brooks Samantha Kelly Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine 
2018;60(3):248-257.  

Objective: To conduct a systematic literature review to identify social and occupational 
factors affecting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers involved in the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis. Methods: Four literature databases were 
searched and data extracted from relevant papers. Results: Eighteen thousand five papers 
were found and 22 included in the review. The psychological impact of SARS on 
employees appeared to be associated with occupational role; training/preparedness; high-
risk work environments; quarantine; role-related stressors; perceived risk; social support; 
social rejection/isolation; and impact of SARS on personal or professional life. Conclusions: 
To minimize the psychological impact of future outbreaks of infectious diseases, healthcare 
workers should be prepared for the potential psychological impact; employers should 
encourage a supportive environment in the workplace and ensure that support is in place 
for those most at risk, for example, those with the most patient contact. (PsycINFO

3. Global nursing in an Ebola viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak: before, during and 
after deployment. 
von Strauss Eva Global Health Action 2017;10(1):No page numbers.  

Background: Nurses are on the forefront and play a key role in global disaster responses. 
Nevertheless, they are often not prepared for the challenges they are facing and research 
is scarce regarding the nursing skills required for first responders during a disaster 
situation. Objectives: To investigate how returnee nursing staff experienced deployment 
before, during and after having worked for the Red Cross at an Ebola Treatment Center in 
Kenema, West Africa, and to supply knowledge on how to better prepare and support staff 
for viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional approach. 
Questionnaires were administered to nurses having worked with patients suffering from 
Ebola in 2014 and 2015. Data collection covered aspects of pre-, during and post-
deployment on clinical training, personal health, stress management, leadership styles, 
socio-cultural exposure and knowledge transfer, as well as attitudes from others. Data was

analysed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: Response-rate was 
88%: forty-four nurses from 15 different countries outside West Africa answered the 
questionnaire. The respondents identified the following needs for improvement: increased 
mental health and psychosocial support and hands-on coping strategies with focus on pre- 
and post-deployment; more pre-deployment task-oriented clinical training; and workload 
reduction, as exhaustion is a risk for safety. Conclusions: This study supplies knowledge on 
how to better prepare health care staff for future viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks and 
other disasters. Participants were satisfied with their pre-deployment physical health 
preparation, whereas they stressed the importance of mental health support combined with 
psychosocial support after deployment. Furthermore, additional pre-clinical training was 
requested.

4. Review of Occupational health for humanitarian aid workers in an Ebola outbreak 
Taoka Sachiko Journal of Research in Nursing 2016;21(1):37-38.  

Reviews the article, Occupational Health for Humanitarian Aid Workers in an Ebola 
Outbreak by Hannele Haggman Joyce Kenkre and Carole Wallace (see record 2016-
10448-005). This review article briefs the Guidelines and advice around occupational health 
and safety during an Ebola outbreak including prevention of Ebola in the workplace and 
responsibilities of staff, volunteers and employers have been developed. However, to date, 
there is little information to support the value of such guidance from the perspective of 
those who have worked in an Ebola outbreak. Findings from this paper illustrate the 
importance of health briefing, informing the delegate’s family, standard operating 
procedures, appropriate training and recruiting a focal point for staff health-related 
questions. The occupational health needs of national staff and volunteers affiliated with 
organisations who took part in controlling the Ebola outbreak cannot be overlooked. The 
findings from this study may be able to provide insight into further support needed for 
national clinical and non-clinical staff and volunteers and further studies are warranted in 
this area. The potential exists for further research in an Ebola context into the various types 
and the benefits of psychological support available for national and international 
humanitarian aid workers experiencing stress, as well as stigma in-country and for those 
returning to their respective countries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

5. Exposure to war traumatic experiences, post-traumatic stress disorder and post-
traumatic growth among nurses in Gaza 
Shamia N. A. Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing 2015;22(10):749-755.  

Aim: To establish the association between war traumatic experiences, post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) symptoms and post-traumatic growth among nurses in the Gaza Strip, 2 
years after an incursion on Gaza, and during a period of ongoing trauma exposure. This 
study builds on existing evidence by considering exposure to personal and work-related 
traumatic events, and on factors associated with later positive psychological adaptation. 
Methods: The sample consisted of 274 randomly selected nurses in Gaza who completed 
the Gaza Traumatic Events Checklist, PTSD Checklist, and Posttraumatic Growth 
Inventory. Results: Of the nurses, 19.7% reported full PTSD. There was a significant 
relationship between traumatic events and PTSD scores; as well as between community-

related traumatic events and post-traumatic growth. Participants reported a range of 
traumatic events, but PTSD and post-traumatic growth scores were more strongly 
associated with community rather than work-related traumas. Discussion: Nursing 
professionals experienced high levels of distress 2 years following an acute period of 
conflict, both as civilians and in their health-care capacity. Implications for Practice: There is 
need for different levels of support for health-care staff in war-affected areas. Mental health 
nursing professionals have a central role in training, counselling and support to other 
health-care colleagues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

6. Military nurses' experiences returning from war 
Elliott Brenda Journal of Advanced Nursing 2015;71(5):1066-1075.  

Aim: This paper is a report of a study conducted to describe the military nurses' post-
deployment experiences and their meaning. Background: Today, similar to past conflicts, 
military nurses are faced with many different stressors, moral dilemmas and loss in a 
compressed amount of time while deployed. These exposures place both military nurses 
and their families at risk for difficulty adjusting when deployment ends. This study 
addresses military nurses' experiences returning to personal and professional roles post-
deployment. Design Qualitative, narrative inquiry. Method: Thematic analysis of data 
collected in 2012 from in-depth semi-structured interviews with ten military nurses. 
Findings: Description of the experience had five themes: ‘learning to manage changes in 
the environment’; ‘facing the reality of multiple losses’; ‘feeling like it's all so trivial now’; 
‘figuring out where I ‘fit’ in all the chaos'; and ‘working through the guilt to move forward’. 
Description of the meaning of the experience had two themes: ‘serving a greater purpose’ 
and ‘looking at life through a new lens’. Conclusion: It is critical for military nurses and 
leaders, healthcare providers, nursing administration/educators, as well as nurses who 
work alongside military nurses, both in the USA and in other countries, to have a better 
understanding of the meaning of the deployment experience so they may provide support 
to these nurses during the post-deployment phase. Lessons learned may benefit future 
military nurses and may also be transferable to nurses who support humanitarian and 
disaster missions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source:

7. Voices of HIV&AIDS-affected educators: how they are psychosocially affected and 
how REds enabled their resilience. 
Delport Rina AIDS Care 2011;23(1):121-126.  

The aim of this article is to hear the voices of HIV- and AIDS-affected educators regarding 
their experiences of the psychosocial effect that the HIV and AIDS pandemic has on them 
as well as to voice their experiences of how Resilient Educators (REds), a support 
programme to enable educators affected by HIV and AIDS towards resilience, enabled 
them. A qualitative study was undertaken with 100 affected educators from different 
provinces in South Africa. Open-ended questionnaires were used to collect data prior to 
and after exposure to REds. The results suggested that the pandemic had a devastating 
effect not only at a professional level, but also at all the personal levels of educators' well-
being, namely, at an emotional, spiritual, physical and social level. However, the results 
also indicated that REds empowered them to cope more resiliently with the overwhelming 
personal and professional impacts of living and teaching in an HIV- and AIDS-altered 
milieu. It thus seems as if REds, as an empowering programme, has the potential to 
become a valuable protective resource in an educational context that is HIV-lacerated.

8. Psychosocial impacts of quarantine during disease outbreaks and interventions that 
may help to relieve strain 
Johal S.S. New Zealand Medical Journal 2009;122(1296):47-52.  

The threat of outbreak of infectious disease such as non-seasonal influenza A (H1N1), 
commonly referred to as Swine Flu, can provoke the implementation of public health control 
measures such as quarantine. This paper summarises the psychosocial consequences that 
may follow for patients and health care and other front-line workers when using quarantine 
controls. Those affected by quarantine are likely to report distress due to fear and risk 
perceptions. This distress can be amplified in the face of unclear information and 
communication that is common in the initial period of disease outbreaks. This paper 
outlines recommendations for care of those in quarantine and those working with them, 
such as helping to identify stressors and normalising their impact as much as possible. This 
should take place at all levels of response, from public information and communication 
messages to individual face-to-face advice and support. &#xa9; NZMA.

9. Surviving a life-threatening crisis: Taiwan s nurse leaders reflections and difficulties 
fighting the sars epidemic 
Shih Fu-Jin Journal of Clinical Nursing 2009;18(24):3391-3400.  

Aim: This study explored Taiwan's nurse leaders reflections and experiences of the 
difficulties they encountered and survival strategies they employed fighting the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome epidemic and the background context framing these 
phenomena. Background: On several continents in 2002 2003, the highly infectious severe 
acute respiratory syndrome overwhelmed health care systems and health professionals 
who had to provide care in situations involving high personal risk and stress, some 
becoming infected and dying. Nurse leaders in Taiwan had to develop new strategies and 
support systems for nursing care. Design: A two-step within-method qualitative triangulation 
research design. Methods: Focus group in-depth interviews held with 70 nurse leaders from 
four Northern Taiwan hospitals involved in the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. 
Participants then completed an open ended questionnaire. Content analysis was 
undertaken with data and stages and themes generated. Data were then analysed using 
Hobfall's concepts of conservation of resources to further discuss participants reactions and 
actions in the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis. Results: Participants worked under 
incredible stress to lead the profession through a period of crisis. Five stages arose in the 
participants involvement against severe acute respiratory syndrome over 12 weeks: facing 
shock and chaos; searching for reliable sources to clarify myths; developing and adjusting 
nursing care; supporting nurses and their clients; and rewarding nurses. Conclusion: Nurse 
leaders become important executors of intervention in this health disaster, requiring 
emotional intelligence to manage their internal conflicts and interpersonal relationships 
effectively. They developed sociopolitical and analytical abilities and crucial requirements 
for planning and implementing strategies in areas where none previously existed. Building 
support systems was an important resource for managing conflicts between familial and 
professional roles. Relevance to clinical practice: Findings will assist nurse leaders to 
prepare themselves and the profession to better deal with disaster management in similar 
infectious outbreaks in the future. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

10. Applying the lessons of SARS to pandemic influenza: an evidence-based approach 

to mitigating the stress experienced by healthcare workers. 
Maunder RG Canadian Journal of Public Health 2008;99(6):486-488.  

We describe an evidence-based approach to enhancing the resilience of healthcare 
workers in preparation for an influenza pandemic, based on evidence about the stress 
associated with working in healthcare during the SARS outbreak. SARS was associated 
with significant long-term stress in healthcare workers, but not with increased mental 
illness. Reducing pandemic-related stress may best be accomplished through interventions 
designed to enhance resilience in psychologically healthy people. Applicable models to 
improve adaptation in individuals include Folkman and Greer's framework for stress 
appraisal and coping along with psychological first aid. Resilience is supported at an 
organizational level by effective training and support, development of material and relational 
reserves, effective leadership, the effects of the characteristics of "magnet hospitals," and a 
culture of organizational justice. Evidence supports the goal of developing and maintaining 
an organizational culture of resilience in order to reduce the expected stress of an influenza 
pandemic on healthcare workers. This recommendation goes well beyond the provision of 
adequate training and counseling. Although the severity of a pandemic is unpredictable, 
this effort is not likely to be wasted because it will also support the health of both patients 
and staff in normal times.

11. Prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Toronto hospital workers one to two 
years after the SARS outbreak 
Lancee William J. Psychiatric Services 2008;59(1):91-95.  

Objective: This study aimed to determine the incidence of psychiatric disorders among 
health care workers in Toronto in the one- to two-year period after the 2003 outbreak of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to test predicted risk factors. Methods: 
New-onset episodes of psychiatric disorders were assessed among 139 health care 
workers by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Clinician- 
Administered PTSD Scale. Past history of psychiatric illness, years of health care 
experience, and the perception of adequate training and support were tested as predictors 
of the incidence of new-onset episodes of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak. 
Results: The lifetime prevalence of any depressive, anxiety, or substance use diagnosis 
was 30%. Only one health care worker who identified the SARS experience as a traumatic 
event was diagnosed as having PTSD. New episodes of psychiatric disorders occurred 
among seven health care workers (5%). New episodes of psychiatric disorders were 
directly associated with a history of having a psychiatric disorder before the SARS outbreak 
(p = .02) and inversely associated with years of health care experience (p = .03) and the 
perceived adequacy of training and support (p = .03). Conclusions: Incidence of new 
episodes of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak were similar to or lower than 
community incidence rates, which may indicate the resilience of health care workers who 
continued to work in hospitals one to two years after the SARS outbreak. In preparation for 
future events, such as pandemic influenza, training and support may bolster the resilience 
of health care workers who are at higher risk by virtue of their psychiatric history and fewer 
years of health care experience. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

12. Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation of the nurses in a 
structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic 
assessment study in Taiwan 
Su Tung-Ping Journal of Psychiatric Research 2007;41(1-2):119-130.  

To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of 
the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of 
psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non- 
SARS units. Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and 
SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]). 
Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress 
symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed 
that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater 
in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two 
groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), 
yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher 
rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p < 0.05). For the SARS unit 
nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings 
as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p < 
0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of 
nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more 
severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular 
SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS 
patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. 
Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against 
acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-
disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work 
environment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source:

13. The relevance of psychosocial variables and working conditions in predicting 
nurses' coping strategies during the SARS crisis: An online questionnaire survey 
Marjanovic Zdravko International Journal of Nursing Studies 2007;44(6):991-998.  

Objectives: The purpose of this investigation was to examine the relationship between 
psychosocial variables and working conditions, and nurses' coping methods and distress in 
response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Canada. Participants 
and procedure: The sample consisted of 333 nurses (315 women, 18 men) who completed 
an Internet-mediated questionnaire that was posted on the Registered Nurses' Association 
of Ontario (RNAO) website between March and May 2004. The questionnaire was 
restricted to respondents who had to authenticate their RNAO membership with a valid 
username and password before accessing the questionnaire. This served a dual purpose: 
to ensure that only RNAO nurses completed the questionnaire and thereby safeguarding 
the generalizability of the findings; and second, to prevent any one nurse from contributing 
more than once to the overall sample. Results: Correlational analysis yielded several 
significant relationships between psychosocial variables and working conditions, and the 
traditional correlates of burnout and stress. Three multiple regression analysis revealed that 
the model we evolved--including higher levels of vigor, organizational support, and trust in 
equipment/infection control initiative; and lower levels of contact with SARS patients, and

time spent in quarantine--predicted to lower levels of avoidance behavior, emotional 
exhaustion, and state anger. Conclusions: By employing models of stress and burnout that 
combine psychosocial variables and working conditions, researchers can account for 
significant amounts of variance in outcomes related to burnout. These findings highlight the 
importance of vigor and perceived organizational support in predicting nurses' symptoms of 
burnout. For healthcare administrators, this means that a likely strategy for assuaging the 
negative outcomes of stress should address nurses' psychosocial concerns and the 
working conditions that they face during novel times of crisis. (PsycINFO Database Record

14. Long-term psychological and occupational effects of providing hospital healthcare 
during SARS outbreak 
Maunder R.G. Emerging Infectious Diseases 2006;12(12):1924-1932.  

Healthcare workers (HCWs) found the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) to be stressful, but the long-term impact is not known. From 13 to 26 months after 
the SARS outbreak, 769 HCWs at 9 Toronto hospitals that treated SARS patients and 4 
Hamilton hospitals that did not treat SARS patients completed a survey of several adverse 
outcomes. Toronto HCWs reported significantly higher levels of burnout (p = 0.019), 
psychological distress (p&lt;0.001), and posttraumatic stress (p&lt;0.001). Toronto workers 
were more likely to have reduced patient contact and work hours and to report behavioral 
consequences of stress. Variance in adverse outcomes was explained by a protective 
effect of the perceived adequacy of training and support and by a provocative effect of 
maladaptive coping style and other individual factors. The results reinforce the value of 
effective staff support and training in preparation for future outbreaks.

15. Facing SARS: Psychological impacts on SARS team nurses and psychiatric services 
in a Taiwan general hospital 
Lee Shwu-Hua General Hospital Psychiatry 2005;27(5):352-358.  

Objective: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 resulted in 
346 probable SARS cases and 37 deaths in Taiwan. This descriptive study, which was 
conducted from May to June 2003, intended to identify staff stress and coping strategies 
among a SARS team of nursing staff during the outbreak. Method: Twenty-six female 
nurses of the SARS team completed a questionnaire about their experiences serving in the 
SARS team. Results: SARS had both positive and negative psychological impacts on the 
nurses. While worrying about infecting their families and colleagues, nurses were able to 
cope with the situation through various means. Additional findings include the need for 
more psychiatric staff to provide flexible and continuous service, the importance of 
meetings to improve teamwork and reduce conflict between doctors and nurses and the 
useful discovery that video cell phones provided needed reassurance from afar to the 
worried families of the nurses. Conclusion: This study reinforces the importance and 
benefits of psychiatric services for SARS team members in reducing their secondary 
traumatization. It is hoped that the results will enhance our knowledge on the needs of 
frontline health care workers and support the planning of better psychiatric services in 
future epidemics. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) (Source:

16. The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on medical house staff: A 

qualitative study 
Rambaldini G. Journal of General Internal Medicine 2005;20(5):381-385.  

OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on a 
medical training program and to develop principles for professional training programs to 
consider in dealing with future, similar crises. DESIGN: Qualitative interviews analyzed 
using grounded theory methodology. SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals in Toronto, 
Canada during the SARS outbreak in 2003. PARTICIPANTS: Medical house staff who were 
allocated to a general internal medicine clinical teaching unit, infectious diseases 
consultation service, or intensive care unit. <br/>RESULT(S): Seventeen medical residents 
participated in this study. Participants described their experiences during the outbreak and 
highlighted several themes including concerns about their personal safety and about the 
negative impact of the outbreak on patient care, house staff education, and their emotional 
well-being. <br/>CONCLUSION(S): The ability of residents to cope with the stress of the 
SARS outbreak was enhanced by the communication of relevant information and by the 
leadership of their supervisors and infection control officers. It is hoped that training 
programs for health care professionals will be able to implement these tenets of crisis 
management as they develop strategies for dealing with future health threats.

17. Psychological impact of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak on 
health care workers in a medium size regional general hospital in Singapore 
Chan A.O.M. Occupational Medicine 2004;54(3):190-196.  

Aims. To describe the psychological impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 
on health care workers in a regional general hospital 2 months post-outbreak. 
<br/>Method(s): Doctors and nurses were encouraged to participate. The survey consisted 
of self-report measures: demographics, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 28 and 
Impact of Events Scale (IES). A questionnaire enquiring about changes in life's priorities 
due to SARS and circumstances that helped with coping was used. Participation was 
strictly voluntary and responses anonymous. <br/>Result(s): In total 177 out of 661 (27%) 
participants [40 out of 113 (35%) doctors and 137 out of 544 (25%) nurses] had a GHQ 28 
score &gt;=5. Doctors [P = 0.026, odds ratio (OR) = 1.6 and 95% confidence interval (CI) = 
1.1-2.5] and single health care workers were at higher risk (P = 0.048, OR = 1.4 and 95% 
CI = 1.02-2.0) compared to nurses and those who were married. Approximately 20% of the 
participants had IES scores &gt;= 30, indicating the presence of post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD). Four areas were classified as more important using factor analysis: health 
and relationship with the family, relationship with friends/colleagues, work and spiritual. The 
areas for coping strategies were clear directives/precautionary measures, ability to give 
feedback to/obtain support from management, support from supervisors/colleagues, 
support from the family, ability to talk to someone and religious convictions. Support from 
supervisors/colleagues was a significant negative predictor for psychiatric symptoms and 
PTSD. Work and clear communication of directives/precautionary measures also helped 
reduce psychiatric symptoms. <br/>Conclusion(s): Many health care workers were 
emotionally affected and traumatized during the SARS outbreak. Hence, it is important for

18. Psychological responses to the SARS outbreak in healthcare students in Hong Kong 
Wong J.G.W.S. Medical Teacher 2004;26(7):657-659.  

This paper reports a cross-sectional questionnaire study that investigated perceived stress 
and psychological responses to the SARS outbreak in healthcare students at the height of 
the outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003. Non-healthcare university students served as controls. 
All the groups reported high levels of perceived stress. Despite being similarly confident in 
infection control procedures, nursing students were significantly more stressed than 
medical students, possibly reflecting a perceived higher risk of infection due to more 
prolonged contact with patients. Non-healthcare students also had high stress levels due to 
the perceived risks of dying from SARS, reflecting a fear of the unknown. Suitable 
psychological and occupational support services should be made available in case of future 
outbreaks. &#xa9; 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd. 

   

19. Psychosocial effects of SARS on hospital staff: Survey of a large tertiary care 
institution 
Nickell Leslie A. Canadian Medical Association Journal 2004;170(5):793-798.  

Background: The outbreak of SARS in 2003 had a dramatic effect on the health care 
system in Toronto. The main objective of this study was to investigate the psychosocial 
effects associated with working in a hospital environment during this outbreak. Methods: 
Questionnaires were distributed to all willing employees of Sunnybrook and Women's 
College Health Sciences Centre between Apr. 10 and 22, 2003. The survey included 
questions regarding concern about SARS, precautionary measures, personal well-being 
and sociodemographic characteristics; a subsample also received the 12-item version of 
the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results: Of the 4283 questionnaires 
distributed, 2001 (47%) were returned, representing 27% of the total hospital employee 
population of 7474. The proportions of respondents who were allied health care 
professionals, nurses and doctors and who worked in areas other than patient care were 
representative of the hospital staff population as a whole. Of the 2001 questionnaires, 510 
contained the GHQ-12. Two-thirds of the respondents reported SARS-related concern for 
their own or their family's health. A total of 148 respondents (29%) scored above the 
threshold point on the GHQ-12, indicating probable emotional distress; the rate among 
nurses was 45%. Masks were reported to be the most bothersome infection control 
precaution. Logistic regression analysis identified 4 factors as being significantly associated 
with increased levels of concern for personal or family health: perception of a greater risk of 
death from SARS (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-9.6), living 
with children (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.3), personal or family lifestyle affected by 
SARS outbreak (adjusted OR 3.3, 95% CI 2.5-4.3) and being treated differently by people 
because of working in a hospital (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1). Four factors were 
identified as being significantly associated with the presence of emotional distress: being a 
nurse (adjusted OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.5), part-time employment status (adjusted OR 2.6, 
95% CI 1.2-5.4), lifestyle affected by SARS outbreak (adjusted OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.5) 
and ability to do one's job affected by the precautionary measures (adjusted OR 2.9, 95% 
CI 1.9-4.6). Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the SARS outbreak had significant 
psychosocial effects on hospital staff. These effects differed with respect to occupation and

risk perception. The effect on families and lifestyle was also substantial. These findings 
highlight the need for interventions to address psychosocial distress and concern and to 
provide support for employees during such crises. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

20. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003: Stress and 
psychological impact among frontline healthcare workers 
Tam Cindy W. C. Psychological Medicine 2004;34(7):1197-1204.  

Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) posed an 
unprecedented threat and a great challenge to health professionals in Hong Kong. The 
study reported here aimed at investigating the origin of stress and psychological morbidity 
among frontline healthcare workers in response to this catastrophe. Method: Self-
administered questionnaires were sent to frontline healthcare workers in three hospitals. 
The General Health Questionnaire was used to identify psychological distress. Socio-
demographic and stress variables were entered into a logistic regression analysis to find 
out the variables associated with psychological morbidity. Results. The response rate was 
40%. Sixty-eight per cent of participants reported a high level of stress. About 57% were 
found to have experienced psychological distress. The healthcare workers' psychological 
morbidity was best understood by the perceptions of personal vulnerability, stress and 
support in the workplace. Conclusion: These findings shed light on the need for hospital 
administrators to be aware of the extent and sources of stress and psychological distress 
among frontline healthcare workers during disease outbreak. (PsycINFO Database Record

22. The immediate psychological and occupational impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak in 
a teaching hospital 
Maunder R. CMAJ 2003;168(10):1245-1251.  

Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, which 
began on Mar. 7, 2003, resulted in extraordinary public health and infection control 
measures. We aimed to describe the psychological and occupational impact of this event 
within a large hospital in the first 4 weeks of the outbreak and the subsequent 
administrative and mental health response. <br/>Method(s): Two principal authors met with 
core team members and mental health care providers at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, to 
compile retrospectively descriptions of the experiences of staff and patients based on 
informal observation. All authors reviewed and analyzed the descriptions in an iterative 
process between Apr. 3 and Apr. 13, 2003. <br/>Result(s): In a 4-week period, 19

individuals developed SARS, including 11 health care workers. The hospital's response 
included establishing a leadership command team and a SARS isolation unit, implementing 
mental health support interventions for patients and staff, overcoming problems with 
logistics and communication, and overcoming resistance to directives. Patients with SARS 
reported fear, loneliness, boredom and anger, and they worried about the effects of 
quarantine and contagion on family members and friends. They experienced anxiety about 
fever and the effects of insomnia. Staff were adversely affected by fear of contagion and of 
infecting family, friends and colleagues. Caring for health care workers as patients and 
colleagues was emotionally difficult. Uncertainty and stigmatization were prominent themes 
for both staff and patients. <br/>Interpretation(s): The hospital's response required clear 
communication, sensitivity to individual responses to stress, collaboration between 
disciplines, authoritative leadership and provision of relevant support. The emotional and 
behavioural reactions of patients and staff are understood to be a normal, adaptive 
response to stress in the face of an overwhelming event.
