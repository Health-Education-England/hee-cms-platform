A thorough search was conducted on high-level evidence sources including NICE HDAS, UK 
Government websites and other grey literature sources.  The search did not find any specific data 
on domiciliary worker ethnicity in Thurrock and found few resources on using AGPs in home care. I 
have included relevant articles and guidance on the topic which you may find useful.   Here are key

The survey, (conducted by the Runnymede Trust and ICM in June 2020), illuminates why BME 
groups are at greater risk from Covid-19: they are more likely to be working outside their home, 
more likely to be using public transport, more likely to be working in key worker roles, less likely to 
be protected with PPE and more likely to live in multigenerational, overcrowded housing, so much 
less able to self-isolate and shield.

2. Coronavirus Disease Pandemic (COVID-19): Challenges and a Global Perspective. 
Malik Yashpal Singh Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland) 2020;9(7):No page numbers.  

The technology-driven world of the 21st century is currently confronted with a major threat 
to humankind, represented by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of now, COVID-
19 has affected more than 6 million confirmed cases and took 0.39 million human lives. 
SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster than its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), but has low fatality rates. Our analyses speculate 
that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-
density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin -
like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2') within the spike protein. Given the high genomic 
similarities of SARS-CoV-2 to bat SARS-like CoVs, it is likely that bats serve as a reservoir 
host for its progenitor. Women and children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
while the elderly and people with comorbidities are more prone to serious clinical outcomes, 
which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine 
storm. The cohesive approach amongst researchers across the globe has delivered high -
end viral diagnostics. However, home-based point-of-care diagnostics are still under 
development, which may prove transformative in current COVID-19 pandemic containment. 
Similarly, vaccines and therapeutics against COVID-19 are currently in the pipeline for 
clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the noteworthy advancements, focusing on the 
etiological viral agent, comparative genomic analysis, population susceptibility, disease 
epidemiology and diagnosis, animal reservoirs, laboratory animal models, disease 
transmission, therapeutics, vaccine challenges, and disease mitigation measures.

3. COVID-19 Preparedness in US Home Health Care Agencies 
Shang J. Journal of the American Medical Directors Association 2020;21(7):924-927.  

Objectives: In the United States, home health agencies (HHAs) provide essential services 
for patients recovering from post-acute care and older adults who are aging in place. During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, HHAs may face additional challenges caring for these vulnerable 
patients. Our objective was to explore COVID-19 preparedness of US HHAs and compare 
results by urban/rural location. <br/>Design(s): Cross-sectional study. Setting/Participants: 
Using a stratified random sample of 978 HHAs, we conducted a 22-item online survey from 
April 10 to 17, 2020. <br/>Method(s): Summary statistics were computed; open-ended 
narrative responses were synthesized using qualitative methods. <br/>Result(s): Similar to 
national data, most responding HHAs (n = 121, 12% response rate) were for-profit and 
located in the South. Most HHAs had infectious disease outbreaks included in their 
emergency preparedness plan (76%), a staff member in charge of outbreak/disaster 
preparedness (84%), and had provided their staff with COVID-19 education and training 
(97%). More urban HHAs had cared for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 patients than 
rural HHAs, but urban HHAs had less capacity to test for COVID-19 than rural HHAs (9% 
vs 21%). Most (69%) experienced patient census declines and had a current and/or 
anticipated supply shortage. Rural agencies were affected less than urban agencies. HHAs 
have already rationed (69%) or implemented extended use (55%) or limited reuse (61%) of 
personal protective equipment (PPE). Many HHAs reported accessing supplemental PPE 
from state/local resources, donations, and do-it-yourself efforts; more rural HHAs had 
accessed these additional resources compared with urban HHAs. Conclusions/Implications: 
This survey reveals challenges that HHAs are having in responding to the COVID-19 
pandemic, particularly among urban agencies. Of greatest concern are the declines in 
patient census, which drastically affect agency revenue, and the shortages of PPE and 
disinfectants. Without proper protection, HHA clinicians are at r isk of self-exposure and viral 
transmission to patients and vulnerable family members.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

BACKGROUNDNursing homes provide long-term care and have residential-oriented 
hospitalizations characterized by medical, nursing, and social-care treatments for a typically 
geriatric population. In the current emergency phase, the problem of infections in residential 
structures for the elderly is taking on considerable importance in relation to the significant 
prevalence rates of COVID-19.SAFETY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIESPrevention and 
control measures for SARS-CoV-2 infection in nursing homes should be planned before a 
possible outbreak of COVID-19 occurs and should be intensified during any exacerbation of 
the same. Each facility should identify a properly trained contact person-also external-for 
the prevention and control of infections, who can refer to a multidisciplinary support 
committee and who is in close contact with the local health authorities. The contact person 
should collaborate with professionals in order to prepare a prevention and intervention plan 
that considers national provisions and scientific evidence, the requirements for reporting 
patients with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, the indications for the management of 
suspected, probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19.DISCUSSIONAdequate risk 
management in residential structures implies the establishment of a coordination committee 
with dedicated staff, the implementation of a surveillance program for the rapid recognition 
of the outbreaks, the identification of suitable premises and equipment, the application of 
universal precautions, the adaptation of care plans to reduce the possibility of contagion 
among residents, the protection of operators and staff training initiatives.

6. Experiences of Home Health Care Workers in New York City during the Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Qualitative Analysis 
Sterling M.R. JAMA Internal Medicine 2020;:No page numbers.  

Importance: Home health care workers care for community-dwelling adults and play an 
important role in supporting patients with confirmed and suspected coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) who remain at home. These workers are mostly middle-aged women and 
racial/ethnic minorities who typically earn low wages. Despite being integral to patient care, 
these workers are often neglected by the medical community and society at large; thus, 
developing a health care system capable of addressing the COVID-19 crisis and future 
pandemics requires a better understanding of the experiences of home health care 
workers. <br/>Objective(s): To understand the experiences of home health care workers 
caring for patients in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>Design, Setting, 
and Participant(s): From March to April 2020, a qualitative study with 1-to-1 semistructured 
interviews of 33 home health care workers in New York City was conducted in partnership 
with the 1199SEIU Home Care Industry Education Fund, a benefit fund of the 1199 Service 
Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East, the largest heal th care 
union in the US. Purposeful sampling was used to identify and recruit home health care 
workers. <br/>Main Outcomes and Measures: Audio-recorded interviews were 
professionally transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Major themes and 
subthemes were identified. <br/>Result(s): In total, 33 home health care workers employed 
by 24 unique home care agencies across the 5 boroughs of New York City participated. 
Participants had a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.0) years, 32 (97%) were women, 21 (64%) 
were Black participants, and 6 (18%) were Hispanic participants. Five major themes 
emerged: home health care workers (1) were on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic

7. Fabry disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. Why and how treatment should be 
continued. 
Politei Juan Molecular genetics and metabolism 2020;130(4):227-229.  

Fabry disease is an X-linked disease due to a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-
galactosidase A. Clinical symptoms in classically affected males include acroparesthesia, 
anhydrosis and angiokeratoma, which may present during childhood followed by cardiac, 
cerebral and renal complications. Even though pulmonary involvement is not widely 
appreciated by clinicians, an obstructive lung disease is another recognized component of 
Fabry disease. Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus was 
labeled as a global pandemic and patients with Fabry disease can be considered at high 
risk of developing severe complications. The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Fabry 
disease receiving enzyme replacement therapy is still unknown. Many patients who receive 
treatment in the hospital experienced infusion disruptions due to fear of infection. Effects of 
temporary treatment interruption was described in more detail in other lysosomal storage 
diseases, but the recommencement of therapy does not fully reverse clinical decline due to 
the temporary discontinuation. When possible, home-therapy seems to be the most efficient 
way to maintain enzyme replacement therapy access during pandemic. Sentence take-
home message: Home-therapy, when possible, seems to be the most efficient way to 
maintain enzyme replacement therapy access during pandemic in patients with Fabry 
disease.

8. Health and Economic Outcomes of Home Maintenance Allergen Immunotherapy in 
Select Patients with High Health Literacy during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cost-
Effectiveness Analysis During Exceptional Times 
Shaker M.S. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice 2020;8(7):2310.  

Background: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is safe and effective but is typically 
administered under strict clinic observation to mitigate the risk of a systemic reaction to 
immunotherapy (SRIT). However, in the setting of the global coronavirus disease 2019 
pandemic, alternative care models should be explored. <br/>Objective(s): To evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized 
circumstance for provision of maintenance AIT in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of 
unforeseen reduction in nonessential medical services. <br/>Method(s): Markov modeling 
was used to compare in-office clinic AIT in selected patients using cohort analysis and

microsimulation from the societal and health care perspectives. <br/>Result(s): Assuming 
similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio of $44,554/quality-adjusted life-year when considering both incremental 
epinephrine autoinjector costs and coronavirus disease 2019 risks. Excluding epinephrine 
autoinjector costs, HISTA dominated other options. However, outside of pandemic 
considerations, HITSA was not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, 
$198,877,286) at annual epinephrine autoinjector costs above $287. As the incremental 
HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. 
Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip 
clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies. Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective 
option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting 
coronavirus disease 2019. <br/>Conclusion(s): Under idealized assumptions HITSA can be 
a safe and cost-effective option during a global pandemic in appropriately selected patients 
provided home rates of SRIT remain stable.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

9. Home Care for Cancer Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Double Triage 
Protocol 
Porzio G. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management 2020;60(1):No page numbers.  

Patients with cancer have an increased risk of developing severe forms of coronavirus 
disease 2019, and patients with advanced cancer who are followed at home represent a 
particularly frail population. Although with substantial differences, the challenges that  
cancer care professionals have to face during a pandemic are quite similar to those posed 
by natural disasters. We have already managed the oncological home care service in 
L'Aquila (middle Italy) after the 2009 earthquake. With this letter, we want to share the 
procedures and tools that we have started using at the home care service of the Tuscany 
Tumor Association during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.<br/>Copyright &#xa9;

10. Home medical nutrition during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - A position paper. 
Matras Przemyslaw Clinical nutrition ESPEN 2020;38:196-200.  

BACKGROUNDThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the 
cause of a worldwide rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 
Patients fed enterally and parenterally at home are exposed to the same risk of infection  as 
the general population, but more prone to complications than others. Therefore the 
guidance for care-givers and care-takers of these patients is needed.METHODSThe 
literature search identified no relevant systematic reviews or studies on the subject. 
Therefore a panel of 21 experts from 13 home medical nutrition (HMN) centres in Poland 
was formed. Twenty-three key issues relevant to the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
or COVID-19 in the HMN settings were identified and discussed. Some statements diverge 
from the available nutrition, surgical or ICU guidelines, some are based on the best 
available experience. Each topic was discussed and assessed during two Delphi rounds

11. Home monitoring for COVID-19 
Medina M. Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine 2020;:No page numbers.  

Cleveland Clinic recognized the importance of mitigating community transmission of 
COVID-19 by keeping people at home. Patient-care activities quickly pivoted to remote 
touches, preserving continuity through a variety of digital and telephonic modalities. As the 
number of confirmed cases grew, standardizing home-based care became critical to 
managing high-risk patients, moderating the risk of exposure for healthcare workers, and 
reducing the amount of community spread through appropriate education on home-based 
care for exposed or infected individuals. This novel, team-based approach to caring for 
patients with COVID-19 incorporates a self-monitoring app for patient engagement, 
monitors symptoms for early intervention, and promotes a holistic view of 
care.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 The Cleveland Clinic Foundation. All Rights Reserved.

12. Home-based Testing for SARS-CoV-2: Leveraging Prehospital Resources for 
Vulnerable Populations. 
Goldberg Scott A. The western journal of emergency medicine 2020;21(4):813-816.  

INTRODUCTIONExpanded testing for SARS-CoV-2 is critical to characterizing the extent of 
community spread of COVID-19 and to identifying infectious cohorts. Unfortunately, current 
facility-based testing compounds shortcomings in testing availability, neglecting those who 
are frail or physically unable to travel to a testing facility.METHODSWe developed an 
emergency medical service (EMS)-based home testing and evaluation program, leveraging 
existing community EMS resources. This program has kept vulnerable populations out of 
the emergency department, reduced cost, and improved access to care.RESULTSOur 
EMS-based testing program can test approximately 15 homebound patients per day. 
Through April 2020 our program had performed 477 home-based tests. Additionally, we 
have recently undertaken several mass testing operations, testing up to 900 patients per 
testing site.CONCLUSIONFacility-based SARS-CoV-2 testing requires that a patient 
physically present to a facility for a nasopharyngeal swap to be collected. Unfortunately, 
access may be limited for patients that are homebound, chronically i ll, or without a means 
of private transportation. By leveraging existing EMS infrastructure in new ways, our 
community has been able to keep almost 500 vulnerable patients in their home. Using 
EMS, we can strengthen the healthcare system's response to the evolving COVID-19 
pandemic and support at-risk populations, including those that are underserved, 
homebound, and frail.

13. Impact of home quarantine on physical activity among older adults living at home 
during the COVID-19 pandemic: Qualitative interview study 
Goethals L. Journal of Medical Internet Research 2020;22(5):No page numbers.  

Background: Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death 
from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). In this period of 
quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as 
the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far 
more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they 
have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary 
lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of 
independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, 
as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. <br/>Objective(s): Our first objective 
was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on 
the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss 
alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to 
avoid a sedentary lifestyle. <br/>Method(s): We conducted a qualitative survey using 
semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity 
programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) 
from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) 
and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a 
common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. 
<br/>Result(s): This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before 
quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity  programs in 
the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group 
physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform 
physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe 
ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for 
physical activity at home appears essential in this context. <br/>Conclusion(s): Given the 
results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for 
older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of 
independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is 
no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.<br/>Copyright

Families and intergenerational relationships are important sources of risk for COVID-19 
infection, especially for older adults who are at high r isk of complications from the disease. 
If one family member is exposed to the virus they could serve as a source of transmission 
or, if they fall ill, the resources they provide to others could be severed. These risks may be 
especially heightened for family members who work outside the home and provide care, or 
for those family members who care for multiple generations. Policies have the potential to 
help families bear the burden of these decisions. This essay argues that policies that 
address health, employment, and other social issues have implications for families, and that 
policies aimed at families and caregivers can affect the health, employment, and the 
general well-being of the nation.

15. Keeping people with epilepsy safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
French Jacqueline A. Neurology 2020;94(23):1032-1037.  

OBJECTIVESTo provide information on the effect of the coronavirus disease of 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic on people with epilepsy and provide consensus recommendations 
on how to provide the best possible care for people with epilepsy while avoiding visits to 
urgent care facilities and hospitalizations during the novel coronavirus 
pandemic.METHODSThe authors developed consensus statements in 2 sections. The first 
was "How should we/clinicians modify our clinical care pathway for people with epilepsy 
during the COVID-19 pandemic?" The second was "What general advice should we give to 
people with epilepsy during this crisis? The authors individually scored statements on a 
scale of -10 (strongly disagree) to +10 (strongly agree). Five of 11 recommendations for 
physicians and 3/5 recommendations for individuals/families were rated by all the authors 
as 7 or above (strongly agree) on the first round of rating. Subsequently, a teleconference 
was held where statements for which there was a lack of strong consensus were 
revised.RESULTSAfter revision, all consensus recommendations received a score of 7 or 
above. The recommendations focus on administration of as much care as possible at home 
to keep people with epilepsy out of health care facilities, where they are likely to  encounter 
COVID-19 (including strategies for rescue therapy), as well as minimization of risk of 
seizure exacerbation through adherence, and through ensuring a regular supply of 
medication. We also provide helpful links to additional helpful information for people with 
epilepsy and health providers.CONCLUSIONThese recommendations may help health care 
professionals provide optimal care to people with epilepsy during the coronavirus 
pandemic.

regard, particularly for patients with sleep-disordered breathing at home and during hospital 
admission. Aerosols are produced, at home and in health care facilities, by natural 
processes and aerosol-generating procedures. To address this impinging problem, aerosol-
generating procedures, like non-invasive ventilation (NIV), are to be handled meticulously, 
which might warrant isolation and sometimes device/interface modifications.

17. Management Strategies for People Experiencing Sheltered Homelessness during the 
COVID-19 Pandemic: Clinical Outcomes and Costs. 
Freedberg Kenneth A. medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences 2020;:No page 
numbers.  

IMPORTANCEApproximately 356,000 people stay in homeless shelters nightly in the US. 
These individuals are at high risk for COVID-19.OBJECTIVETo assess clinical outcomes, 
costs, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for COVID-19 prevention and management 
among sheltered homeless adults.DESIGNWe developed a dynamic microsimulation model 
of COVID-19. We modeled sheltered homeless adults in Boston, Massachusetts, using 
cohort characteristics and costs from Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. 
Disease progression, transmission, and clinical outcomes data were from published 
literature and national databases. We examined surging, growing, and slowing epidemics 
(effective reproduction numbers [Re] 2.6, 1.3, and 0.9). Costs were from a health care 
sector perspective; time horizon was 4 months.SETTING & PARTICIPANTSSimulated 
cohort of 2,258 adults residing in homeless shelters in Boston.INTERVENTIONSWe 
assessed combinations of daily symptom screening with same-day polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) testing of screen-positive individuals, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, 
hospital-based COVID-19 care, alternate care sites [ACSs] for mild/moderate COVID-19 
management, and moving people from shelters to temporary housing, compared to no 
intervention.MAIN OUTCOMESInfections, hospital-days, costs, and cost-
effectiveness.RESULTSCompared to no intervention, daily symptom screening with ACSs 
for those with pending tests or confirmed COVID-19 and mild/moderate disease leads to 
37% fewer infections and 46% lower costs when Re=2.6, 75% fewer infections and 72% 
lower costs when Re=1.3, and 51% fewer infections and 51% lower costs when Re=0.9. 
Adding universal PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreases infections in all epidemic 
scenarios, with incremental cost per case prevented of $1,000 (Re=2.6),  $27,000 (Re=1.3), 
and $71,000 (Re=0.9). In all scenarios, moving shelter residents to temporary housing with 
universal PCR testing every 2 weeks is most effective but substantially more costly than 
other options. Results are most sensitive to the cost and sensitivity of PCR testing and the 
efficacy of ACSs in preventing transmission. Conclusions & Relevance: Daily symptom 
screening and ACSs for sheltered homeless adults will substantially decrease COVID-19 
cases and reduce costs compared to no intervention. In a surging epidemic, adding 
universal PCR testing every 2 weeks further decreases cases at modest incremental cost 
and should be considered.

The characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have primarily 
been described in hospitalized adults. Characterization of COVID-19 in ambulatory care is 
needed for a better understanding of its evolving epidemiology. Our aim is to provide a 
description of the demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and social factors in 
confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive non-hospitalized adults. We conducted a retrospective 
medical record review of 208 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive patients treated in a COVID-
19 virtual outpatient management clinic established in an academic health system in 
Georgia. The mean age was 47.8 (range 21-88) and 69.2% were female. By race/ethnicity, 
49.5% were non-Hispanic African American, 25.5% other/unknown, 22.6% non-Hispanic 
white, and 2.4% Hispanic. Nearly 70% had at least one preexisting medical condition. The 
most common presenting symptoms were cough (75.5%), loss of smell or taste (63%), 
headache (62%), and body aches (54.3%). Physician or advanced practice provider 
assessed symptom severity ranged from 51.9% mild, 30.3% moderate, and 1.4% severe. 
Only eight reported limitations to home care (3.8%), 55.3% had a caregiver available, and 
93.3% reported initiating self-isolation. Care needs were met for 83.2%. Our results suggest 
the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 illness in non-hospitalized adults 
differ considerably from hospitalized patients and warrant greater awareness of risk among 
younger and healthier individuals and consideration of testing and recommending self-
isolation for a wider spectrum of clinical symptoms by clinicians. Social factors may also 
influence the efficacy of preventive strategies and allocation of resources toward the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

19. Pulse Oximetry for Monitoring Patients with COVID-19 at Home: Potential Pitfalls and 
Practical Guidance. 
Luks Andrew M. Annals of the American Thoracic Society 2020;:No page numbers.  

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, reports in social media and the lay press indicate 
that a subset of patients are presenting with severe hypoxemia in the absence of dyspnea, 
a problem unofficially referred to as "silent hypoxemia." To decrease the risk of 
complications in such patients, one proposed solution has been to have those diagnosed 
with COVID-19 but not sick enough to warrant admission monitor their arterial oxygenation 
by pulse oximetry at home and present for care when they show evidence of hypoxemia. 
While the ease of use and low cost of pulse oximetry makes this an attractive option for 
identifying problems at an early stage, there are important considerations with pulse 
oximetry about which patients and providers may not be aware that can interfere with 
successful implementation of such monitoring programs. Only a few independent studies 
have examined the performance of pocket oximeters and smart phone-based systems but 
the limited available data raise questions about their accuracy, particularly as saturation 
falls below 90%. There are also multiple sources of error in pulse oximetry that must be 
accounted for including rapid fluctuations in measurements when the PaO2 falls on the 
steep portion of the dissociation curve, data acquisition problems when pulsatile blood flow 
is diminished, accuracy in the setting of severe hypoxemia, dyshemoglobinemias and other 
problems. Recognition of these issues and careful counseling of patients about the proper 
means for measuring their oxygen saturation and when to seek assistance can help ensure 
successful implementation of needed monitoring programs.

20. Report of five nurses infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
during patient care: case series. 
Gheysarzadeh A. New microbes and new infections 2020;36:100694.  

The high prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has received much attention 
all over the world. Nurses are in the first line of defence against severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and are placed in a high-risk situation. This study 
aimed to report on infection with SARS-CoV-2 during patient care among nures in the 
Mostafa Khomini Hospital, Ilam, Iran. In this hospital 125 nurses were enrolled in the 
COVID-19 centre. Five out of 125 nurses (4%) who enrolled in the COVID-19 infection 
centre, developed COVID-19. They were first positive by real-time PCR but the CT scan 
was positive for only one of them. None of the infected nurses were hospitalized and all of 
them preferred to quarantine at home and receive the necessary care and treatment 
(oseltamivir, azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir). This study showed that, regardless of self 
caring, the nurses were exposed to the virus, because at the start of the SARS-CoV-2 
outbreak in Iran, there was no special protection against this infection, so the nurses were 
placed at risk. This study also reported that receiving the necessary care and treatment at 
home was a good experience for nurses and can be used in some cases.

21. Review of Burden, Clinical Definitions, and Management of COVID-19 Cases. 
McArthur Laura The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene 2020;103(2):625 -
638.  

Our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), its clinical manifestations, and treatment options continues to evolve at an 
unparalleled pace. This review sought to summarize the key literature regarding 
transmission, case definitions, clinical management, and the burden of COVID-19. Our 
review of the literature showed that SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted via inhalation of 
respiratory droplets containing the virus and had a mean incubation period of 4 -6 days. The 
commonly reported symptoms were fever (75.3% ± 18.7%) and cough (62.6% ± 17.7%) 
across the spectrum of clinical disease-mild, moderate, severe, and critical, but with the 
disease phenotype varying with severity. Categorization of these cases for home care or 
hospital management needs to be defined, with risk stratification accounting for the age of 
the patient and the presence of underlying comorbidities. The case definitions varied 
among countries, which could have contributed to the differences in the case fatality rates 
among affected countries. The severity and risk of death due to COVID-19 was associated 
with age and underlying comorbidities. Asymptomatic cases, which constitute 40-80% of 
COVID-19 cases are a considerable threat to control efforts. The presence of fever and 
cough may be sufficient to warrant COVID-19 testing, but using these symptoms in isolation 
will miss a proportion of cases. A clear definition of a COVID-19 case is essential for the 
management, treatment, and tracking of clinical illness, and to inform the quarantine 
measures and social distancing that can help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

22. The effect of social distance measures on COVID-19 epidemics in Europe: an 
interrupted time series analysis. 
Vokó Zoltán GeroScience 2020;42(4):1075-1082.  

Following the introduction of unprecedented "stay-at-home" national policies, the COVID-19 
pandemic recently started declining in Europe. Our research aims were to characterize the 
changepoint in the flow of the COVID-19 epidemic in each European country and to 
evaluate the association of the level of social distancing with the observed decline in the 
national epidemics. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted in 28 European 
countries. Social distance index was calculated based on Google Community Mobility 
Reports. Changepoints were estimated by threshold regression, national findings were 
analyzed by Poisson regression, and the effect of social distancing in mixed effects Poisson 
regression model. Our findings identified the most probable changepoints in 28 European 
countries. Before changepoint, incidence of new COVID-19 cases grew by 24% per day on 
average. From the changepoint, this growth rate was reduced to 0.9%, 0.3% increase, and 
to 0.7% and 1.7% decrease by increasing social distancing quartiles. The beneficial effect 
of higher social distance quartiles (i.e., turning the increase into decline) was statistically 
significant for the fourth quartile. Notably, many countries in lower quartiles also achieved a 
flat epidemic curve. In these countries, other plausible COVID-19 containment measures 
could contribute to controlling the first wave of the disease. The association of social 
distance quartiles with viral spread could also be hindered by local bottlenecks in infection 
control. Our results allow for moderate optimism related to the gradual lifting of social 
distance measures in the general population, and call for specific attention to the protection 
of focal micro-societies enriching high-risk elderly subjects, including nursing homes and 
chronic care facilities.

23. The Hydra-Headed Coronaviruses: Implications of COVID-19 for Homeopathy 
Waisse S. Homeopathy 2020;:No page numbers.  

Successful homeopathic prescriptions are based on careful individualization of symptoms, 
either for an individual patient or collectively in the case of epidemic outbreaks. The 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was initially represented as a severe acute respiratory illness, 
with eventual dramatic complications. However, over time it revealed to be a complex 
systemic disease with manifestations derived from viral-induced inflammation and 
hypercoagulability, thus liable to affect any body organ or system. As a result, clinical 
presentation is variable, in addition to variations associated with several individual and 
collective risk factors. Given the extreme variability of pathology and clinical manifestations, 
a single, or a few, universal homeopathic preventive Do not split medicine(s) do not seem 
feasible. Yet homeopathy may have a relevant role to play, inasmuch as the vast majority 
of patients only exhibit the mild form of disease and are indicated to self-care at home, 
without standard monitoring, follow-up, or treatment. For future pandemics, homeopathy 
agencies should prepare by establishing rapid-response teams and efficacious lines of 
communication.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

24. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emotional well-being and home 
treatment of Belgian patients with cystic fibrosis, including transplanted patients and 
paediatric patients 
Havermans T. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis 2020;:No page numbers.  

Background: Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cystic fibrosis 
(CF), despite being considered a high-risk group. This study explored the early impact of 
COVID-19 on the emotional well-being of patients and self-reported changes in their home 
therapy since the start of the pandemic. <br/>Method(s): Adult patients with CF, lung-
transplanted (LTX) CF patients and parents of children with CF completed an online 
questionnaire, securely linked to their medical files. The questionnaire covered the 
emotional impact of the pandemic, changes in CF and LTX treatment, changes in health-
protecting behaviours and CF-related concerns, and their perception of their COVID-19 
status. <br/>Result(s): The response rate was 63% (80 CF, 66 LTX and 73 parents). A wide 
range of illness severity was included. None of the respondents had contracted COVID-19 
and all strictly followed the social distancing rules. There was evident psychological impact, 
with many reporting increased stress, fear and worry about CF and the future. Changes in 
treatment were positive, including more physiotherapy for adults and better-quality 
nebulizing. Changes in routine were reported, such as different treatment timing. Adult 
patients and parents had cancelled their CF appointments more often since the start of the 
pandemic. <br/>Conclusion(s): The initial psychological impact of COVID-19 was evident. 
The impact on home treatment was reassuringly small. Psychological care is needed for 
patients suffering prolonged psychological impact, and CF teams need to contextualize the 
information that patients and parents receive from the media and support them to balance 
the perceived risk with true risk.<br/>Copyright &#xa9; 2020

25. The invisible workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic: Family carers at the 
frontline. 
Phillips Dominique HRB open research 2020;3:24.  

This is an open letter to acknowledge the essential and increasingly challenging role unpaid 
family carers are playing in the COVID-19 pandemic. The letter is written by members of 
the CAREWELL team, a HRB-funded project that aims to promote health and self-care 
behaviours among working family carers. Family carers provide care to family and friends in 
the community who need support due to old-age, disability and chronic illness. In many 
cases, family carers are supporting those who are considered most at risk in this pandemic 
meaning carers must reduce their own risk of infection in order to protect their dependent 
family members. The temporary reduction of some home care services, as well as school 
and creche closures, means that family carers are providing increased levels of care with 
little or no support. At a time when both worlds of work and care have been dramatically 
transformed, we wish to shed light on those who are currently balancing paid employment 
with a family caregiving role. We argue that there is much to be learned from the recent 
work restrictions that could benefit employees, including working family carers, beyond this 
pandemic. We also wish to build on the potential positives of a transformed society and 
encourage policy makers and employers to focus on what is currently being implemented, 
and to identify which measures could be used to create a bedrock of policies and practices 
that would offer robust and effective support to family carers. It is hoped that family carers 
will receive greater recognition for the significant role they play in society, providing 
essential care and alleviating the strain on health and social care systems, both during and 
post the COVID-19 pandemic.

26. Transmission and risk factors of OF COVID-19. 
Miller Ryan Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine 2020;:No page numbers.  

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is transmitted through respiratory secretions 
and saliva. The virus can also live for short periods of time (1 to several hours) on fomites 
such as doorknobs, handrails, and tables. Aerosolization of the virus can occur during 
procedures including bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and administration of 
nebulized treatments. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus does occur and may account for 
up to 60% of cases. Risk factors for a more severe course of COVID-19 include age 65 and 
older, living in a nursing home or long term care facility, chronic lung disease, and others.

27. Treating Hematologic Malignancies During a Pandemic: Utilizing Telehealth and 
Digital Technology to Optimize Care. 
Binder Adam F. Frontiers in oncology 2020;10:1183.  

In late January 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) 
was reported as an outbreak in Wuhan, China. Within 2 months it became a global 
pandemic. Patients with cancer are at highest risk for both contracting and suffering 
complications of its resultant disease, Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). Healthcare systems 
across the world had to adapt quickly to mitigate this risk, while continuing to provide 
potentially lifesaving treatment to patients. Bringing care to the home through the use of 
telehealth, home based chemotherapy, and remote patient monitoring technologies can 
help minimize risk to the patient and healthcare workers without sacrificing quality of care 
delivered. These care models provide the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right 
time, in the right place. Whether these patient-centered models of care will continue to be 
embraced by key stakeholders after the pandemic remains uncertain.

28. Urgent need for individual mobile phone and institutional reporting of at home, 
hospitalized, and intensive care unit cases of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. 
McCullough Peter A. Reviews in cardiovascular medicine 2020;21(1):1-7.  

Approximately 90 days of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) spreading originally from Wuhan, 
China, and across the globe has led to a widespread chain of events with imminent threats 
to the fragile relationship between community health and economic health. Despite near 
hourly reporting on this crisis, there has been no regular, updated, or accurate reporting of 
hospitalizations for COVID-19. It is known that many test-positive individuals may not 
develop symptoms or have a mild self-limited viral syndrome consisting of fever, malaise, 
dry cough, and constitutional symptoms. However some individuals develop a more 
fulminant syndrome including viral pneumonia, respiratory failure requiring oxygen, acute 
respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation, and in substantial fractions 
leading to death attributable to COVID-19. The pandemic is evolving in a clustered, non-

inform fashion resulting in many hospitals with preparedness but few or no cases, and 
others that are completely overwhelmed. Thus, a considerable risk of spread when 
personal protection equipment becomes exhausted and a large fraction of mortality in those 
not offered mechanical ventilation are both attributable to a crisis due to maldistribu tion of 
resources. The pandemic is amenable to self-reporting through a mobile phone application 
that could obtain critical information on suspected cases and report on the results of self 
testing and actions taken. The only method to understand the clustering and the immediate 
hospital resource needs is mandatory, uniform, daily reporting of hospital censuses of 
COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital wards and intensive care units. Current reports of 
hospitalizations are delayed, uncertain, and wholly inadequate. This paper urges all the 
relevant stakeholders to take up self-reporting and reporting of hospitalizations of COVID-
19 as an urgent task in combating this devastating pandemic.

29. Using Telemedicine and Infographics for Physician-Guided Home Drain Removal. 
Go Beatrice C. OTO open 2020;4(2):2473974X20933566.  

ObjectiveMeasures to decrease hospital length of stay and outpatient visits are crucial 
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Physician-guided home drain 
removal presents a potential opportunity for mitigating viral spread and 
transmission.MethodsA prospective case series on patients undergoing major head and 
neck surgery with Jackson-Pratt drain placement was conducted. Patients were shown an 
infographic detailing drain care and removal at preoperative assessment and prior to 
discharge. At a 1-week follow-up telemedicine visit, patients were instructed to remove the 
drain under physician guidance. Patients were assessed 7 days after to determine 
complication rate and satisfaction.ResultsTwenty-five patients were enrolled with 100% 
patients undergoing successful drain removal at home with caregiver support. There were 
no complications reported at the 7-day postdrain removal time point, and overall patient 
satisfaction was high.DiscussionInfographics and telemedicine are 2 synergistic strategies 
to guide safe and effective home drain removal.Implications for PracticeThis study 
demonstrates how telemedicine and an infographic can be effectively used in physician -
guided home drain removal. During a time like the COVID-19 pandemic, innovative 
measures are necessary to curb transmission and infection rates. We propose a unique 
and replicable yet safe solution to limit unnecessary exposure and encourage other surgical 
providers to adopt a similar strategy.

30. Video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older people: A rapid 
review 
Noone C. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2020;5:1-40.  

Background The current COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a possible trigger for 
increases in loneliness and social isolation among older people due to the restrictions on 
movement that many countries have put in place. Loneliness and social isolation are 
consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people.

Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the 
participant's social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing 
acquaintances. Objectives The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the 
effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The 
review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of 
depression and improving quality of life. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, 
MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched 
the references of relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria Randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We 
excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean 
age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they 
were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline. Any intervention 
in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video 
conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing 
loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included 
studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, 
symptoms of depression or quality of life. Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a 
third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining 
abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved 
conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process 
for full-text articles. Data collection and analysis One review author extracted data, which 
another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation 
and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review 
author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE 
approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-eKect meta-
analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of 
depression. Main results We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together 
included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual 
care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores 
range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and 
suggests that video calls may result in little to no diKerence in scores on the UCLA 
Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean diKerence (MD) -0.44, 
95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -
0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% 
CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by 
three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies 
reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression 
using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The 
evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no 
diKerence in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three 
months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six 
months' follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The 
evidence suggests that video calls may have a small eKect on symptoms of depression at 
one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 
study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for 
study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, 
reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of 
the Short- Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that 
measure diKerent aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; 
social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health. Each subscale is scored 
from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that 
there may be little to no diKerence between people allocated to usual care and those 
allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01

31. Vitamin D can be effective on the prevention of COVID-19 complications: A narrative 
review on molecular aspects 
Shiravi A.-A. International journal for vitamin and nutrition research. Internationale 
Zeitschrift fur Vitamin- und Ernahrungsforschung. Journal international de vitaminologie et 
de nutrition 2020;:1-13.  

The widespread COVID-19 pandemic has been, currently, converted to a catastrophic 
human health challenge. Vitamin D (VD) and its metabolites have been used as a palliative 
treatment for chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases from ancient times. In the 
current study, some molecular aspects of the potential effects of VD against COVID-19 
side-effects have been discussed. An arguable role in autophagy or apoptosis control has 
been suggested for VD through calcium signaling at the mitochondrial and ER levels. 
1,25(OH)2D3 is also an immunomodulator that affects the development of B-cells, T-cells, 
and NK cells in both innate and acquired immunity. The production of some anti-microbial 
molecules such as defensins and cathelicidins is also stimulated by VD. The 
overexpression of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, and 
down-regulation of NADPH oxidase are induced by VD to reduce the oxidative stress. 
Moreover, the multi-organ failure due to a cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV2 in 
COVID-19 may be prevented by the immunomodulatory effects of VD. It can also 
downregulate the renin-angiotensin system which has a protective role against 
cardiovascular complications induced by COVID-19. Given the many experimental and 
molecular evidences due to the potential protective effects of VD on the prevention of the 
COVID-19-induced morbidities, a VD supplementation is suggested to prevent the lethal 
side-effects of the infection. It is particularly recommended in VD-deficient patients or those 
at greater risk of serious or critical effects of COVID-19, including the elderly, and patients 
with pre-existing chronic diseases, especially those in nursing homes, care facilities, and 
hospitals. 

   

32. [COVID-19: care at home or in hospital? Considerations in primary care]. 
Harskamp R. E Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde 2020;164:No page numbers.  

COVID-19 is a treacherous disease, in which infected patients who appear to fare well can 
deteriorate rapidly, mostly due to respiratory failure. For general practitioners (and other 
first-line responders), a clinical evaluation at any given time merely provides a snapshot of 
the patient's condition. Therefore, frequent monitoring is warranted in at-risk patients. 
However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach for monitoring, treatment and referral 
decisions. This is particularly the case in patients with advanced age. In this article, through 
the use of case examples, we aim to provide guidance when facing difficult management 
decisions in patients with (suspected) COVID-19.

33. [Ethical approach to the issue of confinement of the elderly in the context of the 
COVID-19 pandemic: Prevention of frailty versus risk of vulnerability]. 
Piccoli M. Ethics, medicine, and public health 2020;14:100539.  

COVID-19 pandemic particularly affects older people and exposes them to a higher risk of 
mortality. Containment, social distancing and isolation measures have been implemented to 
limit viral transmission. While there is a clear rationale for reducing the contagiousness of 
the infection through this means, the adverse consequences of this social isolation, 
especially for this heterogeneous, aged and frail people, are difficult  to apprehend. In 
particular, the disruption of the usual support and care ecosystems at home or in 
institutions may paradoxically increase the frailty of these people and lead to adverse 
events we wanted to avoid. On the other hand, the risk of a decrease in the older person's 
empowerment regarding his or her own health and social life decisions requires particular 
vigilance to prevent the risk of societal ageism. Regarding this population in particular, a 
possible conflict of values between individual and collective protection on one hand and 
respect for autonomy and independence on the other hand could exist. This article 
proposes an ethical reflection on the issue of containment of frail ageing people, based on 
medical ethics principles, in order to open up positive approaches of vulnerability that 
guarantee respect for the dignity of the person and equity in care access.

34. [HOME CARE AND COVID-19. BEFORE, IN AND AFTER THE STATE OF ALARM]. 
Ramón Martínez Riera José Enfermeria clinica 2020;:No page numbers.  

In Spain, Home Care as a fundamental tool of Primary Health Care, has had uneven 
development both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, although it initially played a 
relevant role in the control and monitoring of infected people and their families. However, at 
no time it was used the desirable community perspective and community participation 
throughout the process as it has been successfully done in other settings. Subsequently, 
with the closure of health centers, it ceased to be provided in some autonomous 
communities, when all the attention was transferred to the hospital setting. This 
exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high 
contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, 
where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear 
risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the 
care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD 
...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions 
for infection for professionals, family and caregivers. This can be adapted to the pandemic 
situation by using tools that digital health offers (telephone care, video calls ...). Finally, it 
would be very interesting that, once the crisis was over, research was carried out that 
allowed the incorporation of people who have been treated by the health service during the 
pandemic, through the technique called public participation in research projects.

We report on the protocol adopted by the Oncological Home Care Service of the Tuscany 
Cancer Association during the CoViD-19 pandemic. Based on the experience in home 
cancer care gained during the 2009 earthquake, we have developed strategies to ensure 
continuity of care, non-abandonment and protection of operators. In this context, the double 
triage protocol plays a central role, aimed at identifying patients at risk for CoViD-19 
infection and rationalizing home access. we describe the protocol and present the 
preliminary data.
