We report on the protocol adopted by the Oncological Home Care Service of the Tuscany 
Cancer Association during the CoViD-19 pandemic. Based on the experience in home 
cancer care gained during the 2009 earthquake, we have developed strategies to ensure 
continuity of care, non-abandonment and protection of operators. In this context, the double 
triage protocol plays a central role, aimed at identifying patients at risk for CoViD-19 
infection and rationalizing home access. we describe the protocol and present the 
preliminary data.
