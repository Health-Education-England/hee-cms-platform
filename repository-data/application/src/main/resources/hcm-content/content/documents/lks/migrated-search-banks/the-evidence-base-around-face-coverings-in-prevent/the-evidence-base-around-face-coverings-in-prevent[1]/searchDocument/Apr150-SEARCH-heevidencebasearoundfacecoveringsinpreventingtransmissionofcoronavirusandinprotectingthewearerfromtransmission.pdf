Quarantine alone or in combination with other public health measures to control COVID ‐19: 
a rapid review (2020)  

Nussbaumer-Streit, B et.al  

Available online at this link  

Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a rapidly emerging disease that has been 
classified a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). To support WHO with their 
recommendations on quarantine, we conducted a rapid review on the effectiveness of quarantine 
during severe coronavirus outbreaks. Objectives We conducted a rapid review to assess the 
effects of quarantine (alone or in combination with other measures) of individuals who had contact 

with confirmed cases of COVID‐19, who travelled from countries with a declared outbreak, or who 
live in regions with high transmission of the disease. Search methods An information specialist 
searched PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, WHO Global Index Medicus, Embase, and CINAHL on 12 
February 2020 and updated the search on 12 March 2020. WHO provided records from daily 

searches in Chinese databases up to 16 March 2020. Selection criteria Cohort studies, case ‐
control‐studies, case series, time series, interrupted time series, and mathematical modelling 
studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine to control COVID‐19. We also included 
studies on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory 
syndrome) as indirect evidence for the current coronavirus outbreak. Data collection and analysis 
Two review authors independently screened 30% of records; a single review author screened the 

remaining 70%. Two review authors screened all potentially relevant full‐text publications 
independently. One review author extracted data and assessed evidence quality with GRADE and 
a second review author checked the assessment. We rated the certainty of evidence for the four 
primary outcomes: incidence, onward transmission, mortality, and resource use. Main results We 

included 29 studies; 10 modelling studies on COVID‐19, four observational studies and 15 
modelling studies on SARS and MERS. Because of the diverse methods of measurement and 

analysis across the outcomes of interest, we could not conduct a meta‐analysis and conducted a 
narrative synthesis. Due to the type of evidence found for this review, GRADE rates the certainty of 
the evidence as low to very low. Modeling studies consistently reported a benefit of the simulated 
quarantine measures, for example, quarantine of people exposed to confirmed or suspected cases 
averted 44% to 81% incident cases and 31% to 63% of deaths compared to no measures based 

on different scenarios (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID‐19, SARS; mortality: 2 
modelling studies on COVID‐19, SARS, low‐certainty evidence). Very low‐certainty evidence 
suggests that the earlier quarantine measures are implemented, the greater the cost savings (2

modelling studies on SARS). Very low‐certainty evidence indicated that the effect of quarantine of 
travellers from a country with a declared outbreak on reducing incidence and deaths was small (2 
modelling studies on SARS). When the models combined quarantine with other prevention and 
control measures, including school closures, travel restrictions and social distancing, the models 
demonstrated a larger effect on the reduction of new cases, transmissions and deaths than 

individual measures alone (incident cases: 4 modelling studies on COVID‐19; onward 
transmission: 2 modelling studies on COVID‐19; mortality: 2 modelling studies on COVID‐19; low‐
certainty evidence). Studies on SARS and MERS were consistent with findings from the studies on 

COVID‐19. Authors' conclusions Current evidence for COVID‐19 is limited to modelling studies that 
make parameter assumptions based on the current, fragmented knowledge. Findings consistently 

indicate that quarantine is important in reducing incidence and mortality during the COVID ‐19 
pandemic. Early implementation of quarantine and combining quarantine with other public health 
measures is important to ensure effectiveness. In order to maintain the best possible balance of 
measures, decision makers must constantly monitor the outbreak situation and the  impact of the 
measures implemented. Testing in representative samples in different settings could help assess 
the true prevalence of infection, and would reduce uncertainty of modelling assumptions. This 

review was commissioned by WHO and supported by Danube‐University‐Krems. Plain language 
summary Does quarantine control coronavirus (COVID‐2019) either alone or in combination with 
other public health measures? Background   Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused 
by a new virus that has spread quickly throughout the world. COVID‐19 spreads easily between 
people who are in close contact, or through coughs and sneezes. Most infected people suffer mild, 

flu‐like symptoms but some become seriously ill and even die.  There is no effective treatment 
or vaccine (a medicine that stops people catching a specific disease) for COVID‐19, so other ways 
of slowing (controlling) its spread are needed. One of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 
recommendations for controlling the disease is quarantine. This means separating healthy people 
from other healthy people, in case they have the virus and could spread it. Other similar 

recommendations include isolation (like quarantine, but for people with COVID‐19 symptoms) and 
social distancing (where people without symptoms keep a distance from each other 

physically).   What did we want to find out?   We wanted to find out whether and how 
effectively quarantine stops COVID‐19 spreading and if it prevents death. We wanted to know if it 
was more effective when combined with other measures, such as closing schools. We also wanted 

to know what it costs.   Study characteristics   COVID‐19 is spreading rapidly, so we needed 
to answer this question as quickly as possible. This meant we shortened some steps of the normal 
Cochrane Review process. Nevertheless, we are confident that these changes do not affect our 

overall conclusions.  We looked for studies that assessed the effect of any type of quarantine, 
anywhere, on the spread and severity of COVID‐19. We also looked for studies that assessed 
quarantine alongside other measures, such as isolation, social distancing, school closures and 

hand hygiene. COVID‐19 is a new disease, so, to find as much evidence as possible, we also 
looked for studies on similar viruses, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and 

MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).  Studies measured the number of COVID‐19, SARS 
or MERS cases, how many people were infected, how quickly the virus spread, how many people 

died, and the costs of quarantine.   Key results  We included 29 studies. Ten studies focused 
on COVID‐19, 15 on SARS, two on SARS plus other viruses, and two on MERS. Most of the 
studies combined existing data to create a model (a simulation) for predicting how events might 
occur over time, for people in different situations (called modelling studies). The COVID‐19 studies 
simulated outbreaks in China, UK, South Korea, and on the cruise ship Diamond Princess. Four 
studies looked back on the effect of quarantine on 178,122 people involved in SARS and MERS 
outbreaks (called ‘cohort’ studies). The remaining studies modelled SARS and MERS 

outbreaks. The modelling studies all found that simulated quarantine measures reduce the 
number of people with the disease and the number of deaths. With quarantine,  estimates showed 
a minimum reduction in the number of people with the disease of 44%, and a maximum reduction 
of 81%. Similarly, with quarantine, estimates of the number of deaths showed a minimum reduction 
of 31%, and a maximum reduction of 63%. Combining quarantine with other measures, such as

closing schools or social distancing, is more effective at reducing the spread of COVID ‐19 than 
quarantine alone. The SARS and MERS studies agreed with the studies on COVID‐19. Two SARS 
modelling studies assessed costs. They found that the costs were lower when quarantine 
measures started earlier. We cannot be completely certain about the evidence we found for 

several reasons. The COVID‐19 studies based their models on limited data and made different 
assumptions about the virus (e.g. how quickly it would spread). The other studies investigated 

SARS and MERS so we could not assume the results would be the same for COVID‐19.   
Conclusion Despite limited evidence, all the studies found quarantine to be important in redu cing 
the number of people infected and the number of deaths. Results showed that quarantine was 
most effective, and cost less, when it was started earlier. Combining quarantine with other 
prevention and control measures had a greater effect than quarantine alone. This review includes 
evidence published up to 12 March 2020.  

 

Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses (2011)  

Jefferson, T. et.al  

Available online at this link  

Background: Viral epidemics or pandemics of acute respiratory infections like influenza or severe 
acute respiratory syndrome pose a global threat. Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be 
insufficient to prevent their spread. Objectives To review the effectiveness of physical interventions 
to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Search methods We searched The 
Cochrane Library , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2010, Issue 3), 
which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to 
October 2010), OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965), EMBASE (1990 to October 2010), CINAHL (1982 to 
October 2010), LILACS (2008 to October 2010), Indian MEDLARS (2008 to October 2010) and 
IMSEAR (2008 to October 2010). Selection criteria In this update, two review authors 
independently applied the inclusion criteria to all identified and retrieved articles and extracted 
data. We scanned 3775 titles, excluded 3560 and retrieved full papers of 215 studies, to include 66 
papers of 67 studies. We included physical interventions (screening at entry ports, isolation, 
quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, hand hygiene) to prevent respiratory 

virus transmission. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohorts, case ‐controls, 
before‐after and time series studies. Data collection and analysis We used a standardised form to 
assess trial eligibility. We assessed RCTs by randomisation method, allocation generation, 

concealment, blinding and follow up. We assessed non‐RCTs for potential confounders and 
classified them as low, medium and high risk of bias. Main results We included 67 studies including 
randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total number of 
participants is not included as the total would be made up of a heterogenous set of observations 
(participant people, observations on participants and countries (object of some studies)). The risk 

of bias for five RCTs and most cluster‐RCTs was high. Observational studies were of mixed 
quality. Only case‐control data were sufficiently homogeneous to allow meta‐analysis. The highest 
quality cluster‐RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, 
such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from 
children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the 

potential for confounding is greater. Nine case‐control studies suggested implementing 
transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus 
epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive 
supportive measures. N95 respirators were non‐inferior to simple surgical masks but more 
expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal

handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global  measures, 

such as screening at entry ports, led to a non‐significant marginal delay in spread. There was 
limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure. 
Authors' conclusions Simple and low‐cost interventions would be useful for reducing transmission 
of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long‐term implementation of some measures assessed 
might be difficult without the threat of an epidemic. Plain language summary Physical interventions 
to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses Although respiratory viruses usually only 
cause minor disease, they can cause epidemics. Approximately 10% to 15% of people worldwide 
contract influenza annually, with attack rates as high as 50% during major epidemics. Global 
pandemic viral infections have been devastating. In 2003 the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) epidemic affected around 8000 people, killed 780 and caused an enormous social and 
economic crisis. In 2006 a new avian H5N1, and in 2009 a new H1N1 'swine' influenza pandemic 
threat, caused global anxiety. Single and potentially expensive measures (particularly the use of 
vaccines or antiviral drugs) may be insufficient to interrupt the spread. Therefore, we searched for 
evidence for the effectiveness of simple physical barriers (such as handwashing or wearing masks) 
in reducing the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses. We included 67 studies 
including randomised controlled trials and observational studies with a mixed risk of bias. A total 
number of participants is not included as the total would be made up of a varied set of 
observations: participant people and observations on participants and countries (the object of 
some studies). Any total figure would therefore be misleading. Respiratory virus spread can be 
reduced by hygienic measures (such as handwashing), especially around younger children. 
Frequent handwashing can also reduce transmission from children to other household members. 
Implementing barriers to transmission, such as isolation, and hygienic measures (wearing masks, 
gloves and gowns) can be effective in containing respiratory virus epidemics or in hospital wards. 
We found no evidence that the more expensive, irritating and uncomfortable N95 respirators were 
superior to simple surgical masks. It is unclear if adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal 
handwashing with soap is more effective. There is insufficient evidence to support screening at 
entry ports and social distancing (spatial separation of at least one metre between those infected 
and those non‐infected) as a method to reduce spread during epidemics.

Absence of Apparent Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from Two Stylists After Exposure at a 
Hair Salon with a Universal Face Covering Policy - Springfield, Missouri (2020)  

Hendrix MJ, Walde C., Findley K., Trotman R.  

Available online at this link  

What is already known about this topic? Consistent and correct use of cloth face coverings is 
recommended to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. What is added by this report? Among 139 
clients exposed to two symptomatic hair stylists with confirmed COVID-19 while both the stylists 
and the clients wore face masks, no symptomatic secondary cases were reported; among 67 
clients tested for SARS-CoV-2, all test results were negative. Adherence to the community’s and 
company’s face-covering policy likely mitigated spread of SARS-CoV-2. What are the implications 
for public health practice? As stay-at-home orders are lifted, professional and social interactions in 
the community will present more opportunities for spread of SARS-CoV-2. Broader implementation 
of face covering policies could mitigate the spread of infection in the general population.

OBJECTIVESEntertainment-education (E-E) media can improve behavioral intent toward 
health-related practices. In the era of COVID-19, millions of people can be reached by E-E 
media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless, 
animated video about COVID-19 hygiene practices-such as social distancing and frequent 
hand washing-that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a global 
audience. The E-E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear. The study aims to 
achieve the following objectives. To: 1.Quantify people's interest in watching a short, 
animated video about COVID-19 hygiene (abbreviated to CoVideo).2.Establish the 
CoVideo's effectiveness in increasing behavioural intent toward COVID-19 
hygiene.3.Establish the CoVideo's effectiveness in improving COVID-19 hygiene 
knowledge.TRIAL DESIGNThe present study is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of the CoVideo against an attention 
placebo control (APC) video or no video. The trial has an intervention arm (CoVideo),

placebo arm (APC), and control arm (no video). Nested in each trial arm is a list experiment 
and questionnaire survey, with the following ordering. Arm 1: the CoVideo, list experiment, 
and questionnaire survey. Arm 2: the APC video, list experiment, questionnaire survey, and 
CoVideo. Arm 3: the list experiment, questionnaire survey, and CoVideo. For each list 
experiment, participants will be randomized to a control or treatment group. The control 
group will receive a list of five items and the treatment group will receive the same five 
items plus one item about COVID-19 hygiene. We will use the list experiment to reduce 
response bias associated with socially desirable answers to COVID-19 questions. The 
questionnaire survey will include items about the participant's age, sex, country of 
residence, highest education, and knowledge of COVID-19 spread. After completing the list 
experiment and questionnaire survey, participants in Arms 2 and 3 will receive the CoVideo 
to ensure post-trial access to treatment.PARTICIPANTSThis will be an online study setting. 
We will use Prolific Academic (ProA: https://www.prolific.co) to recruit participants and host 
our study on the Gorilla™ platform (www.gorilla.sc). To be eligible, participants must be 
between the age of 18 and 59 years (male, female, or other) and have current residence in 
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Mexico, or France. Participants 
will be excluded from the study if they cannot speak English, German, French, or Spanish 
(since the instructions and survey questions will be available in these 4 languages 
only).INTERVENTION AND COMPARATORThe intervention is an E-E video about COVID-
19 hygiene (CoVideo). Developed by our co-author (MA) for Stanford Medicine, the 
CoVideo is animated with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text. The CoVideo 
shows how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and summarizes 
the public's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Key components of the CoVideo are the 
promotion of five hygiene practices: i) social distancing and avoiding group gatherings, ii) 
frequently washing hands with soap and water or sanitizer, iii) cleaning surfaces at home 
(e.g., kitchen counters), iv) not sharing eating utensils, and v) avoidance of stockpiling 
essential goods (such as toilet paper and face masks). The CoVideo, which was designed 
for universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels, can be viewed at 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8. The comparators are an APC video (Arm 
2) or no video (Arm 3). The APC video is similar in style to the CoVideo; it is also animated 
with a duration of 2.30 minutes, has sound effects but no words, speech, or text. The video 
message is about how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become 
a way of life. It is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw. Each list 
experiment will have a control list as the comparator. The control list is needed to measure 
the prevalence of behavioral intent toward COVID-19 hygiene.MAIN OUTCOMESThis 
study will measure primary and secondary outcomes related to COVID-19 hygiene. By 
hygiene, we mean the adoption of behaviors or practices that reduce the chances of be ing 
infected or spreading COVID-19. As our primary outcome, we will measure changes in 
behavioral intent toward five hygiene practices: social distancing, washing hands, cleaning 
household surfaces, not sharing eating utensils, and not stockpiling essentia l goods. As a 
secondary outcome, we will measure knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the 
spread of COVID-19.RANDOMIZATIONUsing a web-based randomization algorithm, 
Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to the intervention (CoVideo), placebo (APC), or 
control (no video) arm (sequence generation) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Within each trial arm, Gorilla 
will randomly allocate participants at a 1:1 ratio to the control or treatment group. Items in 
the lists will be randomly ordered to avoid order effects. The presentation order of the list 
experiments will also be randomized.BLINDINGBecause ProA handles the interaction 
between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely 
anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and 
submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group 
allocation.NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZEDThe Gorilla algorithm will randomize 6,700 
participants to each trial arm, giving a total sample size of 20,100.TRIAL STATUSThe 
protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is 18 May 2020. Recruitment is expected to

2. Adolescents’ face mask usage and contact transmission in novel coronavirus 
Chao Fang-Lin 2020;1:36.  

The global outbreak of coronavirus has become an international public health threat. 
Prevention is of paramount importance to contain its spread. This study observes face 
mask wearing behavior and contact transmission problems in Taiwan. Teachers track 
student status in class. In addition to measuring body temperature and regular disinfection, 
classrooms require ventilation wear mask, provide alcohol spray and avoid sharing the 
microphone. Both questionnaire surveys and experimental were utilized. A total of 160 
adults residing in Taiwan participated in the survey. The dye simulated the possible virus 
area on the mask surface during usage. Subjects were required to complete a 
questionnaire and simulate the spread of contact transmission when using a computer. 
Eighty-one % of respondents reported consistent use of surgical masks several times a 
day. They reported taking their masks off in relatively safe areas. Most people reported 
using one mask per day and storing the masks in their pockets. As a result, masks surface 
become a contamination source. In the contact experiment, ten adults were requested to 
don and doff a surgical mask while doing a word processing task. The extended 
contamination areas were recorded and identified by image analysis. The results show an 
average contamination area of the workspace is significant 530 cm2. When the hand 
touches the surface of the mask, it may spread the virus to the subsequent contact area.

3. Analysis of a mathematical model for COVID-19 population dynamics in Lagos, 
Nigeria 
Okuonghae D. 2020;:No page numbers.  

This work examines the impact of various non-pharmaceutical control measures 
(government and personal) on the population dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) in Lagos, Nigeria, using an appropriately formulated mathematical model. 
Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we seek to 
develop a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of 
active cases in Lagos; we also estimate the basic reproduction number of the disease

outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we show the 
effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and 
case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. 
We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for 
different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the 
model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing 
regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in 
public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the 
case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the 
population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease 
in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.

4. Applying principles of behaviour change to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 
West Robert Nature human behaviour 2020;4(5):451-459.  

Human behaviour is central to transmission of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-
19, and changing behaviour is crucial to preventing transmission in the absence of 
pharmaceutical interventions. Isolation and social distancing measures, including edicts to 
stay at home, have been brought into place across the globe to reduce transmission of the 
virus, but at a huge cost to individuals and society. In addition to these measures, we 
urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in 
communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled 
droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all 
occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not 
touching one's eyes, nose or mouth. There is an urgent need for direct evidence to inform 
development of such interventions, but it is possible to make a start by applying behavioural 
science methods and models.

5. Back to Normal: An Old Physics Route to Reduce SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in 
Indoor Spaces. 
García de Abajo F. Javier ACS nano 2020;:No page numbers.  

We advocate the widespread use of UV-C light as a short-term, easily deployable, and 
affordable way to limit virus spread in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Radical social 
distancing with the associated shutdown of schools, restaurants, sport clubs, workplaces, 
and traveling has been shown to be effective in reducing virus spread, but its economic and 
social costs are unsustainable in the medium term. Simple measures like frequent 
handwashing, facial masks, and other physical barriers are being commonly adopted to 
prevent virus transmission. However, their efficacy may be limited, particularly in shared 
indoor spaces, where, in addition to airborne transmission, elements with small surface 
areas such as elevator buttons, door handles, and handrails are frequently used and can 
also mediate transmission. We argue that additional measures are necessary to reduce 
virus transmission when people resume attending schools and jobs that require proximity or 
some degree of physical contact. Among the available alternatives, UV-C light satisfies the

6. Comprehensive review of mask utility and challenges during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Tirupathi Raghavendra Le infezioni in medicina 2020;28:57-63.  

Masks are widely discussed during the course of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Most 
hospitals have implemented universal masking for their healthcare workers, and the Center 
for Disease Control currently advises even the general public to wear cloth masks when 
outdoors. The pertinent need for masks arises from plausible dissemination of the SARS-
CoV-2 through close contacts, as well as the possibility of virus transmission from 
asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and mildly symptomatic individuals. Given current global 
shortages in personal protective equipment, the efficacy of various types of masks: N95 
respirators, surgical masks, and cloth masks are researched. To accommodate limited 
supplies, techniques for extended use, reuse, and sterilization of masks are strategized. 
However, masks alone may not greatly slow down the COVID-19 pandemic unless they are 
coupled with adequate social distancing, diligent hand hygiene, and other proven 
preventive measures. 

   

7. COVID-19 pandemic and precautionary measures in Pakistan  
Muhammad Anees 2020;1:94.  

The current outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
has attained the dimensions of a pandemic and World Health Organization (WHO) has 
declared it a global emergency and given it a name of COVID-19. It may remain 
asymptomatic, but usually presents as influenza-like symptoms initially. It spreads from 
zoonotic sources, which are still under investigation. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(RT-PCR) is the only available diagnostic and confirmatory lab assay for SARS-CoV-2. 
There is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, hence infected and 
suspected cases are dependent on supportive treatment along with few anti-HIV drugs. 
Evidence suggests that, in Pakistan, all cases have returned from Iran and Saudi Arabia 
after pilgrimage. The number of patients has been increasing gradually. Almost a ll of the 
neighboring countries of Pakistan are suffering from an outbreak. So, a big threat is there. 
Pakistani health authorities need to take critical action urgently. Moreover, it is necessary to 
take basic preventive measurements including hand washing, use of face masks, keeping 
the distance from suspected patients and avoiding unnecessary traveling to overcrowded 
areas. It is concluded that the developing countries might be at higher risk including 
Pakistan. Personnel and community-based strategy is required to avoid any serious 
consequences in Pakistan. We searched relevant studies and papers from Google, Google 
Scholar, National Institute of Health (Pakistan) and WHO by using various medical subject 
heading (MeSH) terms including COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, MERS, Preventive 
Measurements of COVID etc. All downloaded articles were carefully read and conclusions 
drawn.

9. Fabrics tested for their ability to filter aerosols 
Anon. 2020;:No page numbers.  

Tightly woven cotton, such as that used to make high-thread-count sheets;four layers of 
silk;and mixtures of fabric, such as cotton and flannel or cotton and chiffon, are good 
materials for making masks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, 
scientists report According to a new study, masks made from these fabrics are good at 
filtering saltwater aerosols 10 nm to 6 µm—the same size as droplets that are known to 
spread respiratory viruses (ACS Nano 2020, DOI: 10 1021/acsnano 0c03252) Droplets this 
size tend to stay suspended in air Last month, upon learning the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention would recommend that people wear face coverings, scientists at the 
Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering, the University of Chicago, and Argonne National 
Laboratory decided to test the filtration properties of various fabrics “There was very little 
scientific data taken with laboratory-grade instruments on this,” says Supratik Guha,

10. Face mask designs following novel coronavirus 
Chao Fang-Lin 2020;1:31.  

Doctors need to wear complete protective equipment when large numbers of patients flood 
into the emergency room. Taiwan has so far managed to prevent a large scale community 
outbreak, city forces wearing face masks on public transportation, and keep social 
distancing to stem the virus from spreading. The protective device may be contaminated 
and must be replaced. In the situation of limited resources, how to take care of the 
physiological needs of the doctor without increasing the chance of contamination during 
replacement is a consideration. By reducing the chance of contamination during removal 
and storage, the previous designs were analyzed and improved. We proposed three 
improved designs to reduce the contact. Design-A features a mask with a water channel 
that allows the user to remain hydrated without removing the cover. Design-B has a folding 
pattern that hides the outer surface. Design-C combines the mask with the brim of a cap

Abstract Objective To identify, systematically review, and summarize the best scientific 
evidence available on the efficacy and safety of homemade cloth face masks for the 
community Methods The search was conducted using the Cochrane, PUBMED, EMBASE, 
and LILACS databases, as well as grey literature, using Opengrey A search was also 
conducted using references from primary and secondary studies that were found No 
language or time period restrictions were applied All papers that objective was to check 
efficacy and safety of the use of cloth face masks as protection against viral transmission 
were included, as well as laboratory studies assessing barriers against particles We 
excluded studies approaching the use of face masks by healthcare providers Two 
independent reviewers selected the studies, and discrepancies were decided by a third 
reviewer Results No randomized clinical trials involving cloth face masks for the general 
population were found Seven studies assessing different types of clo th to prevent the 
penetration of droplets at a laboratory level and a review study were included Conclusion 
Using cloth face masks provides a barrier against droplets when compared with not using 
any face masks The face mask is an additional preventive mesuare and must be used 
along with respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene, social distancing, and isolation of cases

Anon. 2020;:No page numbers.  

With cases of COVID-19 growing rapidly in the US and evidence mounting that the virus 
responsible, SARS-CoV-2, can be spread by infected people before they develop 
symptoms, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended April 3 that 
people wear cloth face coverings in public places This guidance is a shift from the center’s 
previous position that healthy people needed to wear masks only when caring for a sick 
person The recommendation also follows recent calls by experts on social media and other 
platforms for the general public to don nonmedical, cloth masks to help reduce the 
transmission of the novel coronavirus “Members of the general public should wear non -
medical fabric face masks when going out in public in one additional societal effort to slow 
the spread of the virus down,” Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for

13. Identifying airborne transmission as the dominant route for the spread of COVID-19. 
Zhang Renyi Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of 
America 2020;117(26):14857-14863.  

Various mitigation measures have been implemented to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing and mandated face 
covering. However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on 
the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that 
airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the 
disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New 
York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation 
measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the 
difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping 
the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly 
reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and 
over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as 
social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in 
protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the 
most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in 
conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents 
the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also 
highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and 
future public health pandemics.

14. Influence of wind and relative humidity on the social distancing effectiveness to 
prevent COVID-19 airborne transmission: A numerical study. 
Feng Yu Journal of aerosol science 2020;:105585.  

It has been confirmed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can transmit through 
droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes. Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) 
social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is 
based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well 
investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 
laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy 
insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the "social distancing" guidelines, a 
validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate 
the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden 
droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial 
droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 μm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 
16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The 
comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also 
been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual 
humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing 
the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results 
indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with 
recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines 
well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) 
separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 
3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people.

High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which 
increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex 
environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be 
sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-
droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human 
coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s. Thus, due to the complex real-world 
environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be 
considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy 
humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.

15. Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices of Healthcare Workers Regarding the Use of Face 
Mask to Limit the Spread of the New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) 
Kumar Jagdesh 2020;:No page numbers.  

Introduction Many countries including Pakistan are currently using face masks in their 
pandemic control plans Being highly prevalent, the correct use of these masks is 
particularly important, as an incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the rate of 
transmission The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and 
practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) in wearing a surgical face mask to limit the spread 
of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Materials and Methods This survey was 
conducted by interviewing HCWs using a questionnaire consisting of the basic 
demographic characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the use 
of surgical face mask to limit the new COVID-19 exposure Each correct answer was scored

score was calculated and then labeled according to the percentage (out of 16) of correct 
responses as good (&amp;gt;80%), moderate (60-80%), and poor (&amp;lt;60%) Results A 
total of 392 participants with a mean age of 42 37 +/- 13 34 years (341 males and 51 
females) were included in the study The overall final results were good in 138 (35 2%), 
moderate in 178 (45 4%), and poor in 76 (19 3%) Around 43 6% of participants knew about 
the correct method of wearing the masks, 68 9% knew that there are three layers, 53% 
stated that the middle layer act as a filter media barrier, and 75 5% knew the recommended 
maximum duration of wearing it The majority (88 2%) of participants knew that a cloth face 
mask is not much effective, around 79 8% knew that used face mask cannot be re-used, 
and 44 8% knew about the yellow-coded bag for disposal Conclusions Knowledge, attitude, 
and practice of HCWs regarding the use of face masks were found to be inadequate 
Studied HCWs had a positive attitude but moderate-to-poor level of knowledge and practice 
regarding the use of face mask HCWs and general public awareness campaigns regarding 
the proper use of face mask by utilizing all social media available resources would be 
helpful during this pandemic

Rapid transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to the 
novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current emphasis is on 
preventive strategies such as social distancing, face mask, and hand washing. The 
technique of nasopharyngeal wash to prevent the virus from inhabiting and replicating in 
the nasal and pharyngeal mucosa has been suggested to be useful in reducing symptoms, 
transmission, and viral shedding in cases of viral acute respiratory tract infections. In rapid 
systematic review, we found studies showing some improvement in prevention and 
treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. We postulate that hypertonic saline gargles 
and nasal wash may be useful in prevention and for care of patients with COVID-19. The 
present evidence emphasizes the need of randomized controlled trials to evaluate the role 
and mechanism of nasopharyngeal wash in COVID-19.

Zamir Mohammad 2020;:No page numbers.  

Background and Objective The outbreak of the current pandemic begun from the first 
individual of a 55-year old from Hubei province in China, the disease instigated by the new 
coronavirus spreading across the world Scientists presently speculate this coronavirus, 
SARS-CoV-2, originated in a bat and by one way or another jumped to another creature, 
potentially the pangolin, which at that point gave it to people The ailment is currently 
spreading between individuals with no animal delegate Researchers are struggling to follow 
the infection back to where it started to become familiar with its spread In the event that, for 
example, specialists can locate the soonest cases, they might have the option to distinguish 
the creature have where the infection hides In March and April 2020, researchers detailed 
that this virus created normally Coronavirus has been become of the serious global 
phenomena in the recent years and has negative effects in the entire world health and 
economy The virus is believed to have been associated with a host animal which human 
contracted Subsequently, human-to-human infection began Through migration as humans 
have become complex with easy mobility the disease has traveled to the entire continent 
Now, numerous scientist are going on in the hope of obtaining medication and vaccination 
to prevent the spread of the disease and mortality of the disease It is important that we 
obtain quantitative and qualitative information about the etiology of this disease which is 
crucial Mathematical modeling is capable of providing qualitative information on many 
parameters that guides the decision making of health practitioners In this work we focus the 
optimal control of COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) To 
find the role of factors/parameters in the transmission of the syndrome we find R0;the ratio 
of reproduction for the proposed model Methods To find the role of parameters in the 
transmission of the syndrome we find R0;the ratio of reproduction for the proposed model 
On the basis of sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical 
Interventions(NPIs) to control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal 
control mode With the help of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian we minimize the density of 
contaminated stuff and infected human population Results We focus the optimal contro l of 
COVID-19 with the help of Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) On the basis of 
sensitivity indices of the parameters we apply Non Pharmaceutical Interventions(NPIs) to 
control the sensitive parameters and hence formulate the optimal control model The major 
NPIs are, STAY HOME, SANITIZER (wash hands), EARLY CASE DETECTION (PCR 
Test) and FACE MASK These NPIs helps in mitigation and reducing the size of outbreak of 
the disease Conclusion We check the existence of the optimal solution for the system At 
the end, Using matlab we produce numerical simulations for validation of results of control

18. On respiratory droplets and face masks. 
Dbouk Talib Physics of fluids (Woodbury, N.Y. : 1994) 2020;32(6):063303.  

Face mask filters-textile, surgical, or respiratory-are widely used in an effort to limit the 
spread of airborne viral infections. Our understanding of the droplet dynamics around a 
face mask filter, including the droplet containment and leakage from and passing through 
the cover, is incomplete. We present a fluid dynamics study of the transmission of 
respiratory droplets through and around a face mask filter. By employing multiphase 
computational fluid dynamics in a fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian framework, we 
investigate the droplet dynamics induced by a mild coughing incident and examine the fluid 
dynamics phenomena affecting the mask efficiency. The model takes into account turbulent 
dispersion forces, droplet phase-change, evaporation, and breakup in addition to the 
droplet-droplet and droplet-air interactions. The model mimics real events by using data, 
which closely resemble cough experiments. The study shows that the criteria employed for 
assessing the face mask performance must be modified to take into account the 
penetration dynamics of airborne droplet transmission, the fluid dynamics leakage around 
the filter, and reduction of efficiency during cough cycles. A new criterion for calculating 
more accurately the mask efficiency by taking into account the penetration dynamics is 
proposed. We show that the use of masks will reduce the airborne droplet transmission and 
will also protect the wearer from the droplets expelled from other subjects. However, many 
droplets still spread around and away from the cover, cumulatively, during cough cycles. 
Therefore, the use of a mask does not provide complete protection, and social distancing 
remains important during a pandemic. The implications of the reduced mask efficiency and 
respiratory droplet transmission away from the mask are even more critical for healthcare 
workers. The results of this study provide evidence of droplet transmission prevention by 
face masks, which can guide their use and further improvement.

ImportanceThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, due to the novel severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide sudden 
and substantial increase in hospitalizations for pneumonia with multiorgan disease. This 
review discusses current evidence regarding the pathophysiology, transmission, diagnosis, 
and management of COVID-19.ObservationsSARS-CoV-2 is spread primarily via 
respiratory droplets during close face-to-face contact. Infection can be spread by

asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. The average time from exposure 
to symptom onset is 5 days, and 97.5% of people who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 
days. The most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. 
Radiographic and laboratory abnormalities, such as lymphopenia and elevated lactate 
dehydrogenase, are common, but nonspecific. Diagnosis is made by detection of SARS-
CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing, although false-negative 
test results may occur in up to 20% to 67% of patients; however, this is dependent on the 
quality and timing of testing. Manifestations of COVID-19 include asymptomatic carriers 
and fulminant disease characterized by sepsis and acute respiratory failure. Approximately 
5% of patients with COVID-19, and 20% of those hospitalized, experience severe 
symptoms necessitating intensive care. More than 75% of patients hospitalized with 
COVID-19 require supplemental oxygen. Treatment for individuals with COVID-19 includes 
best practices for supportive management of acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Emerging 
data indicate that dexamethasone therapy reduces 28-day mortality in patients requiring 
supplemental oxygen compared with usual care (21.6% vs 24.6%; age-adjusted rate ratio, 
0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]) and that remdesivir improves time to recovery (hospital discharge 
or no supplemental oxygen requirement) from 15 to 11 days. In a randomized trial of 103 
patients with COVID-19, convalescent plasma did not shorten time to recovery. Ongoing 
trials are testing antiviral therapies, immune modulators, and anticoagulants. The case -
fatality rate for COVID-19 varies markedly by age, ranging from 0.3 deaths per 1000 cases 
among patients aged 5 to 17 years to 304.9 deaths per 1000 cases among patients aged 
85 years or older in the US. Among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit, the case 
fatality is up to 40%. At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development. Until an 
effective vaccine is available, the primary methods to reduce spread are face masks, social 
distancing, and contact tracing. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperimmune globulin may 
provide additional preventive strategies.Conclusions and RelevanceAs of July 1, 2020, 
more than 10 million people worldwide had been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Many aspects 
of transmission, infection, and treatment remain unclear. Advances in prevention and 
effective management of COVID-19 will require basic and clinical investigation and public 
health and clinical interventions.

20. Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis. 
Chu Derek K. Lancet (London, England) 2020;395(10242):1973-1987.  

BACKGROUNDSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes 
COVID-19 and is spread person-to-person through close contact. We aimed to investigate 
the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in 
health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.METHODSWe did a systematic 
review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-
person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to 
prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the 
betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We 
searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by 
language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, 
resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias

in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-
regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the 
GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, 
CRD42020177047.FINDINGSOur search identified 172 observational studies across 16 
countries and six continents, with no randomised controlled trials and 44 relevant 
comparative studies in health-care and non-health-care settings (n=25 697 patients). 
Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with 
a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 
to 0·38; risk difference [RD] -10·2%, 95% CI -11·5 to -7·5; moderate certainty); protection 
was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; 
pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in 
risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 to 0·34, RD -14·3%, -15·9 to -10·7; low 
certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with 
disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12-16-layer cotton masks; 
pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability >95%, low certainty). Eye protection also was 
associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 to 0·39, RD -10·6%, 95% 
CI -12·5 to -7·7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses 
showed similar findings.INTERPRETATIONThe findings of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative 
estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, 
respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by 
these findings and contextual factors. Robust randomised trials are needed to better inform 
the evidence for these interventions, but this systematic appraisal of currently best available 
evidence might inform interim guidance.FUNDINGWorld Health Organization.

population-based study in Korea with four surveys conducted on June 2 and 25, 2015 
(MERS-CoV surveys), and February 4, and April 2, 2020 (COVID-19 surveys). Of 25,711 
participants selected using random digit dialing numbers, 4,011 participants (aged ≥ 18 
years) were successfully interviewed, for the 2020 COVID-19 (n = 2,002) and 2015 MERS-
CoV (n = 2,009) epidemics were included. Participants were selected post-stratification by 
sex, age, and province. The total number of weighted cases in this survey equaled the total 
number of unweighted cases at the national level. We measured the levels of preventive 
behaviors (social distancing [avoiding physical contact with others]), and practicing 
transmission-reducing behaviors such as wearing face mask and 
handwashing.RESULTSBetween the surveys, respondents who reported practicing social 
distancing increased from 41.9%-58.2% (MERS-CoV) to 83.4%-92.3% (COVID-19). The 
response rate for the four surveys ranged between 13.7% and 17.7%. Practicing 
transmission-reducing behaviors (wearing face masks and handwashing) at least once 
during COVID-19 (78.8%, 80.2%) also increased compared to that during MERS-CoV 
(15.5%, 60.3%). The higher affective risk perception groups were more likely to practice 
transmission-reducing measures (adjusted odds ratio, 3.24-4.81; 95 confidence interval, 
1.76-6.96) during both COVID-19 and MERS-CoV.CONCLUSIONThe study findings 
suggest markedly increased proportions of non-pharmaceutical behavioral practices evenly 
across all subgroups during the two different novel virus outbreaks in Korea. Strategic 
interventions are needed to attempt based on preventive behavior works.

23. Strongly Heterogeneous Transmission of COVID-19 in Mainland China: Local and 
Regional Variation 
Wang Yuke 2020;:No page numbers.  

Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in the 
city of Wuhan, China, with a period of rapid initial spread Transmission on a regional and 
then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese 
New Year We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well 
as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland 
China Methods: In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to 
assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19 This enabled 
estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small 
and large regions Findings: We estimated the average serial interval was 4 8 days For early 
transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, 
transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two During 
the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, 
generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low 
Interpretation: COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly The sizes of outbreak in 
provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from 
Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low The COVID-19 epidemic should be 
controllable with appropriate interventions (suspension of public transportation, cancellation 
of mass gatherings, implementation of surveillance and testing, and promotion of personal 
hygiene and face mask use)

24. Textile Masks and Surface Covers-A Spray Simulation Method and a "Universal 
Droplet Reduction Model" Against Respiratory Pandemics. 
Rodriguez-Palacios Alex Frontiers in medicine 2020;7:260.  

The main form of COVID-19 transmission is via "oral-respiratory droplet contamination" 
(droplet: very small drop of liquid) produced when individuals talk, sneeze, or cough. In 
hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical "droplet precaution" 
to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given 
to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is 
discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in 
public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of "environmental 
droplet contamination" (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing 
transmission. As an immediate solution to promote "public droplet safety," we assessed 
household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers 
(EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal "community droplet reduction 
solution" is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray 
simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by 
which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces 
within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 "social distancing." All 
textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to <30 
cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as 
medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to <10 cm, and the area 
of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a 
"community droplet reduction solution" (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) 
will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.

25. The COVID-19 pandemic: biological evolution, treatment options and consequences  
Das Sovik 2020;3:No page numbers.  

The spread of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the pandemic COVID-19 has 
emerged as a global matter of concern in the last couple of months. It has rapidly spread 
around the globe, which initially began in the city of Wuhan, People’s Republic o f China and 
is hypothesized to originate from the group of Rhinolophus bats. Till date, there has been 
no clinically proven vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 and thus the doctors are employing 
the other well-known techniques, which have previously successfully tackled similar other 
human coronaviruses. To prevent the further spread of COVID-19, doctors are advising 
isolation of the infected patients, and also regular washing of hands and the use of face 
mask for the common people. In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the countries are 
going for nationwide lockdown as the only preventive measure to avert community 
transmission of this disease, which is having economic, social and psychological effect on 
the general mass. Therefore, this comprehensive review art icle encapsulates the biological 
evolution of human coronaviruses, probable treatment and control strategies to combat 
COVID-19 and, its impact on human life.

26. The face mask: How a real protection becomes a psychological symbol during 
Covid-19? 
Goh Yihui Brain, behavior, and immunity 2020;:No page numbers.  

'The Mask' has become a byword and a precious possession universally. Except for its use 
by the medical fraternity, answers to the common questions-whether it provides enough 
protection, which type is optimal for the general public and who really needs to don it, 
remain poorly understood. For a frontline healthcare worker, wearing mask is a necessity 
as an important person protection equipment, it is perhaps the most-powerful psychological 
symbol for the general public. Surprisingly, it even undermines all other recommended 
practices of infection control and breaking the transmission chain of Covid-19, like hand 
washing, personal hygiene and social distancing. 'The mask' has evolved with time and yet 
there is a need to further improve the design for safety, tolerability and comfort. In this 
review we present the journey of face mask, originating from the first masks aimed at 
stopping the bad smell to its industrial use to its all-important place in the medical field. 
Various types of face masks, their filtration efficiency, reusability and current 
recommendations for their use are presented.

27. The role of community-wide wearing of face mask for control of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) epidemic due to SARS-CoV-2. 
Cheng Vincent Chi-Chung The Journal of infection 2020;81(1):107-114.  

BACKGROUNDFace mask usage by the healthy population in the community to reduce 
risk of transmission of respiratory viruses remains controversial. We assessed the effect of 
community-wide mask usage to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).METHODSPatients presenting with 
respiratory symptoms at outpatient clinics or hospital wards were screened for COVID-19 
per protocol. Epidemiological analysis was performed for confirmed cases, especially 
persons acquiring COVID-19 during mask-off and mask-on settings. The incidence of 
COVID-19 per million population in HKSAR with community-wide masking was compared 
to that of non-mask-wearing countries which are comparable with HKSAR in terms of 
population density, healthcare system, BCG vaccination and social distancing measures 
but not community-wide masking. Compliance of face mask usage in the HKSAR 
community was monitored.FINDINGSWithin first 100 days (31 December 2019 to 8 April 
2020), 961 COVID-19 patients were diagnosed in HKSAR. The COVID-19 incidence in 
HKSAR (129.0 per million population) was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that of Spain 
(2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), 
Singapore (259.8), and South Korea (200.5). The compliance of face mask usage by

28. To mask or not to mask: Modeling the potential for face mask use by the general 
public to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Eikenberry Steffen E. Infectious Disease Modelling 2020;5:293-308.  

Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is 
controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential of this intervention is not 
well understood. We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide 
impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be 
asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics 
in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even 
relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of 
COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases 
the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask 
effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as 
a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, 
hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-
pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both 
preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. 
Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that 
immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately (50%) effective masks could 
prevent on the order of 17-45% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while 
decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34-58%, absent other changes in epidemic 
dynamics. Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying 
transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline 
transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 
24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York 
(peak death reduction 9-18%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public 
is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the 
pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are 
used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), 
and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.

29. Use of Health Belief Model-Based Deep Learning Classifiers for COVID-19 Social 
Media Content to Examine Public Perceptions of Physical Distancing: Model 
Development and Case Study. 
Sesagiri Raamkumar Aravind JMIR public health and surveillance 2020;6(3):e20493.  

BACKGROUNDPublic health authorities have been recommending interventions such as 
physical distancing and face masks, to curtail the transmission of coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) within the community. Public perceptions toward such interventions should be 
identified to enable public health authorities to effectively address valid concerns. The

Health Belief Model (HBM) has been used to characterize user-generated content from 
social media during previous outbreaks, with the aim of understanding the health behaviors 
of the public.OBJECTIVEThis study is aimed at developing and evaluating deep learning -
based text classification models for classifying social media content posted during the 
COVID-19 outbreak, using the four key constructs of the HBM. We will specifically focus on 
content related to the physical distancing interventions put forth by public health authorities. 
We intend to test the model with a real-world case study.METHODSThe data set for this 
study was prepared by analyzing Facebook comments that were posted by the public in 
response to the COVID-19-related posts of three public health authorities: the Ministry of 
Health of Singapore (MOH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Public 
Health England. The comments made in the context of physical distancing were manually 
classified with a Yes/No flag for each of the four HBM constructs: perceived severity, 
perceived susceptibility, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits. Using a curated data 
set of 16,752 comments, gated recurrent unit-based recurrent neural network models were 
trained and validated for text classification. Accuracy and binary cross-entropy loss were 
used to evaluate the model. Specificity, sensitivity, and balanced accuracy were used to 
evaluate the classification results in the MOH case study.RESULTSThe HBM text 
classification models achieved mean accuracy rates of 0.92, 0.95, 0.91, and 0.94 for the 
constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived 
barriers, respectively. In the case study with MOH Facebook comments, specificity was 
above 96% for all HBM constructs. Sensitivity was 94.3% and 90.9% for perceived severity 
and perceived benefits, respectively. In addition, sensitivity was 79.6% and 81.5% for 
perceived susceptibility and perceived barriers, respectively. The classification models were 
able to accurately predict trends in the prevalence of the constructs for the time period 
examined in the case study.CONCLUSIONSThe deep learning-based text classifiers 
developed in this study help to determine public perceptions toward physical distancing, 
using the four key constructs of HBM. Health officials can make use of the classification 
model to characterize the health behaviors of the public through the lens of social media. In 
future studies, we intend to extend the model to study public perceptions of other important 
interventions by public health authorities.
