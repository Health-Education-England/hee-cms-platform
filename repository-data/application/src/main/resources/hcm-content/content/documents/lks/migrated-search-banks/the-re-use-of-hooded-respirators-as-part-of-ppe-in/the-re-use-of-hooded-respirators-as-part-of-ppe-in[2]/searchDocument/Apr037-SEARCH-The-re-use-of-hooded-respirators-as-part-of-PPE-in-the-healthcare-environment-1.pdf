Abstract BACKGROUNDThe reliability of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) depends on correct fitting. The 

perceived usability of FFRs is equally important because discomfort during usage may affect compliance. Body 
movements during nursing procedures may also increase the risk of face seal leakage.AIMTo evaluate the mask 
fit and usability of the best-fitting 3M N95 FFR and the nanofibre N95 FFR before and after nursing 
procedures. The physical properties of these FFRs were also examined.METHODSThis experimental study had 
a one-group multiple comparison design. In total, 104 nursing students participated, and performed nursing 
procedures for 10 min when wearing the best-fitting 3M FFR and the nanofibre FFR. Mask fit and perceived 
usability of the FFRs were evaluated.FINDINGSMore participants failed to obtain a fit factor ≥100 when using 
the best-fitting 3M FFR than when wearing the nanofibre FFR (33.7% vs 21.2%) after the procedures (P=0.417). 
The nanofibre FFR also demonstrated higher usability than the 3M FFRs in terms of facial heat, breathability, 
facial pressure, speech intelligibility, itchiness, difficulty of maintaining the mask in place, and comfort level 
(P<0.001). The nanofibre FFR was also lighter, thinner and had slightly higher bacterial filtration efficiency than 
the 3M FFRs.CONCLUSIONThe nanofibre FFR demonstrated significantly better usability than the 3M FFRs. 
None of the respirators were able to provide consistent protection for the wearer, as detected by face seal 
leakage after performing nursing procedures. Further improvement in the prototype design is needed to 
increase compliance and ensure the respiratory protection of users.

Abstract OBJECTIVES: Infection control policies and guidelines recommend using facemasks and respirators to protect 
healthcare workers (HCWs) from respiratory infections. Common types of respirators used in healthcare 
settings are filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Aims of this 
study were to examine the current attitudes and practices of HCWs regarding the selection and use of 
respiratory protection and determine the acceptability of a novel PAPR. 
METHOD(S): In-depth interviews were undertaken with 20 HCWs from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, 
Australia. Participants were fit tested with a lightweight tight-fitting half-facepiece PAPR (CleanSpace2TM 
Power Unit, PAF-0034, by CleanSpace Technology) using the TSITM Portacount quantitative fit test method. 
RESULT(S): Interview results showed that HCWs had a limited role in the selection and use of facemasks and 
respirators and had been using the devices provided by the hospital. The majority of subjects had no knowledge 
of hospital policy for the use of facemasks and respirators, had not been trained on the use of respirators, and 
had not been fit tested previously. Compliance with the use of facemasks and respirators was perceived as 
being low and facemasks and respirators were typically used only for short periods of time.All 20 participants 
were successfully fit tested to the CleanSpace2TM PAPR (overall geometric mean fit factor-6768). According to 
the exit surveys, CleanSpace2TM PAPRs were easy to don (14/20) and doff (15/20) and comfortable to wear 
(14/20). Most participants believed that PAPRs provide higher protection, comfort and reusability over N95 
FFR and can be used during pandemics and other high-risk situations. 
CONCLUSION(S): HCWs should be aware of infection control policies and training should be provided on the 
correct use of respiratory protective devices. PAPRs can be used in hospital settings to protect HCWs from 
certain highly infectious and emerging pathogens, however, HCWs require adequate training on storage, use, 
and cleaning of PAPRs.

Abstract BACKGROUNDCurrently, powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are not recommended for usage in close 

proximity to sterile fields owing to concerns that exhaled, unfiltered air potentially may cause contamination; 
however, this has not been confirmed by experimental study.METHODSAfter establishing background levels of 
airborne contamination, our team placed settling plates in a sterile field and collected contamination from 
participants who were performing particulate-generating actions. Participants performed the actions while 
wearing various forms of respiratory protection, including: (1) a full facepiece PAPR, (2) a full facepiece PAPR 
with a shoulder-length hood, (3) a surgical mask, and (4) no facial covering (as a positive control to determine 
contamination-reduction effectiveness). Specimens were collected at the end of a 10-minute sampling time 
frame. After incubation at 36.5˚C for 72 hours, we tabulated colony forming units as a marker of 
contamination.RESULTSSurgical masks and the 2 PAPR configurations all drastically reduced aerosolized 
droplet contamination. Surgical masks reduced contamination by 98.48%, and both PAPRs reduced 
contamination by 100% (compared with the usage of no facial covering). There was no statistical difference 
between their effectiveness (surgical mask vs both PAPRs, P value = .588 and no hood PAPR vs hood PAPR, P 
value >.999).DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONSBased on these findings, the tested PAPR configurations are 
effective at reducing aerosolized droplet contamination into a sterile field, and further testing is warranted to 
assess other PAPR configurations as well as PAPR suitability in an operating room.

Abstract Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), a new respiratory infectious disease, has become an important public 

health problem. Inappropriate protection and disinfection measures are potential risk factors of transmission 
and outbreak of NCP in key places. This theme issue is concerned with the prevention and control of NCP. 
Comprehensive measures and suggestions for protection and disinfection are put forward from perspectives of 
functional areas in key places, such as hotels, mobile cabin hospitals, passenger transport stations and public 
transport facilities, environment and facilities, personal protection, operation management system, etc., so as to 
provide technical support for the prevention and control of new respiratory infectious diseases.

Abstract Pandemics and re-emerging diseases put pressure on the health care system to prepare for patient care and 
sample logistics requiring enhanced personnel protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers. We 
generated quantifiable data on ergonomics of PPE applicable in a health care setting by defining error rates and 
physically limiting factors due to PPE-induced restrictions. Nineteen study volunteers tested randomly 
allocated head- or full body-ventilated PPE suits equipped with powered-air-purifying-respirators and 
performed four different tasks (two laboratory tutorials, a timed test of selective attention and a test 
investigating reaction time, mobility, speed and physical exercise) during 6 working hours at 22°C on one day 
and 4 working hours at 28°C on another day. Error rates and physical parameters (fluid loss, body temperature, 
heart rate) were determined and ergonomic-related parameters were assessed hourly using assessment sheets. 
Depending on the PPE system the most restrictive factors, which however had no negative impact on 
performance (speed and error rate), were: reduced dexterity due to multiple glove layers, impaired visibility by 
flexible face shields and back pain related to the respirator of the fully ventilated suit. Heat stress and liquid loss 
were perceived as restrictive at a working temperature of 28°C but not 22°C.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe safe removal of personal protective equipment (PPE) can limit transmission of serious 
communicable diseases, but this process poses challenges to healthcare workers (HCWs).METHODSWe 
observed 41 HCWs across 4 Ebola treatment centers in Georgia doffing PPE for simulated patients with serious 
communicable diseases. Using human factors methodologies, we obtained the details, sequences, and durations 
of doffing steps; identified the ways each step can fail (failure modes [FMs]); quantified the riskiness of FMs; and 
characterized the workload of doffing steps.RESULTSEight doffing steps were common to all hospitals-removal 
of boot covers, gloves (outer and inner pairs), the outermost garment, the powered air purifying respirator 
(PAPR) hood, and the PAPR helmet assembly; repeated hand hygiene (eg, with hand sanitizer); and a final 
handwashing with soap and water. Across hospitals, we identified 256 FMs during the common doffing steps, 61 
of which comprised 19 common FMs. Most of these common FMs were above average in their riskiness at each 
hospital. At all hospitals, hand hygiene, removal of the outermost garment, and removal of boot covers were 
above average in their overall riskiness. Measurements of workload revealed that doffing steps were often 
mentally demanding, and this facet of workload correlated most strongly with the effortfulness of a doffing 
step.CONCLUSIONSWe systematically identified common points of concern in protocols for doffing high-level 
PPE. Addressing FMs related to hand hygiene and the removal of the outermost garment, boot covers, and 
PAPR hood could improve HCW safety when doffing high-level PPE.We identified ways that doffing protocols 
for high-level personal protective equipment may fail to protect healthcare workers. Hand hygiene, removing 
the outermost garment, boot covers, and respirator hood harbored the greatest risk and failed in similar ways 
across different hospitals.

Abstract BACKGROUNDIn epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or Severe Acute 

Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general 
population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Contact precautions by means of 
personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is 
the best way to remove PPE, and how to make sure HCW use PPE as instructed.OBJECTIVESTo evaluate which 
type of full body PPE and which method of donning or doffing PPE have the least risk of self-contamination or 
infection for HCW, and which training methods increase compliance with PPE protocols.SEARCH 
METHODSWe searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 15 July 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Trials 
(CENTRAL up to 18 June 2019), Scopus (Scopus 18 June 2019), CINAHL (EBSCOhost 31 July 2018), and OSH-
Update (up to 31 December 2018). We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews, and 
contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE.SELECTION CRITERIAWe included all controlled studies that 
compared the effects of PPE used by HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, 
such as Ebola or SARS, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included 
studies that used simulated contamination with fluorescent markers or a non-pathogenic virus.We also 
included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or doffing PPE, and the effects of training 
in PPE use on the same outcomes.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISTwo authors independently selected 
studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We planned to perform meta-analyses but did 
not find sufficiently similar studies to combine their results.MAIN RESULTSWe included 17 studies with 1950 
participants evaluating 21 interventions. Ten studies are Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), one is a quasi 
RCT and six have a non-randomised controlled design. Two studies are awaiting assessment.Ten studies 
compared types of PPE but only six of these reported sufficient data. Six studies compared different types of 
donning and doffing and three studies evaluated different types of training. Fifteen studies used simulated 
exposure with fluorescent markers or harmless viruses. In simulation studies, contamination rates varied from 
10% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study HCW were exposed to Ebola and in another to 
SARS.Evidence for all outcomes is based on single studies and is very low quality.Different types of PPEPPE 
made of more breathable material may not lead to more contamination spots on the trunk (Mean Difference 
(MD) 1.60 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.15 to 3.35) than more water repellent material but may have 
greater user satisfaction (MD -0.46; 95% CI -0.84 to -0.08, scale of 1 to 5).Gowns may protect better against 
contamination than aprons (MD large patches -1.36 95% CI -1.78 to -0.94).The use of a powered air-purifying 
respirator may protect better than a simple ensemble of PPE without such respirator (Relative Risk (RR) 0.27; 
95% CI 0.17 to 0.43).Five different PPE ensembles (such as gown vs. coverall, boots with or without covers, 
hood vs. cap, length and number of gloves) were evaluated in one study, but there were no event data available 
for compared groups.Alterations to PPE design may lead to less contamination such as added tabs to grab 
masks (RR 0.33; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.80) or gloves (RR 0.22 95% CI 0.15 to 0.31), a sealed gown and glove 
combination (RR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.78), or a better fitting gown around the neck, wrists and hands (RR 0.08; 
95% CI 0.01 to 0.55) compared to standard PPE.Different methods of donning and doffing proceduresDouble 
gloving may lead to less contamination compared to single gloving (RR 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78).Following 
CDC recommendations for doffing may lead to less contamination compared to no guidance (MD small patches 
-5.44; 95% CI -7.43 to -3.45).Alcohol-based hand rub used during the doffing process may not lead to less 
contamination than the use of a hypochlorite based solution (MD 4.00; 95% CI 0.47 to 34.24).Additional spoken 
instruction may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4).Different types of trainingThe use 
of additional computer simulation may lead to fewer errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7).A video 
lecture on donning PPE may lead to better skills scores (MD 30.70; 95% CI 20.14,41.26) than a traditional 
lecture.Face to face instruction may reduce noncompliance with doffing guidance more (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 
to 0.98) than providing folders or videos only.There were no studies on effects of training in the long term or on 
resource use.The quality of the evidence is very low for all comparisons because of high risk of bias in all studies, 
indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSWe found very low 
quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater 
user satisfaction. Alterations to PPE, such as tabs to grab may decrease contamination. Double gloving, 
following CDC doffing guidance, and spoken instructions during doffing may reduce contamination and 
increase compliance. Face-to-face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than video or folder based 
training. Because data come from single small studies with high risk of bias, we are uncertain about the 
estimates of effects.We still need randomised controlled trials to find out which training works best in the long 
term. We need better simulation studies conducted with several dozen participants to find out which PPE 
protects best, and what is the safest way to remove PPE. Consensus on the best way to conduct simulation of 
exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. HCW exposed to highly infectious diseases should 
have their use of PPE registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection in the field.

Abstract The objective of this pilot study was to determine the minimum operational flow for loose-fitting powered air-

purifying respirators (PAPR) used in healthcare cleaning services. An innovative respiratory flow recording 
device was worn by nine healthcare workers to obtain the minute volume (MV, L/min), mean inhalation flow 
(MIF, L/min), and peak inhalation flow (PIF, L/min) while performing "isolation unit work" (cleaning and 
disinfecting) of a patient room within 30 min. The MV and PIF were compared with the theoretical values 
obtained from an empirical formula. The correlations of MV, MIF, and PIF with subjects' age, weight, height, 
body surface area (ADu), and body mass index (BMI) were analyzed. The average MV, MIF, and PIF were 33, 74, 
and 107 L/min, with maximal airflow rates of 41, 97, and 145 L/min, respectively, which are all below the 
current 170 L/min minimum operational flow for NIOSH certified loose-fitting PAPRs.

Abstract Background: Inclusion of reusable respirators, such as elastomeric half-face respirators (EHFRs) and powered 

air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), in hospital respiratory protection inventories may represent 1 solution to the 
problem of N95 respirator shortages experienced during pandemics. User acceptance of these devices is 1 
potential barrier to implementing such a strategy in respiratory protection programs. 
Method(s): To assess user attitudes toward various respirators, health care workers enrolled in respiratory 
protection programs in a medical system using EHFRs, N95s, and PAPRs and completed an online questionnaire 
that addressed attitudes, beliefs, and respirator preferences under different risk scenarios. Responses were 
compared between user groups. 
Result(s): Of 1,152 participants, 53% currently used N95s, 24% used EHFRs, and 23% used PAPRs. N95 users 
rated their respirators more favorably compared with EHFR and PAPR users (P < .001) regarding comfort and 
communication, however, EHFR users rated their respirators much more highly regarding sense of protection (P 
< .001). For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely (odds ratios 2.3-7.7) to be 
preferred over N95 filtering facepiece respirators in higher risk scenarios compared to "usual circumstance" 
scenarios. 
Conclusion(s): Despite somewhat less favorable ratings on comfort and communication, experienced EHFR and 
PAPR users still prefer reusable respirators over N95s in certain higher risk scenarios. This suggests that 
reusable respirators are an acceptable alternative to N95 respirators in health care and offer 1 viable solution 
to prevent pandemic-generated respirator shortages.

Abstract BackgroundPersonal protective equipment (PPE) is worn by workers in surgical settings to protect them and 
patients. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clears some PPE (e.g., surgical masks (SM)) as class II medical 
devices, and regulates some (e.g. surgical head cover) as class I exempt devices. For respiratory protection, 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators 
(FFRs), and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are used. One type of PPE, "surgical N95 respirators", is a 
NIOSH-approved FFR that is also cleared by the FDA for use in medical settings. The surgical environment 
poses unique risks such as the potential for surgical fires. As part of its substantial equivalence determination 
process, FDA requests testing of flammability and other parameters for SM and surgical N95 respirators. A lack 
of data regarding flammability of PPE used in healthcare exists. We hypothesize that commonly used PPE, 
regardless of whether regulated and/or cleared by FDA or not, will pass an industry standard such as the 16 
CFR 1610 flammability test.MethodsEleven N95 FFR models, eight surgical N95 respirator models, seven SM 
models, five surgical head cover models, and five PAPR hood models were evaluated for flammability with a 45 
degree flammability tester using the 16 CFR 1610 method. Three common fabrics were included for 
comparison.ResultsAll of the PPE samples regulated/and or cleared by FDA or not, passed the flammability test 
at class 1 (normal flammability), meaning they are less likely to burn. Only one of the three common fabrics, a 
cotton fabric at the lowest basis weight, was class 3 (high flammability).ConclusionsThe results obtained in the 
study suggest that NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs would likely pass the 16 CFR 1610 flammability standard. 
Moreover, results suggest that NIOSH is capable of undertaking flammability testing using the 16 CFR 1610 
standard as the flammability results NIOSH obtained for N95 FFRs were comparable to the results obtained by 
a third party independent laboratory.

Abstract N95 respirator masks are recommended for protection against respiratory viruses. Despite passing fit-testing 

10% of N95 respirator users encountered breakthroughs with exposure to influenza virus compared to full 
protection provided by a powered air purifying respirator. The current recommendation of N95 respirators 
should be evaluated for endemic and emerging scenarios.

Abstract BACKGROUNDThe aim of this study was to describe the risk of self-contamination associated with doffing of 

personal protective equipment (PPE) and to compare self-contamination with various PPE 
protocols.METHODSWe tested 10 different PPE donning and doffing protocols, recommended by various 
health organizations for Ebola. Ten participants were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to use 3 
different PPE protocols. After donning of PPE, fluorescent lotion and spray were applied on the external surface 
of the PPE to simulate contamination, and ultraviolet light was used to count fluorescent patches on the 
skin.RESULTSAfter testing 30 PPE sequences, large fluorescent patches were recorded after using "WHO 
coverall and 95" and "North Carolina coverall and N95" sequences, and small patches were recorded after using 
"CDC coverall and N95" and "Health Canada gown and N95" sequences. Commonly reported problems with 
PPE use were breathing difficulty, suffocation, heat stress, and fogging-up glasses. Most participants rated PPE 
high (18/30) or medium (11/30) for ease of donning/doffing and comfort. PPE sequences with powered air-
purifying respirators (PAPRs) and assisted doffing were generally associated with fewer problems and were 
rated the highest.CONCLUSIONThis study confirmed the risk of self-contamination associated with the doffing 
of PPE. PAPR-containing protocols and assisted doffing should be preferred whenever possible during the 
outbreak of highly infectious pathogens.

Abstract The use of respiratory protection, an important component of personal protective equipment (PPE) in 

healthcare, is dependent on the hazard and environmental conditions in the workplace. This requires the 
employer and healthcare worker (HCW) to be knowledgeable about potential exposures and their respective 
protective measures. However, the use of respirators is inconsistent in healthcare settings, potentially putting 
HCWs at risk for illness or injury. To better understand respirator use, barriers, and influences, the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Health and Safety Practices Survey of Healthcare 
Workers provided an opportunity to examine self-reported use of respirators and surgical masks for targeted 
hazards. The hazards of interest included aerosolized medications, antineoplastic drugs, chemical sterilants, 
high-level disinfectants, influenza-like illness (ILI), and surgical smoke. Of the 10,383 HCWs who reported 
respiratory protection behaviors, 1,904 (18%) reported wearing a respirator for at least one hazard. Hazard 
type, job duties, site characteristics, and organizational factors played a greater role in the likelihood of 
respirator use than individual factors. The proportion of respirator users was highest for aerosolized 
medications and lowest for chemical sterilants. Most respondents reported using a surgical mask for at least 
one of the hazards, with highest use for surgical smoke generated by electrosurgical techniques and ILI. The 
high proportion of respirator non-users who used surgical masks is concerning because HCWs may be using a 
surgical mask in situations that require a respirator, specifically for surgical smoke. Improved guidance on 
hazard recognition, risk evaluation, and appropriate respirator selection could potentially help HCWs better 
understand how to protect themselves at work.

Abstract Background: Safe and effective decontamination and reuse of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) has the 

potential to significantly extend FFR holdings, mitigating a potential shortage due to an influenza pandemic or 
other pandemic events. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be effective for 
decontaminating influenza-contaminated FFRs. This study aims to build on past research by evaluating the 
UVGI decontamination efficiency of influenza-contaminated FFRs in the presence of soiling agents using an 
optimized UVGI dose. 
Method(s): Twelve samples each of 15 N95 FFR models were contaminated with H1N1 influenza (facepiece and 
strap), then covered with a soiling agent-artificial saliva or artificial skin oil. For each soiling agent, 3 
contaminated FFRs were treated with 1 J/cm2 UVGI for approximately 1 minute, whereas 3 other contaminated 
FFRs remained untreated. All contaminated surfaces were cut out and virus extracted. Viable influenza was 
quantified using a median tissue culture infectious dose assay. 
Result(s): Significant reductions (>=3 log) in influenza viability for both soiling conditions were observed on 
facepieces from 12 of 15 FFR models and straps from 7 of 15 FFR models. 
Conclusion(s): These data suggest that FFR decontamination and reuse using UVGI can be effective. 
Implementation of a UVGI method will require careful consideration of FFR model, material type, and design.

Abstract Background: Self-contamination during the doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) has been 
considered a major risk during medical care for patients with high-consequence emerging infectious diseases 
(HCEID), such as Ebola virus disease. To prevent selfcontamination, strict adherence to the PPE doffing 
protocols is critical. We sought to evaluate the adherence of HCWs to doffing protocol and the rate of self-
contamination. 
Method(s): The study was conducted as a part of training of the dedicated response team for HCEID. HCWs 
donned PPE which consisted of a coverall, an apron, double gloves, a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), 
and shoe covers. After donning, trainees conducted various simulated activities including intubation and 
insertion of central venous catheters. Before doffing the PPE, the surface of PPE was artificially contaminated 
with fluorescent fluid. Doffing of PPE was monitored by another trainee who verbally instructed each step 
using a checklist. Performance of each step was recorded by infection preventionists. Self-contamination was 
evaluated by the visualization of fluorescent fluid on HCWs using a handheld ultraviolet light. 
Result(s): A total of 75 subjects were evaluated. At least one violation of protocol was observed in 22.7% of 
subjects. Most common violation occurred during decontamination of shoes (9.3%), followed by doffing coverall 
(8.0%), doffing shoe covers (6.7%), visual inspection for gross contamination (5.3%), doffing gloves (4.0%), 
doffing PAPR (2.7%), and hand hygiene (1.3%). Self-contamination was detected in 64.0% of subjects. The neck 
was most commonly contaminated (45.3%), followed by arms (28.0%), hands (26.7%), and the head (20.0%). No 
specific type of violation was shown to be significantly associated with self-contamination. However, all 
subjects who missed decontamination of gloves or those who failed to properly doff gloves or PAPR were 
contaminated. 
Conclusion(s): Violation of doffing protocol was common during an intensive training session. Self-
contamination was also common during PPE doffing.

Abstract Numerous changes have been made to the French labour regulations in recent years relating to the prevention 

of risks of exposure to asbestos fibres for operators removing asbestos-containing materials. These changes 
refer to the method used to count fibres, the collective and personal protective devices to be used on these 
worksites, and the occupational exposure limit value, which was reduced to 10 f.L-1 on 2 July 2015. In this 
context, this study assessed the level of respiratory protection afforded by supplied-air respirators and 
powered air-purifying respirators by monitoring exposure for several operators on nine worksites. The levels of 
dustiness measured in personal samples taken outside masks showed significant evidence of potential exposure 
during removal of asbestos-containing plaster or sprayed asbestos, and when using abrasive blasting to treat 
asbestos-containing materials. For these tasks outside concentration regularly exceeds 25000 f.L-1. 
Measurements inside masks were generally low, under 10 f.L-1, except in some situations involving the removal 
of asbestos-containing plaster. This partial penetration of fibres inside masks could be due to the high loading 
linked to this material. The distributions of Workplace Protection Factors obtained for the two types of 
respiratory protective devices studied were broad, and the fifth percentile values equal to 236 and 104, 
respectively, for supplied-air respirators and powered air-purifying respirators. This work highlights once again 
the need to prioritize collective protection when seeking to prevent asbestos-related risks.

Abstract BackgroundDoffing protocols for personal protective equipment (PPE) are critical for keeping healthcare 
workers (HCWs) safe during care of patients with Ebola virus disease. We assessed the relationship between 
errors and self-contamination during doffing.MethodsEleven HCWs experienced with doffing Ebola-level PPE 
participated in simulations in which HCWs donned PPE marked with surrogate viruses (ɸ6 and MS2), 
completed a clinical task, and were assessed for contamination after doffing. Simulations were video recorded, 
and a failure modes and effects analysis and fault tree analyses were performed to identify errors during 
doffing, quantify their risk (risk index), and predict contamination data.ResultsFifty-one types of errors were 
identified, many having the potential to spread contamination. Hand hygiene and removing the powered air 
purifying respirator (PAPR) hood had the highest total risk indexes (111 and 70, respectively) and number of 
types of errors (9 and 13, respectively). ɸ6 was detected on 10% of scrubs and the fault tree predicted a 10.4% 
contamination rate, likely occurring when the PAPR hood inadvertently contacted scrubs during removal. MS2 
was detected on 10% of hands, 20% of scrubs, and 70% of inner gloves and the predicted rates were 7.3%, 
19.4%, 73.4%, respectively. Fault trees for MS2 and ɸ6 contamination suggested similar 
pathways.ConclusionsEbola-level PPE can both protect and put HCWs at risk for self-contamination 
throughout the doffing process, even among experienced HCWs doffing with a trained observer. Human factors 
methodologies can identify error-prone steps, delineate the relationship between errors and self-
contamination, and suggest remediation strategies.

Abstract ObjectiveLoose-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are increasingly being used in healthcare. 
NIOSH has previously used advanced manikin headforms to develop methods to evaluate filtering facepiece 
respirator fit; research has now begun to develop methods to evaluate PAPR performance using headforms. 
This preliminary study investigated the performance of PAPRs at different work rates to support development 
of a manikin-based test method.MethodsManikin penetration factors (mPF) of three models of loose-fitting 
PAPRs were measured at four different work rates (REST: 11 Lpm, LOW: 25 Lpm, MODERATE: 48 Lpm, and 
HIGH: 88 Lpm) using a medium-sized NIOSH static advanced headform mounted onto a torso. In-mask 
differential pressure was monitored throughout each test. Two condensation particle counters were used to 
measure the sodium chloride aerosol concentrations in the test chamber and also inside the PAPR facepiece 
over a 2-minute sample period. Two test system configurations were evaluated for returning air to the 
headform in the exhalation cycle (filtered and unfiltered). Geometric mean (GM) and 5th percentile mPFs for 
each model/work rate combination were computed. Analysis of variance tests were used to assess the variables 
affecting mPF.ResultsPAPR model, work rate, and test configuration significantly affected PAPR performance. 
PAPR airflow rates for the three models were approximately 185, 210, and 235 Lpm. All models achieved GM 
mPFs and 5th percentile mPFs greater than their designated Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
assigned protection factors despite negative minimum pressures observed for some work rate/model 
combinations.ConclusionsPAPR model, work rate, and test configuration affect PAPR performance. Advanced 
headforms have potential for assessing PAPR performance once test methods can be matured. A manikin-based 
inward leakage test method for PAPRs can be further developed using the knowledge gained from this study. 
Future studies should vary PAPR airflow rate to better understand the effects on performance. Additional 
future research is needed to evaluate the correlation of PAPR performance using advanced headforms to the 
performance measured with human subjects.

Abstract This study investigates the effects of five decontamination methods on the filter quality (qf) of three 
commercially available electret masks-N95, Gauze and Spunlace nonwoven masks. Newly developed evaluation 
methods, the overall filter quality (qf,o) and the qf ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of 
decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the 
concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6-594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure 
drop (Δp) through the mask are used to determine qf and qf,o. Experimental results reveal that the most 
penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 
nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%. The Δp 
through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H2O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, 
exceeding the Δp values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of 
the most penetrating particles, changing the qf values of all of the masks: qf fell as particle size increased 
because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the Δp of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, 
the use of an autoclave reduces the Δp values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor 
ethanol altered the Δp of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the qf,o values for the 
three electret masks. The value of qf,o for PM0.1 exceeded that for PM0.1-0.6, because particles smaller than 
100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better qf for a given pressure drop. The values of qf,o, particularly 
for PM0.1, reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less 
destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, 
penetration should be regarded as the priority.

Abstract Twelve subjects wore an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 FFR), one tight-fitting full facepiece powered 

air-purifying respirator (PAPR), two loose-fitting PAPRs, and one elastomeric/PAPR hybrid for 1 hr each during 
treadmill walking at 5.6 km/hr while undergoing physiological and subjective response monitoring. No 
significant interaction (p ≥ .05) was noted between the five respirators in heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen 
saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide, and perceptions of breathing effort or discomfort, exertion, facial 
heat, and overall body heat. Respirator deadspace heat/humidity were significantly greater for the N95 FFR, 
whereas tympanic forehead skin temperatures were significantly greater for the hybrid PAPR. Temperature of 
the facial skin covered by the respirator was equivalent for the N95 FFR and hybrid PAPR, and both were 
significantly higher than for the other three PAPRs. Perception of eye dryness was significantly greater for a 
tight-fitting full facepiece PAPR than the N95 FFR and hybrid PAPR. At a low-moderate work rate over 1 hr, 
effects on cardiopulmonary variables, breathing perceptions, and facial and overall body heat perceptions did 
not differ significantly between the four PAPRs and a N95 FFR, but the tight-fitting, full facepiece PAPR 
increased perceptions of eye dryness. The two loose-fitting PAPRs and the full facepiece tight-fitting PAPR 
ameliorated exercise-induced increases in facial temperature, but this did not translate to improved perception 
of facial heat and overall body heat.

Abstract Background Health care facilities are considering the use of reusable respiratory protective devices (RPDs) to 
mitigate a potential N95 filtering facepiece respirator shortage caused by an influenza pandemic. US regulators 
are also considering stockpiling reusable RPDs for pandemic preparedness, but limited data exist on the 
effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection of these devices. This study defines reprocessing protocols and 
evaluates their effectiveness against a pandemic influenza strain in a laboratory setting. Methods Five half-
mask elastomeric respirator models and 3 powered air-purifying respirator models were contaminated with 
influenza virus and artificial skin oil on multiple surfaces. RPDs were then manually treated with 1 of 2 methods: 
cleaned or cleaned and disinfected. Presence of viable influenza was determined via swab sampling and a 
median tissue culture infectious dose assay. Results Across 41 RPD surfaces, a mean log reduction in viable 
influenza of 4.54 +/- 0.97 log10 median tissue culture infectious dose was achieved for all treated surfaces, 
which included both cleaned and cleaned and disinfected surfaces. Conclusions The methods defined as part of 
this study are effective for eliminating viable influenza in the presence of artificial skin oil on most of the RPD 
surfaces tested. Material type and RPD design should be considered when implementing RPD reprocessing 
protocols.

Abstract Aerosolized pathogens are a leading cause of respiratory infection and transmission. Currently used protective 
measures pose potential risk of primary/secondary infection and transmission. Here, we report the 
development of a universal, reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the main fibrous 
filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium chloride salt. The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon 
exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly 
sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration 
layer, and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. 
Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare 
filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and 
following storage in harsh environmental conditions. Our results can be applied in obtaining a broad-spectrum, 
airborne pathogen prevention device in preparation for epidemic and pandemic of respiratory diseases.

Abstract The objective of this study was to investigate the protection level offered by a Powered Air-Purifying 

Respirator (PAPR) equipped with an improperly sized or stretched-out loose-fitting facepiece using constant 
and cyclic flow conditions. Improperly sized PAPR facepieces of two models as well as a stretched-out facepiece 
were tested. These facepieces were examined in two versions: with and without exhaust holes. Loose-fitting 
facepieces (size "large") were donned on a small manikin headform and challenged with sodium chloride (NaCl) 
aerosol particles in an exposure chamber. Four cyclic flows with mean inspiratory flows (MIFs) of 30, 55, 85, and 
135 L/min were applied using an electromechanical Breathing Recording and Simulation System (BRSS). The 
manikin Fit Factor (mFF) was determined as the ratio of aerosol concentrations outside (Cout) to inside (Cin) of 
the facepiece, measured with a P-Trak condensation particle counter (CPC). Results showed that the mFF 
decreased exponentially with increasing MIF. The mFF values of the stretched-out facepiece were significantly 
lower than those obtained for the undamaged ones. Facepiece type and MIF were found to significantly affect 
the performance of the loose-fitting PAPR. The effect of the exhaust holes was less pronounced and depended 
on the facepiece type. It was concluded that an improperly sized facepiece might potentially offer relatively low 
protection (mFF < 250) at high to strenuous workloads. The testing was also performed at a constant inhalation 
flow to explore the mechanism of the particle-facepiece interaction. Results obtained with cyclic flow pattern 
were consistent with the data generated when testing the loose-fitting PAPR under constant flow conditions. 
The time-weighted average values of mFF calculated from the measurements conducted under the constant 
flow regime were capable of predicting the protection under cyclic flow regime. The findings suggest that 
program administrators need to equip employees with properly sized facepieces and remove stretched-out 
ones from workplace. Manufacturers should emphasize the importance of proper sizing with their user 
instructions.

Abstract International travel and infectious respiratory illnesses worldwide place health care workers (HCWs) at 

increasing risk of respiratory exposures. To ensure the highest quality safety initiatives, one health care system 
used a quality improvement model of Plan-Do-Study-Act and guidance from Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration's (OSHA) May 2015 Hospital Respiratory Protection Program (RPP) Toolkit to assess a current 
program. The toolkit aided in identification of opportunities for improvement within their well-designed RPP. 
One opportunity was requiring respirator use during aerosol-generating procedures for specific infectious 
illnesses. Observation data demonstrated opportunities to mitigate controllable risks including strap 
placement, user seal check, and reuse of disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators. Subsequent 
interdisciplinary collaboration resulted in other ideas to decrease risks and increase protection from potentially 
infectious respiratory illnesses. The toolkit's comprehensive document to evaluate the program showed that 
while the OSHA standards have not changed, the addition of the toolkit can better protect HCWs.

Abstract An online questionnaire was developed to explore respiratory protective device (RPD) prevalence in U.S. health 
care facilities. The survey was distributed to professional nursing society members in 2014 and again in 2015 
receiving 322 and 232 participant responses, respectively. The purpose of this study was to explore if the 
emergency preparedness climate associated with Ebola virus disease changed the landscape of RPD use and 
awareness. Comparing response percentages from the two sampling time frames using bivariate analysis, no 
significant changes were found in types of RPDs used in health care settings. N95 filtering facepiece respirators 
continue to be the most prevalent RPD used in health care facilities, but powered air-purifying respirators are 
also popular, with regional use highest in the West and Midwest. Understanding RPD use prevalence could 
ensure that health care workers receive appropriate device trainings as well as improve supply matching for 
emergency RPD stockpiling.

Abstract BACKGROUNDIn epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or SARS, 
healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their 
contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Contact precautions by means of personal protective 
equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to 
remove PPE, and how to make sure HCWs use PPE as instructed.OBJECTIVESTo evaluate which type or 
component of full-body PPE and which method of donning or removing (doffing) PPE have the least risk of self-
contamination or infection for HCWs, and which training methods most increase compliance with PPE 
protocols.SEARCH METHODSWe searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 8 January 2016), Cochrane Central 
Register of Trials (CENTRAL up to 20 January 2016), EMBASE (embase.com up to 8 January 2016), CINAHL 
(EBSCOhost up to 20 January 2016), and OSH-Update up to 8 January 2016. We also screened reference lists 
of included trials and relevant reviews, and contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE.SELECTION 
CRITERIAWe included all eligible controlled studies that compared the effect of types or components of PPE in 
HCWs exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, such as EVD and SARS, on the risk of 
infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included studies that simulated contamination 
with fluorescent markers or a non-pathogenic virus.We also included studies that compared the effect of 
various ways of donning or removing PPE, and the effects of various types of training in PPE use on the same 
outcomes.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSISTwo authors independently selected studies, extracted data and 
assessed risk of bias in included trials. We intended to perform meta-analyses but we did not find sufficiently 
similar studies to combine their results.MAIN RESULTSWe included nine studies with 1200 participants 
evaluating ten interventions. Of these, eight trials simulated the exposure with a fluorescent marker or virus or 
bacteria containing fluids. Five studies evaluated different types of PPE against each other but two did not 
report sufficient data. Another two studies compared different types of donning and doffing and three studies 
evaluated the effect of different types of training.None of the included studies reported a standardised 
classification of the protective properties against viral penetration of the PPE, and only one reported the brand 
of PPE used. None of the studies were conducted with HCWs exposed to EVD but in one study participants 
were exposed to SARS. Different types of PPE versus each otherIn simulation studies, contamination rates 
varied from 25% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study, PPE made of more breathable 
material did not lead to a statistically significantly different number of spots with contamination but did have 
greater user satisfaction (Mean Difference (MD) -0.46 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.84 to -0.08, range 1 to 
5, very low quality evidence). In another study, gowns protected better than aprons. In yet another study, the 
use of a powered air-purifying respirator protected better than a now outdated form of PPE. There were no 
studies on goggles versus face shields, on long- versus short-sleeved gloves, or on the use of taping PPE parts 
together. Different methods of donning and doffing procedures versus each otherTwo cross-over simulation 
studies (one RCT, one CCT) compared different methods for donning and doffing against each other. Double 
gloving led to less contamination compared to single gloving (Relative Risk (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78, very 
low quality evidence) in one simulation study, but not to more noncompliance with guidance (RR 1.08; 95% CI 
0.70 to 1.67, very low quality evidence). Following CDC recommendations for doffing led to less contamination 
in another study (very low quality evidence). There were no studies on the use of disinfectants while doffing. 
Different types of training versus each otherIn one study, the use of additional computer simulation led to less 
errors in doffing (MD -1.2, 95% CI -1.6 to -0.7) and in another study additional spoken instruction led to less 
errors (MD -0.9, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.4). One retrospective cohort study assessed the effect of active training - 
defined as face-to-face instruction - versus passive training - defined as folders or videos - on noncompliance 
with PPE use and on noncompliance with doffing guidance. Active training did not considerably reduce 
noncompliance in PPE use (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.30) but reduced noncompliance with doffing 
procedures (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98, very low quality evidence). There were no studies on how to retain 
the results of training in the long term or on resource use.The quality of the evidence was very low for all 
comparisons because of high risk of bias in studies, indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants. 
This means that it is likely that the true effect can be substantially different from the one reported 
here.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONSWe found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may 
not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. We also found very low quality 
evidence that double gloving and CDC doffing guidance appear to decrease the risk of contamination and that 
more active training in PPE use may reduce PPE and doffing errors more than passive training. However, the 
data all come from single studies with high risk of bias and we are uncertain about the estimates of effects.We 
need simulation studies conducted with several dozens of participants, preferably using a non-pathogenic virus, 
to find out which type and combination of PPE protects best, and what is the best way to remove PPE. We also 
need randomised controlled studies of the effects of one type of training versus another to find out which 
training works best in the long term. HCWs exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their use of PPE 
registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection.

Abstract OBJECTIVEIn this study, we aimed to describe the processes of both the donning and the doffing of personal 

protective equipment for Ebola and evaluate contamination during the doffing process.METHODSWe 
recruited study participants among physicians and nurses of the emergency department of Samsung Medical 
Center in Seoul, Korea. Participants were asked to carry out doffing and donning procedures with a helper after 
a 50-minute brief training and demonstration based on the 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
protocol. Two separate cameras with high-density capability were set up, and the donning and doffing processes 
were video-taped. A trained examiner inspected all video recordings and coded for intervals, errors, and 
contaminations defined as the outside of the equipment touching the clinician's body surface.RESULTSOverall, 
29 participants were enrolled. Twenty (68.9%) were female, and the mean age was 29.2 years. For the donning 
process, the average interval until the end was 234.2 seconds (standard deviation [SD], 65.7), and the most 
frequent errors occurred when putting on the outer gloves (27.5%), respirator (20.6%), and hood (20.6%). For 
the doffing process, the average interval until the end was 183.7 seconds (SD, 38.4), and the most frequent 
errors occurred during disinfecting the feet (37.9%), discarding the scrubs (17.2%), and putting on gloves 
(13.7%), respectively. During the doffing process, 65 incidences of contamination occurred (2.2 incidents/
person). The most vulnerable processes were removing respirators (79.2%), removing the shoe covers (65.5%), 
and removal of the hood (41.3%).CONCLUSIONA significant number of contaminations occur during the 
doffing process of personal protective equipment.

Abstract While influenza transmission is thought to occur primarily by droplet spread, the role of airborne spread 

remains uncertain. Understanding the beliefs and attitudes of infectious disease physicians regarding influenza 
transmission and respiratory and barrier protection preferences can provide insights into workplace decisions 
regarding respiratory protection planning. Physicians participating in the Infectious Diseases Society of 
America's Emerging Infections Network were queried in November 2013 to determine beliefs and attitudes on 
influenza transmission. A subset of physicians involved in their facility's respiratory protection decision making 
were queried about respirator and surgical mask choices under various pandemic scenarios; availability of, and 
challenges associated with, respirators in their facility; and protective strategies during disposable N95 
shortages. The majority of 686 respondents (98%) believed influenza transmission occurs frequently or 
occasionally via droplets; 44% of respondents believed transmission occurs via small particles frequently (12%) 
or occasionally (32%). Among the subset of respondents involved in respiratory protection planning at their 
facility, over 90% preferred surgical masks during provision of non-aerosol-generating patient care for seasonal 
influenza. However, for the same type of care during an influenza pandemic, two-thirds of respondents opted 
for disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators. In settings where filtering facepiece (disposable) N95 
respirators were in short supply, preferred conservation strategies included extended use and reuse of 
disposable N95s. Use of reusable (elastomeric facepiece) respirator types was viewed less favorably. While 
respondents identified droplets as the primary mode of influenza transmission, during a high-severity pandemic 
scenario there was increased support for devices that reduced aerosol-based transmission. Use of potentially 
less familiar respirator types may partially relieve shortages of disposable N95s but also may require significant 
education efforts so that clinicians are aware of the characteristics of alternative personal protective 
equipment.

Abstract Background This was a feasibility study in a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center to develop a 

standard operating procedure (SOP) to be used by health care workers to disinfect reusable elastomeric 
respirators under pandemic conditions. Registered and licensed practical nurses, nurse practitioners, aides, 
clinical technicians, and physicians took part in the study. Methods Health care worker volunteers were 
provided with manufacturers' cleaning and disinfection instructions and all necessary supplies. They were 
observed and filmed. SOPs were developed, based on these observations, and tested on naive volunteer health 
care workers. Error rates using manufacturers' instructions and SOPs were compared. Results When using 
respirator manufacturers' cleaning and disinfection instructions, without specific training or supervision, all 
subjects made multiple errors. When using the SOPs developed in the study, without specific training or 
guidance, naive health care workers disinfected respirators with zero errors. Conclusion Reusable facial 
protective equipment may be disinfected by health care workers with minimal training using SOPs.

Abstract The present outbreak of Ebola has health care professionals seeking guidance on isolation precautions for 
routine care and aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). The most recent guidelines state that during AGPs, 
health care professionals should wear respiratory protection at least as protective as a National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health-certified fit tested N95 filtering face piece respirator or higher; for example, a 
powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR). The present review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of 
using a PAPR versus an N95 mask, and relates the experience of the Jewish General Hospital (Montreal, 
Quebec) of PAPR policy implementation. Training programs on proper donning and doffing of personal 
protective equipment and quality control systems need to be in place. Respiratory therapists are frontline 
during AGPs and need to be active in the decision making of the type of equipment chosen to protect them.

Abstract Public health organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are increasingly 
recommending the use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) in health care settings. For infection control 
purposes, the usual practice is to discard FFRs after close contact with a patient ("single use"). However, in some 
situations, such as during contact with tuberculosis patients, limited FFR reuse (i.e., repeated donning and 
doffing of the same FFR by the same person) is practiced. A related practice, extended use, involves wearing the 
same FFR for multiple patient encounters without doffing. Extended use and limited FFR reuse have been 
recommended during infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics to conserve FFR supplies. This commentary 
examines CDC recommendations related to FFR extended use and limited reuse and analyzes available data 
from the literature to provide a relative estimate of the risks of these practices compared to single use. Analysis 
of the available data and the use of disease transmission models indicate that decisions regarding whether FFR 
extended use or reuse should be recommended should continue to be pathogen- and event-specific. Factors to 
be included in developing the recommendations are the potential for the pathogen to spread via contact 
transmission, the potential that the event could result in or is currently causing a FFR shortage, the protection 
provided by FFR use, human factors, potential for self-inoculation, the potential for secondary exposures, and 
government policies and regulations. While recent findings largely support the previous recommendations for 
extended use and limited reuse in certain situations, some new cautions and limitations should be considered 
before issuing recommendations in the future. In general, extended use of FFRs is preferred over limited FFR 
reuse. Limited FFR reuse would allow the user a brief respite from extended wear times, but increases the risk 
of self-inoculation and preliminary data from one study suggest that some FFR models may begin to lose 
effectiveness after multiple donnings.

Abstract UNLABELLEDWhen selecting a respirator, it is important to understand how employees' motor, visual and 

cognitive abilities are impacted by the personal protective equipment. This study compares dust, powered-air-
purifying and full-face, negative-pressure respirators. Thirty participants performed three varied tasks. Each 
participant performed each task without a respirator and while wearing the three respirator types. The tasks 
included a hand tool dexterity test, the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test and the Serial Sevens Test to 
evaluate fine motor, visual and cognitive performance, respectively. The time required for task completion and 
the errors made were measured. Analysis showed no significant effect due to respirator use on the task 
completion time. A significant increase was found in the error rate when participants performed the cognitive 
test wearing the full-face, negative-pressure respirator. Participants had varying respirator preferences. They 
indicated a potential for full-face, negative-pressure respirators to negatively affect jobs demanding high 
cognitive skills such as problem solving and decision-making.PRACTITIONER SUMMARYwhile respirators are 
life-saving personal protective equipment (PPE), they can unintentionally reduce human performance, 
especially if job characteristics are not considered during PPE selection. An experiment was conducted to 
compare three respirators (dust respirator, powered-air-purifying respirators and full-face respirator) for 
varying task types. The full-face respirator was found to affect human cognitive performance negatively.

Abstract Currently there is an ongoing debate and limited evidence on the use of masks and respirators for the 
prevention of respiratory infections in health care workers (HCWs). This study aimed to examine available 
policies and guidelines around the use of masks and respirators in HCWs and to describe areas of consistency 
between guidelines, as well as gaps in the recommendations, with reference to the WHO and the CDC 
guidelines. Policies and guidelines related to mask and respirator use for the prevention of influenza, SARS and 
TB were examined. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), three high-income countries and six low/middle-income countries were selected. Uniform 
recommendations are made by the WHO and the CDC in regards to protecting HCWs against seasonal 
influenza (a mask for low risk situations and a respirator for high risk situations) and TB (use of a respirator). 
However, for pandemic influenza and SARS, the WHO recommends mask use in low risk and respirators in high 
risk situations, whereas, the CDC recommends respirators in both low and high risk situations. Amongst the 
nine countries reviewed, there are variations in the recommendations for all three diseases. While, some 
countries align with the WHO recommendations, others align with those made by the CDC. The choice of 
respirator and the level of filtering ability vary amongst the guidelines and the different diseases. Lastly, none of 
the policies discuss reuse, extended use or the use of cloth masks. Currently, there are significant variations in 
the policies and recommendations around mask and respirator use for protection against influenza, SARS and 
TB. These differences may reflect the scarcity of level-one evidence available to inform policy development. The 
lack of any guidelines on the use of cloth masks, despite widespread use in many low and middle-income 
countries, remains a policy gap. Health organizations and countries should jointly evaluate the available 
evidence, prioritize research to inform evidence gaps, and develop consistent policy on masks and respirator 
use in the health care setting.

Abstract BACKGROUNDA concern with reuse of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 

filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) is that multiple donnings could stress FFR components, impairing fit. This 
study investigated the impact of multiple donnings on the facepiece fit of 6 N95 FFR models using a group of 10 
experienced test subjects per model.METHODSThe TSI PORTACOUNT Plus and N95 Companion accessory 
were used for all tests. After qualifying by passing a standard Occupational Safety and Health Administration fit 
test, subjects performed up to 20 consecutive tests on an individual FFR sample using a modified protocol. 
Regression analyses were performed for the percentage of donnings resulting in fit factors (FFs) ≥100 for all 6 
FFR models combined.RESULTSRegression analyses showed statistical significance for donning groups 1-10, 
1-15, and 1-20. The mean percentage of donnings with an FF ≥100 was 81%-93% for donning group 1-5, but 
dropped to 53%-75% for donning group 16-20.CONCLUSIONSOur results show that multiple donnings had a 
model-dependent impact on fit for the 6 N95 models evaluated. The data suggest that 5 consecutive donnings 
can be performed before FFs consistently drop below 100.

Abstract Filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are recommended for use as precautions against airborne pathogenic 
microorganisms; however, during pandemics demand for FFRs may far exceed availability. Reuse of FFRs 
following decontamination has been proposed but few reported studies have addressed the feasibility. 
Concerns regarding biocidal efficacy, respirator performance post decontamination, decontamination cost, and 
user safety have impeded adoption of reuse measures. This study examined the effectiveness of three energetic 
decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), microwave-generated steam, and moist 
heat] on two National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-certified N95 FFRs (3M models 1860s and 
1870) contaminated with H5N1. An aerosol settling chamber was used to apply virus-laden droplets to FFRs in 
a method designed to simulate respiratory deposition of droplets onto surfaces. When FFRs were examined 
post decontamination by viral culture, all three decontamination methods were effective, reducing virus load by 
> 4 log median tissue culture infective dose. Analysis of treated FFRs using a quantitative molecular 
amplification assay (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction) indicated that UVGI decontamination 
resulted in lower levels of detectable viral RNA than the other two methods. Filter performance was evaluated 
before and after decontamination using a 1% NaCl aerosol. As all FFRs displayed <5% penetration by 300-nm 
particles, no profound reduction in filtration performance was caused in the FFRs tested by exposure to virus 
and subsequent decontamination by the methods used. These findings indicate that, when properly 
implemented, these methods effectively decontaminate H5N1 on the two FFR models tested and do not 
drastically affect their filtering function; however, other considerations may influence decisions to reuse FFRs.

Abstract A combination of local flow measurement techniques and fog flow visualization was used to determine the 
inward leakage for two tight-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), the 3M Breathe-Easy PAPR and 
the SE 400 breathing demand PAPR. The PAPRs were mounted on a breathing machine head form, and flows 
were measured from the blower and into the breathing machine. Both respirators leaked a little at the 
beginning of inhalation, probably through their exhalation valves. In both cases, the leakage was not enough for 
fog to appear at the mouth of the head form.

Abstract Reuse of organic vapor air-purifying respirator cartridges after a job or shift can provide economy and energy 

savings. However, standards and manufacturers' guidance discourage reuse, presumably due to a lack of 
quantitative objective exposure and use information. Storage and simulated reuse laboratory studies and 
modeling have been done to provide such information. Two important parameters of breakthrough curves, 
midpoint time (related to adsorption capacity) and midpoint slope (related to adsorption rate), have been shown 
to be unchanged during storage for reuse. Extrapolations to smaller breakthrough concentrations and times can 
be made from this reference breakthrough and time. Significant step increases in breakthrough concentration 
upon cartridge reuse have been observed in some cases. Values of immediate breakthrough concentrations 
upon reuse (IBURs) have been measured and correlated. The Dubinin/Radushkevich adsorption isotherm 
equation has been used to estimate maximum IBURs, which depend on many factors, including conditions and 
duration of first use. An empirical equation describing rate of approach to maximum IBUR as a function of 
storage time has been developed to provide intermediate IBUR estimates, which are also very dependent on 
the vapor identity and extent of first-use loading. Using these equations, IBUR estimates with appropriate 
safety factors can be compared with the allowable breakthrough concentration to help the Industrial Hygienist 
make reusability decisions.

Abstract The objective of this study was to determine if ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), moist heat incubation 

(MHI), or microwave-generated steam (MGS) decontamination affects the fitting characteristics, odor, comfort, 
or donning ease of six N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) models. For each model, 10 experienced test 
subjects qualified for the study by passing a standard OSHA quantitative fit test. Once qualified, each subject 
performed a series of fit tests to assess respirator fit and completed surveys to evaluate odor, comfort, and 
donning ease with FFRs that were not decontaminated (controls) and with FFRs of the same model that had 
been decontaminated. Respirator fit was quantitatively measured using a multidonning protocol with the TSI 
PORTACOUNT Plus and the N95 Companion accessory (designed to count only particles resulting from face to 
face-seal leakage). Participants' subjective appraisals of the respirator's odor, comfort, and donning ease were 
captured using a visual analog scale survey. Wilcoxon signed rank tests compared median values for fit, odor, 
comfort, and donning ease for each FFR and decontamination method against their respective controls for a 
given model. Two of the six FFRs demonstrated a statistically significant reduction (p < 0.05) in fit after MHI 
decontamination. However, for these two FFR models, post-decontamination mean fit factors were still ≥ 100. 
One of the other FFRs demonstrated a relatively small though statistically significant increase (p < 0.05) in 
median odor response after MHI decontamination. These data suggest that FFR users with characteristics 
similar to those in this study population would be unlikely to experience a clinically meaningful reduction in fit, 
increase in odor, increase in discomfort, or increased difficulty in donning with the six FFRs included in this 
study after UVGI, MHI, or MGS decontamination. Further research is needed before decontamination of N95 
FFRs for purposes of reuse can be recommended.

Abstract AIMSTo develop a method to assess model-specific parameters for ultraviolet-C (UV-C, 254 nm) 
decontamination of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs).METHODS AND RESULTSUV-C transmittance was 
quantified for the distinct composite layers of six N95 FFR models and used to calculate model-specific α-
values, the percentage of the surface UV-C irradiance available for the internal filtering medium (IFM). Circular 
coupons, excised from the FFRs, were exposed to aerosolized particles containing MS2 coliphage and treated 
with IFM-specific UV-C doses ranging from 38 to 4707 J m(-2). Models exposed to a minimum IFM dose of 1000 
J m(-2) demonstrated at least a 3 log reduction (LR) in viable MS2. Model-specific exposure times to achieve this 
IFM dose ranged from 2 to 266 min.CONCLUSIONSUV-C transmits into and through FFR materials. LR of MS2 
was a function of model-specific IFM UV-C doses.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDYFiltering 
facepiece respirators are in high demand during infectious disease outbreaks, potentially leading to supply 
shortages. Reuse of disposable FFRs after decontamination has been discussed as a possible remediation 
strategy, but to date lacks supporting scientific evidence. The methods described here can be used to assess the 
likelihood that UV-C decontamination will be successful for specific FFR models.

Abstract Virulent respiratory infectious diseases may present a life-threatening risk for health care professionals during 
aerosol-generating procedures, including endotracheal intubation. The 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 
brings this concern to the immediate forefront. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have stated 
that, when performing or participating in aerosol-generating procedures on patients with virulent contagious 
respiratory diseases, health care professionals must wear a minimum of the N95 respirator, and they may wish 
to consider using the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR). For influenza and other diseases transmitted by 
both respiratory and contact modes, protective respirators must be combined with contact precautions. The 
PAPR provides 2.5 to 100 times greater protection than the N95, when used within the context of an 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration-compliant respiratory protection program. The relative 
protective capability of a respirator is quantified using the assigned protection factor. The level of protection 
designated by the APF can only be achieved with appropriate training and correct use of the respirator. Face 
seal leakage limits the protective capability of the N95 respirator, and fit testing does not assure the ability to 
maintain a tight face seal. The protective capability of the PAPR will be defeated by improper handling of 
contaminated equipment, incorrect assembly and maintenance, and improper don (put on) and doff (take off) 
procedures. Stress, discomfort, and physical encumbrance may impair performance. Acclimatization through 
training will mitigate these effects. Training in the use of PAPRs in advance of their need is strongly advised. 
"Just in time" training is unlikely to provide adequate preparation for groups of practitioners requiring 
specialized personal protective equipment during a pandemic. Employee health departments in hospitals may 
not presently have a PAPR training program in place. Anesthesia and critical care providers would be well 
advised to take the lead in working with their hospitals' employee health departments to establish a PAPR 
training program where none exists. User instructions state that the PAPR should not be used during surgery 
because it generates positive outward airflow, and may increase the risk of wound infection. Clarification of this 
prohibition and acceptable solutions are currently lacking and need to be addressed. The surgical hood system 
is not an acceptable alternative. We provide on line a PAPR training workshop. Supporting information is 
presented here. Anesthesia and critical care providers may use this workshop to supplement, but not substitute 
for, the manufacturers' detailed use and maintenance instructions.

Abstract The N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) is commonly used to protect individuals from infectious aerosols. 

Health care experts predict a shortage of N95 FFRs if a severe pandemic occurs, and an option that has been 
suggested for mitigating such an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the devices. Before the 
effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be 
measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and 
toxicity to the end user post treatment. This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created 
or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies. 
Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small 
enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL). Toxic by-products were 
also evaluated, and two suspected toxins were detected after ethylene oxide treatment of FFR rubber straps. 
The results provide encouragement to efforts promoting the evolution of effective strategies for 
decontamination and reuse of FFRs.

Abstract BACKGROUNDElastomeric air-purifying respirators offer the benefit of reusability, but their physiological 
impact on health care workers is unknown.METHODSTen health care workers exercised at 2 health care-
associated work rates wearing an elastomeric air-purifying respirator. Mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator 
dead space gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide) were sampled, and physiological parameters were monitored (heart 
rate, breathing rate, tidal volume, minute volume, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous carbon dioxide). 
Numerical rating scales were used to evaluate comfort and exertion.RESULTSCompared with controls (no 
respirator), significant decreases in the breathing rate at both work rates (P < .05) and increases in tidal volume 
at the lower work rate (P < .01) were noted with respirator use. Approximately half the subjects had 
transcutaneous carbon dioxide levels above the upper limit of normal after 1 hour of use. Although well 
tolerated, comfort was negatively impacted by elastomeric air-purifying respirators 
wear.CONCLUSIONReusable elastomeric air-purifying respirators impose little additional physiological burden 
over the course of 1 hour at usual health care work rates. However, the potential for carbon dioxide retention in 
a significant proportion of users exists and requires further investigation.

Abstract This study sought to determine the level of communication interference associated with commonly used 

disposable and reusable respirators and surgical masks worn by healthcare workers. Speech intelligibility was 
assessed using the modified rhyme test in an intensive care unit environment. Respirators decreased speech 
intelligibility by a range of 1% to 17%, although not all were statistically significant. Differences in speech 
intelligibility associated with surgical masks and disposable filtering facepiece respirators (without exhalation 
valves) were not statistically significant compared with controls. Wearing half-face elastomeric respirators with 
voice augmentation equipment was associated with higher speech intelligibility than models without this 
equipment (OR = 2.81). Hearing clarity while wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) was 79% 
compared with 90% with no PAPR (OR = 0.40). While some respirators appear to have little or no effect on 
speech intelligibility, interference with speech intelligibility associated with certain types of respirators 
commonly worn by U.S. healthcare workers may be substantial.

Abstract Concerns have been raised regarding the availability of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 
(NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during an influenza pandemic. One possible 
strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to 
render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination 
methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods 
[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven 
irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, 
surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future 
research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes 
in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow 
resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) 
were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the 
respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the 
decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples 
from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of 
filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following 
overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when 
rehydrated with deionized water. UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising 
decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. 
Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.

Abstract BACKGROUNDAdvanced life support of patients contaminated with chemical, biological, radiological or 
nuclear (CBRN) substances requires adequate respiratory protection for medical first responders. 
Conventional and powered air-purifying respirators may exert a different impact during resuscitation and 
therefore require evaluation. This will help to improve major incident planning and measures for protecting 
medical staff.METHODSA randomised crossover study was undertaken to investigate the influence of 
conventional negative pressure and powered air-purifying respirators on the simulated resuscitation of 
casualties contaminated with hazardous substances. Fourteen UK paramedics carried out a standardised 
resuscitation algorithm inside an ambulance vehicle, either unprotected or wearing a conventional or a 
powered respirator. Treatment times, wearer mobility, ease of communication and ease of breathing were 
determined and compared.RESULTSIn the questionnaire, volunteers stated that communication and mobility 
were similar in both respirator groups while breathing resistance was significantly lower in the powered 
respirator group. There was no difference in mean (SD) treatment times between the groups wearing 
respiratory protection and the controls (245 (19) s for controls, 247 (17) s for conventional respirators and 250 
(12) s for powered respirators).CONCLUSIONSPowered air-purifying respirators improve the ease of breathing 
and do not appear to reduce mobility or delay treatment during a simulated resuscitation scenario inside an 
ambulance vehicle with a single CBRN casualty.

Abstract OBJECTIVEWe sought to assess the knowledge of, use of and barriers to the use of personal protective 
equipment for airway management among emergency medical technicians (EMTs) during and since the 2003 
Canadian outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).METHODSUsing a cross-sectional survey, 
EMTs in Toronto, Ont., were surveyed 1 year after the SARS outbreak during mandatory training on the use of 
personal protective equipment in airway management during the outbreak and just before taking the survey. 
Practices that were addressed reflected government directives on the use of this equipment. Main outcome 
measures included the frequency of personal protective equipment use and, as applicable, why particular items 
were not always used.RESULTSThe response rate was 67.3% (n = 230). During the SARS outbreak, an N95-type 
particulate respirator was reported to be always used by 91.5% of respondents. Conversely, 72.9% of the 
respondents reported that they never used the open face hood. Equipment availability and vision impairment 
were often cited as impediments to personal protective equipment use. In nonoutbreak conditions, only the 
antimicrobial airway filter was most often reported to be always used (52.0%), while other items were used at 
an intermediate frequency. The most common reason for not always donning equipment was that paramedics 
deemed it unnecessary for the situation.CONCLUSIONPersonal protective equipment is not consistently 
employed as per medical directives. Reasons given for nonuse included nonavailability, judgment of 
nonnecessity or technical difficulties. There are important public health implications of noncompliance.

Abstract OBJECTIVETo determine if using an N95 filtering face-piece respirator concurrently with a loose-fitting 

powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) offers additional protection to the wearer.METHODSWe used a 
breathing mannequin programmed to deliver minute volumes of 25 L/min and 40 L/min. We measured the 
baseline protection factor of the PAPR with its motor operational and then deactivated (to simulate mechanical 
or battery failure). We tested 3 replicates of 3 different N95 models. We glued each N95 to the breathing 
mannequin and obtained a minimum protection factor of 100 at 25 L/min. We then placed the PAPR on the 
mannequin and took protection factor measurements with the N95-plus-PAPR combination, at 25 L/min and 40 
L/min, with the PAPR operational and then deactivated.RESULTSThe N95 significantly increased the PAPR's 
protection factor, even with the PAPR deactivated. The effect was multiplicative, not merely 
additive.CONCLUSIONSAn N95 decreases the concentration of airborne particles inspired by the wearer of a 
PAPR.

Abstract This study evaluated the workplace performance of a hood-style supplied-air respirator during aircraft sanding 
operations. Air samples were collected inside and outside the respirators worn by workers during normal work 
activities. The samples were analyzed for chromium, strontium, and magnesium. These contaminants were not 
detected on any inside sample from the valid sample sets. Program protection factors (PPFs) were estimated for 
the valid sample sets using the limit of detection as the inside sample mass. When it was possible, PPF estimates 
were made using each element individually and a combination of all three elements. The PPF estimates were in 
the range of >11000 to >65000 regardless of the elements used in the calculation. Examination of the PPF 
estimates for different elements reveals the differences are largely artificial. The results indicate the tested 
respirator performed well above its assigned protection factor of 1000. No worker was overexposed to 
chromium, strontium, or magnesium during the study. This study also illustrates the difficulty in locating 
workplaces with sufficient contaminant concentration and duration to measure the capabilities of high-
performing respirators.

Abstract Leakage from loose-fitting PAPRs (powered air-purifying respirators) can compromise the safety of wearers. 

The Martindale Centurion MAX multifunction PAPR is a loose-fitting PAPR that also incorporates head, eye, 
and ear protection. This respirator is used in mines where coal dust usually is controlled by ventilation systems. 
Should the respirator be depended on for significant respiratory protection? Ten human volunteers were asked 
to wear the Centurion MAX inside a fog-filled chamber. Their inhalation flow rates were measured with small 
pitot-tube flowmeters held inside their mouths. They were video imaged while they breathed deeply, and the 
points at which the fog reached their mouths were determined. Results showed that an average of 1.1 L could 
be inhaled before contaminated air reached the mouth. As long as the blower purges contamination from inside 
the face piece during exhalation, the 1.1 L acts as a buffer against contaminants leaked due to overbreathing of 
blower flow rate.

Abstract The concurrent use of N95 filtering facepiece respirators with powered air-purifying respirators during 

aerosol-generating medical procedures in patients with severe respiratory pathogens has been promoted as 
offering additional protection against infectious agents. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of 
this additional respiratory equipment upon protection and personal performance. The presumed additive 
protective effect of an N95 filtering facepiece respirator used concurrently with a powered air-purifying 
respirator has not been subjected to rigorous scientific investigation. The burden imposed by additional 
respiratory protective equipment should not be discounted, and the potentially minor contribution to 
protection may be offset by the negative impact on personal performance. Novel uses of protective equipment 
occasionally are spawned during crisis situations, but their generalized applicability to healthcare workers 
should ultimately be evidence-based.

Abstract Maintenance of a safe and stable health care infrastructure is critical to an effective mass casualty disaster 
response. Both secondary contamination during chemical disasters and hospital-associated infections during 
epidemic illness can pose substantial threats to achieving this goal. Understanding basic principles of 
decontamination and infection control during responses to chemical and biologic disasters can help minimize 
the risks to patients and health care workers. Effective decontamination following toxic chemical exposure 
should include both removal of contaminated clothing and decontamination of the victim's skin. Wet 
decontamination is the most feasible strategy in a mass casualty situation and should be performed promptly by 
trained personnel. In the event of an epidemic, infection prevention and control measures are based on 
essential principles of hand hygiene and standard precautions. Expanded precautions should be instituted as 
needed to target contact, droplet, and airborne routes of infectious disease transmission. Specific equipment 
and measures for critical care delivery may serve to decrease risk to health care workers in the event of an 
epidemic. Their use should be considered in developing comprehensive disaster response plans.

Abstract The positive pressure powered air-filter protective hood can prevent physicians and nurses from being infected 

by serious respiratory infections. The contaminated air is filtered by the high efficiency specific air-filter (HESA) 
and then transported into the hood by a blower to form about 140 +/- 10 Pa positive pressure environment, 
which makes the air in hood overflow out from the lower part of the hood, by which carbon dioxide and vapor 
can be removed, and excreted. The HESA's filters of simulative virus up to 99.9999% with the structure of 
double layers filtering. With going at 4 km/h pace on a walking vehicle wearing the hood, the testees' heart rate 
is 90-105/min oxygen saturation of the blood(SPO2) is 97%-98%. When the air flow is from 75 L/min to 125 L/
min, this can meet the testees' physiological demand under heavy workload. Clinical trial results show that the 
hood can effectively protect the physicians and nurses from infection.

Abstract A study protocol was developed to obtain simulated workplace protection factor (SWPF) data for eleven 

models of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) and supplied-air respirators (SAR) with hoods and helmets. 
Respirators were tested in a chamber that allowed the simulation of 12 exercises, including 2 exercises of 
interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Each respirator was tested by 12 volunteers, and a total of 144 sets of 
test results were obtained for each device. The testing protocol allowed SWPFs up to 250,000 to be measured 
(limit of quantification). Median SWPFs for all respirators, except one SAR, were at or above this reporting limit. 
Lower fifth percentiles were above 100,000, except for one SAR previously noted. An assigned protection 
factor (APF) was estimated for each respirator by dividing the lower fifth percentile by a safety factor of 25. 
APFs ranged from 6000-10,000 for PAPRs (including one loose-fitting PAPR) and 3400-10,000 for SARs, with 
one exception. This SAR had a lower fifth percentile of less than 20 and an estimated APF of 1. Results indicated 
that most respirators tested could provide a high degree of protection for workers, although one National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved SAR provided minimal, if any, protection. Direct testing 
in a simulated workplace seems the only method that will assure employers of choosing an adequate SAR. This 
may be true for other classes of respirators. Furthermore, the historical approach of establishing APFs for 
classes of respirators, rather than individual models, may not provide adequate protection to the wearer. This is 
also a serious problem for regulatory agencies seeking to promulgate respirator standard provisions such as 
APFs for classes of respirators.

Abstract Several organizations list assigned protection factors. For supplied air hoods, the value of the assigned 

protection factors varies from <10 to 2,000 depending on the organization. Workplace protection factors 
(WPFs) of a supplied air hood were measured during aircraft sanding and painting operations on several types 
of aircraft to evaluate whether the American National Standard Z88.2 (1992) assigned protection factor of 
1,000 was realistic. The primary contaminant during these activities is strontium chromate. Samples collected 
inside the hood show that employees during sanding and painting operations were not exposed to strontium. 
The respirator performed adequately. This study is consistent with other simulated and WPF studies in that the 
ANSI Z88.2 WPF of 1,000 is supported.
