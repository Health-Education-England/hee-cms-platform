7. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

As we write this foreword, just at the close of the last financial year, more than 30 million people have received their 
first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Health Education England (HEE) has played a crucial role in making this possible, from 
our Chief Nurse leading the workforce preparations, communications supporting the cross-NHS campaign and our 
Technology Enhanced Learning team delivering e-learning.

Whilst responding to the pandemic, we worked closely with partners to continue education and training where 
possible. We deployed doctors in training flexibly, partnered with ambulance trusts to maintain student placements, 
ensured student nurses could continue to study, and provided training for the Vaccination Programme.

Our Annual Report & Accounts shows how we delivered during 2020-21, a year in which HEE responded to 
unprecedented challenges with compassion and agility. We supported patients, learners and the NHS with our 
unique expertise and system responsibilities.

Key pandemic responses

• supported around 40,000 learners to play key roles including nursing, midwifery, allied health profession (AHP) 
students and medical student volunteers

• created and implemented a foundation interim year so final year medical students could volunteer as foundation 
doctors ahead of the usual August start date. Around 3,800 doctors were deployed in England

• launched COVID-19 free global e-learning, used nearly 4.5 million times
• led workforce modelling, providing real time evidence and information about the skills and expertise of learners, 

enabling matching to NHS need
• supported thousands of colleagues to work remotely supporting the NHS, ensuring the education and training 

of learners, and protecting the pipeline of new professionals for the NHS. We thank all our colleagues for their 
extraordinary work in this extraordinary year

Our ability to invest in learners was hugely impacted by the pandemic, leading to a budget underspend at the end  
of the financial year. Catching up for learners who were disrupted is a significant issue and cost for 2021-22.

Supporting the future workforce

Whilst we played our part in dealing with the crisis, we remained focused on our key priority: ensuring future NHS 
workforce supply. Investment has been made to increase clinical placements and grow nursing, midwifery, and allied 
health professions, through our Clinical Placement Expansion Programme. During 2020-21 we also saw a record 
increase in applications to become nurse students with 32% growth in year. We recruited record numbers of GP 
trainees, with 3,793 posts, 500 more than our target. We also expanded training places for clinical psychologists  
and child and adolescent psychotherapists by 25%. 

Making HEE the Best Place to Work

Last year the Board identified HEE becoming the Best Place to Work as their key priority, recognising that supported, 
involved, and engaged colleagues deliver better results. We ensured the pandemic did not marginalise this goal. 
In many ways the pandemic forced us to move faster towards improving our ways of working and our culture. We 
continued to implement recommendations from our staff engagement programmes and co-created our values: 
responsible, fair, confident, and inclusive.

As we embed these values, we will also explore what the future of work should look like. We will gather information, 
evidence, and intelligence about the possibilities for delivering our priorities in more flexible, agile, sustainable and 
family friendly ways by harnessing technology and the lessons of the pandemic.

Foreword from our Chair and Chief Executive

Making HEE a Digital First organisation

The NHS further embracing digital technology is vital and preparing a digital ready workforce is key to its success 
therefore we are committed to building a Digital First HEE; walking our talk. Our Topol Fellows for Digital 
Healthcare continued with the second cohort, making over 50 fellows to date. We played a key role in creating and 
implementing the inaugural blended learning nursing degree using current and emerging digital and innovative 
technologies. Our Digital Boards programme, with NHS Providers, is helping Boards understand the potential and 
implications of the digital agenda and increasing their confidence and capability to harness it.

The future

We have continued to build on our commitment to cooperation and collaboration with partners such as NHS England 
and NHS Improvement (NHSE/I), the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), Royal Colleges, professional 
regulators, and providers of NHS services. We worked closely with DHSC to inform the contents of the recent white 
paper for the Health and Care Bill. We look forward to working with new Integrated Care Services (ICSs) as they 
develop. We will also work with  partners to refresh our strategic workforce planning framework.

Next year will have its own challenges, including recovering from the pandemic and embedding its lessons, but we 
remain focused on ensuring the NHS has the workforce it needs including key commitments around 6,000 extra 
doctors in primary care, 26,000 extra primary care professionals, and 50,000 additional nurses.

None of HEE’s achievements are possible without our people, our advisory committees, and our partners. We are 
grateful to them all. In particular we would like to offer our sincere thanks to Professor Wendy Reid for her excellent 
leadership of HEE as Interim Chief Executive, before Dr Navina Evans started in post.

About Health Education England

HEE is part of the NHS and works with partners to plan, recruit, educate and train the NHS workforce. HEE was 
established by Parliament in 2012 as a Special Health Authority, and in 2015 became a Non-Departmental Public 
Body through the Care Act 20141. The Care Act 2014 sets out HEE’s remit, roles and responsibilities, including its 
duty to ensure an effective system of education and training for the NHS and public health. The Care Act 2014 also 
places a duty on HEE to have regard to the NHS Constitution 2.

The NHS Constitution establishes the principles and values of the NHS in England and unites patients, the public and 
staff in a shared ambition for health and high-quality care for all, now and for future generations. We are committed 
to putting patients at the heart of everything we do, promoting transparency and equity and ensuring the efficient 
use of public money.

In 2020-21 Parliament and government entrusted HEE with £4.341bn, to plan, recruit, educate and train the health 
workforce. The government’s annual mandate to HEE is a requirement of the Care Act 2014 and it sets out the 
government’s strategic objectives for HEE in the following areas:

• workforce planning
• education
• training.

HEE provides national strategic leadership and policy development, national and international interventions, and 
tailored solutions regionally and locally. It is accountable, through its Board, to the Secretary of State for Health and 
Social Care for the delivery of the mandate.

To reflect that HEE cannot deliver its objectives alone, HEE worked with NHS Improvement (NHSI) to develop an 
interim mandate in October 2020, issued by the Secretary of State in December 2020. On behalf of both Boards, the 
Chairs signed off the draft, ensuring it met service requirements, before the Secretary of State gave final approval.
This year HEE has sought opportunities to align regional teams with NHSE/I to further develop collaborative working, 
including as part of the wider NHS response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The interim mandate3, was expected to be updated once the UK emerged from the COVID-19 crisis. It was 
developed collaboratively by HEE and NHSI - with People Plan workstream leads, Chief Professional Officers and NHS 
Long Term Plan service priority leads. Supporting the government to manage COVID-19 was the priority focus. HEE 
worked with arm’s length body (ALB) partners to ensure a robust response to the impact of COVID-19 on the NHS, 
its staff and patients. It was agreed that adjustments would be made to the expected amount of progress in other 
areas of the mandate to take account of this. To ensure effective overall alignment, all the deliverables partially or 
wholly owned by HEE in the NHS People Plan were transposed to both our 2020-21 mandate and Business Plan. 

Framework Agreement 

The Framework Agreement between the DHSC and HEE for 2018 to 20214 defines how we work together; and how 
both discharge their accountability responsibilities effectively. It also sets out that HEE will work collaboratively with 
NHSE/I and other partners, building effective relationships to achieve shared goals.

How we operate

We are led by our Chair and Chief Executive, who are part of our Board, alongside Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors. We also have Regional Directors who lead locally, making decisions on how best to assure and support 
performance in their region, as well as supporting local system transformation and working as part of integrated 
regional teams with colleagues from other ALBs.

About Health Education England

HEE’s Board provides strategic leadership and accountability to government, Parliament, and the public. The Board 
is supported by committees which undertake detailed scrutiny in their areas of responsibility, providing regular 
reporting, and formal assurance. Further details about our Board, its committees and membership are presented 
from page 48.

For further information https://www.hee.nhs.uk/about/how-we-work/our-leaders-structure

Over the past year, as HEE responded to and supported the NHS response to the COVID-19, the HEE Board and 
Executive Team have focused the organisation’s role around three strategic goals. These articulate outcomes that will 
make a difference to stakeholders, reflect our purpose and align with our statutory responsibilities. These goals are:

• Future Workforce: ensure the future supply of the healthcare workforce to meet NHS needs
• Current Workforce: transform the current healthcare workforce to use new science, technology and work 

differently 
• Quality and Patient Safety: improve the quality of the learning environments for trainees, prioritising patient 

safety

The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented disruption to the deployment, education, training and assessment 
of learners, who are the future NHS workforce. Throughout 2020-21 HEE engaged with other health and education 
bodies, regulators, placement providers, professional bodies and learners to develop contingency plans and issue 
guidance and clarity to learners and education providers. HEE responded to this challenge in four important ways:

• bolstering health services under pressure by maximising the contribution students in the final stages of training 
could make, and supporting those students as they stepped up; also enabling other students to contribute as 
assistants or volunteers

• enabling learners to progress with their training as far as possible, by seeking to recognise competences developed 
even where placement roles changed as a result of the pandemic

• developing new ways to recruit, train and assess students and trainees whose skills the NHS will rely upon in 
future, while fully complying with measures to combat COVID-19

• working with NHSE/I and others to support Regional Workforce Cells, ensuring cohesive oversight of education, 
training, and deployment whilst embedding workforce supply, education, and training principles into restoration 
and recovery

To achieve these goals HEE needs to deliver our core responsibilities which provide our business plan framework and 
align with team and individual objectives:

• workforce planning and analysis
• postgraduate medical and dental education
• clinical education and training
• quality of education and training
• workforce transformation

In addition to supporting 240,000 health learners in their education and development, many of the deliverables in 
the Business Plan were developed with partners as part of producing the NHS People Plan. These deliverables were 
assessed for affordability and delivery within HEE’s budget.

11. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

The Board and Executive Team have responsibility for HEE’s direction and performance. They set the vision,  
strategy, and goals through to the delivery of effective performance by teams and individuals. Therefore, Directors 
need to deliver focused strategic leadership and effective scrutiny of HEE’s operation in line with its mandate and 
Business Plan.

The Operating Model outlines how HEE works and adds value, where decisions are made and how it fits into the 
wider health and social care landscape. It aligns policy and strategy with the implementation and delivery of our 
priorities through support functions and governance. HEE’s Plan on a Page provided a framework to focus everyone 
on ‘the big picture’ and guide our work during 2020-21 and beyond. It set out a new purpose statement for  
2020-21, supported by three long term goals which effectively set out why HEE exists. Value for money for  
taxpayers runs through everything we do.

Critical interdependencies between HEE’s strategic direction and the wider system are considered when determining 
our priorities which assist the NHS achieve its service outcomes for patients and the population of England.

Our Strategic Direction

NHS Long Term Plan (LTP)

The NHS LTP was published on 7 January 2019 to make the NHS fit for the future, setting out key ambitions, whilst 
securing maximum value for patients out of every taxpayer pound.

The plan outlines clinical priorities, chosen for their impact on the nation’s health and where outcomes often do not match 
those of other advanced health systems. These priorities include cancer, cardiovascular disease, maternity and neo-natal 
health, mental health, stroke, diabetes, and respiratory care. It also includes system priorities such as giving people 
more control over their own health and care and encouraging more collaboration between general practitioner’s 
(GPs), their teams and community services (known as primary care networks), to improve services they provide jointly.

Finally, the plan continues the move towards the ‘triple integration’ of health and care systems, primary and 
secondary care and mental and physical health. Integrated Care Systems (ICS), which are a key tenet of the 
forthcoming Health and Care Bill. Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) are the preferred vehicle with an expectation 
that all Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) will evolve into ICSs. ICSs place a greater emphasis on 
place, population, and systems. When developed and mature they will be able to take more control of funding and 
performance with less involvement from national bodies and regulators.

NHS People Plan

The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care commissioned a People Plan to follow the publication of the LTP. 
This recognised the critical role of the workforce in delivering LTP service objectives, the need to tackle shortages in 
certain groups, and take forward workforce transformation, with new roles and new ways of working. HEE played a 
critical role in developing We are the NHS: People Plan 2020-21 - action for us all, published in July 2020.

DHSC mandate to HEE

The mandate for 2020-21 was developed in close collaboration with NHSI as well as with the Department of Health 
and Social Care (DHSC) and sets out the key HEE priorities for 2020-21. Details of the mandate are set out on page 10.

Health and Care Bill
 
Looking to the future, the Health and Care Bill, proposed in a white paper in February 2021 and addressed in the 
Queen's Speech proposes removal of the local education and training boards (LETBs) from statute. The proposal 
emphasises the importance of regional planning and supports HEE in being able to design its own operating model 
in order to work effectively and without duplication with the regional people and workforce boards, encouraging a 
holistic approach to workforce at regional levels. 

With regards to workforce accountability, the white paper contains proposals to create a duty for the Secretary 
of State for Health and Social Care to publish a document, once every five years, which sets out roles and 
responsibilities for workforce planning and supply in England.  
 
HEE’s role in relation to Workforce Planning is already set out in the Care Act 2014, and specifically includes 
responsibilities (delegated from the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care) around commissioning of education 
and training, ensuring sufficient numbers of health care workers are available to work in the NHS and the annual 
publication of a document setting out priorities and expected outcomes (a national workforce plan), it is our 
expectation that HEE will be an integral partner in the delivery of this duty.

Performance Report

Statement on performance from our Chief Executive

In a year of unprecedented challenges, I am extremely proud of my colleagues who responded to the pandemic 
fantastically. Our agility and relationships were key as we worked more closely than ever with system partners. We 
responded when the NHS needed us by leading workforce modelling, providing much-needed data and analysis to 
ensure our learner’s expertise and skills were matched to frontline NHS needs.

With partners, we helped around 40,000 students and trainees, including nurse, midwife, allied health profession 
(AHP) students and medical student volunteers to supplement the clinical workforce. We were proud to develop 
the Foundation Interim Year resulting in 3,800 final year medical students working as Foundation doctors ahead of 
the usual UK Foundation start date. We also launched a COVID-19 workforce e-learning programme, as well as vital 
training resources for a huge number of people delivering the vaccination programme.

We worked tirelessly to protect the future NHS workforce, including increasing clinical placements and supporting 
growth in nursing, midwifery and AHPs through our Clinical Placement Expansion Programme. We helped deliver 
record rises in nurse student university applications (up 32%) and the record numbers of GP trainees with 3,793 
posts, 500 more than our target. We also expanded training places for Clinical Psychologists and Child and 
Adolescent Psychotherapists by 25%.

During this difficult period for the whole health system, we also turned our gaze inwards, proving we can work 
differently, and that challenging times can lead to improvement by working with greater flexibility and collaboration. 
We continue our ambition to make HEE the Best Place to Work through three ‘We Are HEE’ online crowd sourcing 
workshops to hear colleagues’ aspirations, frustrations and suggestions. Our staff networks continue to grow in 
influence, scope and size, playing vital roles in making HEE a space for everyone to thrive. We also continue to have 
excellent partnership relations with trades unions.

The pandemic proved the need for a digital ready workforce. The NHS is more dependent on digital technology 
than ever so we must prepare people to embrace technology and apply it more readily. Using current and emerging 
technology we developed a blended learning nursing degree to widen access to nursing careers. Our second cohort 
of Topol Digital Fellows brings us to over 50 fellows to date.

We are optimistic and ready for the future. We will support NHS recovery and work with partners to grow the 
workforce and capture the innovations this unique environment made us deliver.

This report reflects our achievements to March 2021. For details of next year’s plans please see Recovery and 
Delivery, HEE’s 2021-22 Business Plan.

Performance Report

Overview

This section outlines progress on HEE’s 2020-21 Business Plan and mandate commitments. 

The pandemic resulted in HEE adapting and reprioritising where it could add most value. HEE worked with partners 
to support over 40,000 learners into front line and volunteer roles. HEE led workforce modelling to inform national 
decisions, support local providers and provided online training for frontline workers. The impact of this work means 
whilst our long-term priorities remain the same, the phasing of them has and will change.

HEE also maintained, as far as possible, its business-as-usual activities across:

• workforce planning and analysis
• medical and dental education
• clinical education and training
• quality of education and training
• workforce transformation

We continue to work with partners to ensure that opportunities arising from the Britain’s exit from the EU particularly 
in relation to reform or improvement to our clinical education and training systems are realised. This includes, 
continued monitoring of the clinical workforce from the European Economic Area and working to ensure the 
continued flow of trained health and care professionals into the UK, and capitalising on opportunities to increase the 
number of health and care staff, in the context of the response to COVID-19. 

We have reported against 63 key Business Plan and People Plan commitments. The tables within Annex 1 provide 
a comprehensive summary of HEE’s delivery against these commitments: 46 are complete, 8 are on track, 7 are 
slightly off track and 2, (number of Nursing Associates trained by December 2020; working with local health systems 
to support a cohort of 400 Advance Care Practitioners by March 2021), were significantly off track because of the 
pandemic. HEE and DHSC have been reviewing the impact of COVID-19 and 2021 trajectories are currently being 
agreed. The HEE Board and Performance Assurance Committee have been appraised of progress towards delivery of 
the key Business Plan and People Plan commitments throughout the year. 

A more detailed analysis of HEE’s performance, including key achievements and challenging areas of delivery, is 
reflected in the next section of the report.



17. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

This performance analysis includes an assessment of HEE’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and progress towards 
the government’s manifesto commitments to:

• expand the nursing workforce by an additional 50,000 
• expand the primary care workforce by 6,000 extra doctors in primary care and 26,000 extra primary care 

professionals 
• develop primary care training hubs

HEE mapped its 2020-21 deliverables to the core business areas identified in HEE’s 2019-20 strategic review. This 
performance analysis mirrors these areas to provide the golden thread between strategy and delivery. By keeping 
a clear focus on delivery, HEE expects to be able to support a more sustainable workforce in the future that works 
differently to provide safe and compassionate healthcare. 



18. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

Workforce Planning and Analysis 

Workforce planning is complex and difficult. It requires long term forecasts, considering assumptions such as 
new models of care, the impact of new technology and new ways of working. In the 2020-21 business plan, HEE 
committed to supporting a system-wide model of workforce planning for regional, ICS and place-based delivery. 
There were three deliverables: 

• develop sources to inform planning and decision making by increasing data access
• produce regular updates comparing supply and demand, setting out key risks and intervention opportunities
• implement a HEE strategy for data collection

Progress has been made in all areas with more work planned on the impact of the COVID-19 wave. Our Workforce 
Planning and Intelligence vision is to ‘exploit data, information, knowledge and technology to enable health and care 
partners to take real actions that shape the workforce’.

The events of 2020-21 sharply focused the need to apply data and analytics in ‘real-time’. HEE colleagues were 
seconded directly into COVID-19 workforce cells to deploy their expertise: supporting the early response through 
to overseeing the establishment of vaccination centres. Other resources, projects and products were redirected and 
reshaped to support the NHS.

We developed tools to support frontline services during the pandemic. As the virus spread, these tools were 
adopted and adapted. Critical care staffing models, combining clinical expertise with analytical know-how enabled 
assessment of bed and staff requirements, considering working patterns and skill mix. These tools - constructed 
extremely rapidly - informed strategy and delivery plans. Analysis of data from HEE’s Trainee Information System (TIS) 
and the NHS Electronic Staff Record (ESR) identified staff with airways ‘management competences to support the 
COVID-19 response. Other tools drew on ESR to identify latent surge capacity.

We worked with education providers and NHS trusts to support the design and rapid delivery of a bespoke system to 
enable student deployment into the workforce and extend placements at the height of the first wave. The tools have 
been repurposed to track disruption to training pathways, support remediation, and enable assessment of the impact 
of remediation on future supply. 

We also continued to support wider work: including translating the 50,000 full time equivalent (FTE) government 
target for nurse expansion into a programme of interventions with agreed national trajectories and translated into 
regional plans. Analytical techniques developed by HEE are now used across DHSC, NHSE/I and HEE to commonly 
monitor progress. These same techniques, combined with the analysis and visualisation of long-term demographic 
trends are directly informing the distribution of postgraduate medical and dental training posts, and supporting the 
Multi-professional Education and Training Investment Planning (METIP) process.

Our new national student data collection has provided consistent robust data on student starters, active students, and 
placement activity. HEE is deploying this data and tools alongside locally nuanced intelligence and interpretation to 
support ICSs assessing current and future workforce supply and demand to support their place-based workforce plans 
and strategy. Such intelligence is shared as on-line resources in the newly developed virtual Workforce Observatory 5.



19. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

Medical and Dental Education 

The demand for high quality care is increasing in volume and complexity, with shortages of staff in some parts of 
England and the health and care system. The 2020-21 Business Plan identified the need to shift from the dominance 
of highly specialised medicine to more generalist skills which can be transferred and extended over a career and 
improve retention by improving the working lives of doctors in training, through more flexible and relevant training 
programmes.

Response to COVID-19 

HEE’s Foundation Interim Year doctor initiative allowed final year medical students to volunteer to work as 
Foundation doctors ahead of the usual UK Foundation Programme start date in August to support the pandemic 
response. 3,800 doctors were deployed.

This and other initiatives were clearly going to impact education and training, including financially. To manage 
this, we took a series of measures in concert with partners like NHSE/I and DHSC. These included paying clinical 
placement providers 25% of annual cost in Q1 to maintain stability, constant monitoring of data to identify where 
more support may be needed, and a phased return to the usual practice of paying by activity as the year progressed 
and it became apparent some trusts were being disadvantaged with the block payment system. We continue to 
work with DHSC and Her Majesty’s Treasury (HMT) on the need for recovery costs to get training back on track for 
many doctors, recognising that the impact on training pushed our spending need from 2020-21 to 2021-22 which is 
why we are reporting an underspend this year. More details on this are included in the Financial Review at page 43.

Dental trainees and HEE staff were redeployed into other areas of the NHS to support the pandemic response. 
Foundation dentists worked in intensive care, haematology, swab testing, occupational health, antibody testing, 
mortuary, local NHS 111 Dental Clinical Assessment Service, care homes, Pharmacy Prescription Medication Analysis 
Tool, track and trace and PPE supply chain. In some regions trainees were redeployed to acute settings within their 
Trusts such as ICU and maternity services whilst others provided an urgent dental care service or worked in the

Delivering Medical and Dental Education commitments

There were 11 deliverables mapped to this area: 

 
Work with GMC, Medical Schools and Medical Royal Colleges to transform education/training of future doctors: 
• Following a Call for Evidence and stakeholder events, HEE published the findings which included lessons learned 

from COVID-19 in July 2020.  

Offer mechanical thrombectomy credentialing (30 doctors by 2023/24), and other credentials:  
• mechanical thrombectomy - The Royal College of Radiologists and HEE developed a credential for a national 

workforce able to provide a 24/7 service to treat thrombotic stroke. The credential builds on interventional 
radiology training. Specialty representatives have been fully engaged in the work. This deliverable was rated amber 
at the year end due to a delay in discussions with partner organisations including the Royal College of Radiologists 
(RCR), GMC and UK Medical Education Reference Group (UKMERG) regarding systematisation. The delivery date 
remains as March 2024 for the target of 30 doctors to have completed the credential. There is also an aspiration 
to open the credential up to doctors from cardiology and stroke medicine in the future

• obstetric physician - HEE and the Royal College of Physicians designed and implemented a pre-CCT pilot for a 
higher specialty trainee in obstetric medicine. This is designed to develop a route for trainee physicians from 
any specialty to develop expertise in obstetric medicine, in most cases through an out of programme period of 
experience (OOPE).

• breast disease - working with the Royal College of Radiologists, HEE developed and implemented a pilot 
programme for 10 trainees across 5 training sites to test a credentialed training pathway, delivering independent 
practitioners in breast disease management  

Support more flexible medical training to improve trainee experience and diversity and increase trainee numbers: 
• phase 3 of the Out of Programme-Pause (OOPP) started in August 2020, with trainees from all specialties and 

regions now able to apply to go on "OOPP" for 12 months
• more flexible less than full time training is available for Emergency Medicine, Obstetrics, and Gynaecology and 

Paediatrics with proposals to expand into other specialisms, such as physician only specialties, anaesthetics, 
radiology, and Intensive Care Medicine

• the Flexible Portfolio Training pilot with the Royal College of Physicians is continuing with two cohorts currently  
in training and plans for a third cohort underway

• the evaluation of pilot education/training models for dental professionals to improve content/flexibility and 
develop careers is scheduled to complete in September 2021. Findings since evaluation began have fed into 
education and training development 

Psychiatry: Increase training posts/support/education, run campaigns, increase recruitment: 
• HEE funded the Royal College of Psychiatrists #choosepsychiatry campaign and master classes to support trainees 

who failed the CASC exam. The fill rate for Core Psychiatry is now at 100%, and 2020-21 applications are up 
84% from last year

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

 
Introduce initiatives to improve experience of Specialty and Associate Specialist (SAS) grade doctors/dentists and 
improve formal training and reforming training: 
• after publishing ‘Maximising the Potential’ in 2019, HEE supported the development of SAS doctors and dentists by 

managing a development fund aligned to local workforce priorities and working with the Academy of Medical Royal 
Colleges to improve flexibility in training, including supporting SAS doctors to step into formal training programmes  

 
Develop the educational offer for generalist training and work with local systems to develop leadership and 
infrastructure: 
• seven regional trailblazers were identified. The first Trailblazer Development Group took place in April 2021. This 

deliverable was reported as off-track at the year end due to a change in the funding schedule leading to changed 
priorities. The focus is to continue to develop the core educational offer ready for a ‘soft launch’ in August and 
piloting it after this point  

 
Increase training/recruitment opportunities to support 6,000 more doctors working in primary care by 2024: 
• HEE is working with NHSE/I to support retention and return GPs to practice as well as multiple integrated 

workstreams, across all regions, to support the education and training needs of trainees by developing existing 
and alternative programmes

• HEE is also collating and spreading best practice in reducing differential attainment which negatively impacts both 
the number and attainment level of primary care professionals

• against an increased target of 4,000 GP trainees, round 1 of 2021 recruitment ended with 7,639 applications - 
1866 up on the same time last year

• HEE also finalised allocations for Targeted Enhanced Recruitment Scheme (TERS). The TERS scheme has grown 
from 105 places in its first year to 285 places in 2020-21 and 500 places have been advertised to deliver the next 
recruitment round in 2021-22

 
Support 1,000 Physician Associate (PA) trainees: 
• HEE has surpassed its mandate target with 1459 PAs completing training by the end of January 2021, and PAs 

working in primary care has grown from 17 to 457 

 
Ensure that skills gained by medical trainees while working in other roles during COVID-19 count towards training: 
• HEE worked with the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine to develop self-certified recording of capability gained 

working in other areas during COVID-19 with the facility for them to be signed off and recognised through Annual 
Review of Competency Progression (ARCP) 

 
Explore development of Return to Practice (RtP) for doctors, creating a route from temporary professional registration 
to full registration: 
• phase 1 of a programme model for RtP (now called Career refresh for Medicine) went live in November 2020. 

Extensive communication and engagement took place to introduce the programme to the system with the aim to 
open access for 100 doctors in 2020-21. Over 130 applications were received from applicants across England, with 
over 100 eligible applicants now being supported to return to practice

Clinical Education and Training
 
HEE highlighted the importance of clinical education and training by making 33 commitments for 2020-21, the  
most high-profile being delivery of the government’s manifesto commitment to expand the nursing workforce by  
an additional 50,000 nurses, which HEE is taking an “all levers at all levels” approach to meeting as detailed below.

COVID-19 response

In response to the pandemic, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), introduced emergency education standards 
in March 2020 which enabled second and third year students to opt into paid placements. HEE worked with 
universities and placement providers to place 23,000 students in clinical services. As the service need changed the 
emergency standards were stood down in September 2020. Our focus was then on supporting students back onto 
their learning programme.

In February 2021 as the number of cases increased the NMC reintroduced emergency standards to enable final 
year nursing students to opt-in via extended clinical placement. HEE conducted an impact assessment of education 
programmes to inform and oversee the development of restart and recovery plans and has worked with partners
to support students and provide them with the education and training resources wherever they worked or were on 
placement.

The NMC Recovery Emergency Standards also enabled 300 hours of simulated practice to count towards practice 
hours which will reduce pressure on placement providers. In response, HEE has invested in universities for new 
simulated training facilities and technology.

Performance Analysis

50,000 Nursing Growth

HEE is working collaboratively with NHSE/I towards our shared commitment to delivering the government’s ambition 
to employ 50,000 additional nurses. Our role is to ensure sustained applicant growth for, and reduce attrition from, 
nursing degrees. UCAS reported 35% growth in domestic applicants for courses starting in 2021-22.

HEE’s efforts to grow undergraduate nurse training were strengthened by the government’s additional financial 
support through a non-repayable grant for nursing, midwifery and most AHP students. HEE also worked with higher 
education partners, Directors of Nursing and their teams to increase clinical placements including new technology- 
enhanced placements and more primary care placements.

We are also seeking to encourage graduates into postgraduate study for a Registered Nursing (RN) degree as this 
enables NMC registration within two years. HEE is qualitatively researching potential motivations and barriers to 
applying for future marketing and engagement campaigns. HEE has also developed an online blended nursing 
degree and awarded seven providers a share of £5.6m to develop new access routes for adult nursing.

HEE has developed an education capacity tool to forecast education capacity which assists in understanding 
possibility for growth. The first collection was launched in May. The Nursing Associate workforce will also support 
this programme as there is an expectation some NAs will undertake further training to become fully qualified 
registered nurses.

HEE has made a commitment to deliver 1,400 FTE registered nurses via the registered nurse degree apprenticeship 
to support the ambition of 50,000. These apprentices will count towards the spring 2024 end date for the 50,000 
target if they meet timely start dates in 2020-21 and 2021-22.

HEE is also leading work to reduce attrition from nurse degree course from 11% to 7.7% by 2024. Interdependencies 
between attrition and all other domestic supply programmes make this integral to achieving the overall 50,000 
target. HEE, NHSE/I, DHSC and Department for Education (DfE) are ensuring timely collection of data for forecasting 
and planning. HEE has also increased emphasis on student wellbeing and pastoral support during placements to 
address any underlying issues that lead to attrition by developing a supervisor toolkit to improve student experience 
and support diversity.

Increasing Nursing Associates 

HEE supported the recruitment of 2,641 trainee Nursing Associates, which due to the pandemics impact on 
resources and training opportunities was below the original 5,000 target due to be delivered by December 2020.  
In the first quarter of 2021 (Jan-Mar), regional intelligence shows delivery of 2,937 against the programme forecast, 
and target, of 5,000. Full year trajectories and plans across all regions are being worked on alongside close 
monitoring of whether numbers are recovering. To support the regions to achieve the TNA 5,000 target, a national 
delivery plan has been produced and agreed with regional TNA leads which includes: 

• working in collaboration with ‘NHS Employers’ to promote the NA role, including a series of webinars for 
employers 

• production of an animated film, showcasing practical examples of deployment of NAs across different settings 
and specialisms - featuring stories from our TNA/NA national ambassadors 

• working with the HEE Primary Care team (PC), PC training hubs and NHSE/I contacts to educate Primary 
Care Networks on the NA role, encouraging recruitment of TNAs given their inclusion in the Additional Roles 
Reimbursement Scheme (ARRS)

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

HEE has worked with Kings College to survey employers about the Nursing Associate role. The results will inform 
required training numbers for future years. We are also working with NHS Employers to better understand 
employers’ views of the NA role. A 2021 delivery plan is being formulated which will showcase the National Nursing 
Associate and Training Nursing Associate ambassadors, and encompass joint working with NHS Employers and NHSE/I. 

Midwifery
 
To help achieve the target to grow midwifery training places by 3,650 by 2022-23; HEE has supported a growth in 
midwifery training places by 626 in 2019-20 in comparison to the baseline year of 2018-19. The data for 2020-21  
will become available in late summer as this is captured through a student data collection which commences in  
June and allows for the student intake in February/March 2021 to be counted and verified.

HEE implemented the maternity support worker (MSW) Competency, Education and Career Development 
Framework. Working with the University of West England (UWE) we have developed the MSW Voluntary Curriculum 
(ready for publication post-COVID-19 restrictions).

HEE has invested £1 million to support local maternity systems (LMS) to map their existing maternity support 
workforce to the Framework. We have developed an e-Learning bridging programme for existing maternity support 
workers to support alignment to the Framework.

Allied Health Professionals 

HEE planned a phased increase in clinical placement capacity starting with a minimum of 1,500 in 2020-21.  
A national AHP student practice learning programme was created in November 2020 to increase practice learning 
capacity and quality. The pandemic affected this expansion but in many cases HEE AHP regional leads have been 
able to support organisations to stay on track, delivering supported growth, continued investment in continuing 
professional development (CPD) and the development of a number of apprenticeship programmes across AHP 
professions.

Delivering 26,000 more primary care professionals 

Along with 50,000 nursing growth and increasing GPs, the further investment in new primary care professionals, 
and the Primary Care Training Hubs to support them, were at the core of HEE’s mandate deliverables for 2020-21. 
Our Workforce Expansion Delivery Group is leading work to meet the educational and training needs of the wider 
workforce in primary care to deliver this commitment. All aspects of face to face learning and assessments were 
repurposed for online delivery, securing trainees for all cohorts during the pandemic.

Pharmacy 

HEE committed to developing new roles and expanding training for clinical pharmacists in GP settings. In 2020-21, 
1,094 clinical pharmacists commenced primary care training, an increase of 477 (43%) on 2019-20, which had
already exceeded the deliverable to enrol 500 clinical pharmacists to training. As well as this, primary care training  
for pharmacy technicians has commenced, with approximately 330 commencing training in 2020-21.

Primary Care Training Hubs (PCTH)

HEE developed delivery plans for PCTHs during 2020-21 as we engaged partners to agree funding for 
implementation over the next year. Sustainable funding is required to support the expansion of GP and wider 
workforce undergraduate and postgraduate training capacity.

Mental Health 

Since March 2016 the Mental Health workforce has grown by 14,480 requiring a further 5,910 to meet the growth 
identified in Stepping Forward to 2020-21: The Mental Health Workforce Plan for England. In 2020-21 Stepping 
Forward and the LTP overlapped, giving a new combined growth ambition of 9,500. To help meet this need, increase 
capacity and deliver service transformation, targeted action has included HEE commissioning a further c6,000 
training places across the range of the programme. Targeted action has included:

• an extra 650 training places for Children’s Wellbeing Practitioner and Improving Access to Psychological Therapies, 
465 Education Mental Health Practitioners and supervisors

• upskilling and learning opportunities around caring for people with serious mental health problems, people in 
crisis, those suffering from eating disorders, and women, babies, and their families during the perinatal period

• an extra 120 core psychiatry training places in key geographical areas, 25% more clinical psychologist and child 
and adolescent psychotherapist places and over 100 one-year postgraduate courses for clinically experienced 
psychology graduates considering a mental health career

• Training Associate Psychological Practitioners to manage psychological distress in those with Long Term Conditions 
(LTC), providing more routes into psychological careers and commissioning adult IAPT LTC top-up training

• the first national Competence Framework and curriculum for Mental Health Peer Support Workers (PSW), the 
inaugural PSW Benchmarking Report and 15 Trailblazers to train 230 PSWs and 100 supervisors

• funding Responsible Clinician training for 74 senior clinicians and enabling Advanced Practice training for 48 more 
as part of a new Advanced Practice Mental Health Curriculum and Capabilities Framework

• new eating disorder learning resources for medical students and F1/F2 doctors.
• bursaries for normally self-funded aspiring child and adolescent psychotherapists to undertake mandatory pre- 

clinical training experience
• a benchmarking exercise and 2,926 adult IAPT training opportunities
• commissioning the Personality Disorder Knowledge and Understanding Framework Hub to enable a nationally 

coordinated approach to training
• Florence Nightingale Foundation for 3 nurse and nursing associates leadership cohorts
• an interim listening skills and emotional health digital training solution for crisis telephone staff with the 

Samaritans

The Care Certificate
 
Talent for Care was commissioned by NHSE/I to review the Care Certificate (CC). Phase one focused on an ‘accelerated’ 
version of the CCs content to link with NHSE/I’s Health Care Support Worker (HCSW) 2020 recruitment drive.

Phase two includes reviewing content to ensure its relevance, adding new content if needed, such as mental health 
and learning difficulties, and ensuring a relevant CPD offer to HCSWs to follow on from the CC itself. This CPD will, 
ideally, be recognised at level 3 to enable progression and include functional skills development as this has been 
identified as a key constraint on career and personal progression for many. 

Quality of Education and Training

Through our Quality Framework, HEE supports providers to plan placement shape and capacity in response to 
demand, changing patient need and new service models whilst maintaining high quality training. HEE’s quarterly 
updates highlight supply and demand comparisons and key intervention opportunities.

Postgraduate deans and their teams use insights from our multi-professional National Education and Training 
Survey (NETS), which covers all healthcare learners in NHS-funded placements or training, to improve the learning 
environment. The 2020-21 survey received 36,686 student and trainee responses, up 20% from 2019, despite the 
challenges posed by the pandemic. Over 90% of respondents who took part in the survey said that their overall clinical 
supervision was positive. Other key survey findings included 89% of students and trainees positively rating the overall 
educational experience gained in placement, 80% of learners stating they would recommend the placement location 
to friends and family requiring treatment and that a high proportion (86 per cent) of learners had not experienced 
instances of bullying and harassment and a similar proportion (85 per cent) had not witnessed any. However, while this 
is welcome news, we need to do better and it is one of the areas that we will be looking to improve on.

To enhance our role as system leaders for education and training we started a review and refresh of our Quality 
Strategy and Framework, through engagement with regulators, providers, universities, patients, learners and other 
partners, and, as part of the NHS Patient Safety Strategy, led the development of the first ever consistent multi-
professional NHS Patient Safety Syllabus.

Workforce Transformation 

Workforce Transformation is an essential part of HEE’s activities, promoting innovation and support for the NHS 
workforce to think, work and collaborate differently and funding a range of specialisms to improve skill levels 
including 400 Clinical Endoscopists, 300 digital change leaders and the continuing professional development of 
nurses, midwives and AHPs.

As part of the Cancer Workforce Plan, 315 trainees have completed or are in training to increase workforce capacity 
in earlier diagnosis of cancer. We progressed further training of clinical endoscopists across a range of modalities and 
developments to HEE’s training programme should help to attract new recruits and improve services for patients.

HEE worked with providers to allow doctors, nurses and AHPs to practice at the limits of their licence and promote 
new roles as technology advances. Our Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) programme supported the pandemic 
response by launching the e-Learning for Healthcare (e-LfH) COVID-19 programme, collating a directory of resources 
from organisations and commercial suppliers, producing and hosting the self-swab lateral flow device instructional 
film and making e-Learning resources globally available.

HEE also launched the first phase of the new Learning Hub in May 2020, whilst e-LfH saw its biggest year ever, with 
more than 22 million session launches and the Strategic Vision for Simulation and Immersive Technologies was
published, exploring how simulation-based programmes can enhance education, clinical practice and staff wellbeing.
Due to the pandemic HEE’s support for a cohort of 400 advanced clinical practitioners (ACPs) was not met and rated 
red at the year end. Although 332 ACPs were recruited through an additional cohort, this was set against the 2019-
20 baseline of 2,105. Delivery against the baseline during 2020-21 dropped to 1,700 so the additional cohort helped 
to make up the shortfall rather than increase overall numbers. The ACP role is intended to provide more efficient and 
effective use of existing staff with an immediate focus on primary care, older people’s services, cancer, mental health 
and learning disability. The new Learning Disability and Autism pathway was successfully developed during 2020-
21. Although the new ACP learners have been inducted onto the programme during the 2020-21 financial year, the 
formal programme does not commence until September 2021-22. 

During 2020-21 HEE strengthened its support to the ‘hidden army’ of volunteers and carers who make a vital 
contribution to the health service. We worked with Carers UK to develop an online training and support package 
which will enhance the development, resilience, and skills of unpaid carers. We also commissioned several practical 
guides to support multidisciplinary teams. 

HEE has supported local systems to make the best use of apprenticeships and the apprenticeship levy, creating new 
apprenticeships in mammography, diagnostic radiography & therapeutic radiography, sonography, and ACP for nurses. 

HEE STAR Tool 

The tool is proven to be up to four times more efficient and effective than other approaches to plan workforce 
change and is built around the five drivers of workforce transformation: supply, new ways of working, up-skilling, 
new roles and leadership. During 2020-21 it has been updated with new material to support the pandemic response 
and training has been delivered to over 200 colleagues across 80% of ICSs.

Performance Analysis

Innovative Programmes 

As well as the STAR tool HEE also promotes and encourages innovation in a strategic relationship with the Academic 
Health Science Network (AHSN). We have extended that relationship to cover workforce transformation, digital 
literacy, patient safety and immersive learning. We have also connected our Topol report Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) recommendation with the government’s AI Lab programme and established HEE’s role as the lead partner on 
workforce.

We have identified, trained, and engaged 27 AHSN workforce transformation trainers and facilitators, transplanted 
the Informatics Skills Development Network to five regions, worked with 10 AHSN facilitators to support Digital 
Literacy DLS centres and put in place collaborative arrangements with NHSX, the Accelerated Access Collaborative 
and the AHSN Network. Joint meetings and teams are leading us towards a common aim of joint workforce 
education, with HEE as the recognised lead partner.

Knowledge for Healthcare
 
Our key support for libraries has seen NHS staff and learners complete over a million searches on British Medical Journal 
(BMJ) Best Practice, the HEE funded national clinical decision support for the workforce This is key to our Knowledge 
for Healthcare strategy, 2021-26 which prioritises enabling staff, learners, and NHS organisations to use the right 
knowledge and evidence, at the right time. We also had a Parliamentary launch of the Gift of Time showing that 
NHS knowledge and library services are delivering a net economic annual value of £77m by saving clinician’s time.

Additional Organisational Drivers of Success 

The HEE Board’s ambition to make HEE the Best Place to Work is supported by our internal drivers of success.  
These drivers are interdependent and will improve how we operate and assist delivery of our core responsibilities  
and objectives.

Performance Improvement Culture 

HEE continued to strengthen and implement the Performance Maturity Action Plan, designed to develop an enhanced 
performance culture so we have clarity about whether we are delivering what we said we would. We aligned the 
performance framework to the Business Plan to ensure a golden thread from strategy to delivery. We reviewed and 
refined HEE’s performance metrics and are planning organisational development activities to support our ongoing 
improvement journey.

In February, HEE’s Portfolio Office held the NHS Project Futures FESTIVAL '21 Programme, bringing together over 650 
NHS staff with innovators and experts to promote key skills and the future of the NHS project profession. We launched 
the NHS Project and Change Capability Framework and four project and programme management apprenticeships for 
all levels of skill development.

A Benefits Management Framework has also been developed with training to support programme leads define, refine, 
map and report benefits. This supports our goal to focus more on outcomes by understanding and measuring the 
benefits of HEE’s work.

Governance and Decision Making 

Good governance ensures resources are directed in accordance with policy and priorities, that there is sound inclusive 
decision making and clear accountability for the use of resources to achieve desired outcomes for the NHS.

This year the Board has started to define its Board Assurance Framework, to be introduced in 2021-22 and refined  
its committee structure, introducing a new People Committee to ensure appropriate focus on HEE’s biggest resource, 
its own people.

HEE supports Regional People Boards with NHSE/I. These boards bring together regional health and care 
organisations and stakeholders to provide strategic leadership for the implementation of the People Plan and ICS/STP 
workforce plans. They also deliver the statutory responsibilities of the Local Education Training Boards (LETBs).

Science and Digital Technology 

Science and digital technology help us deliver our priorities more productively and quickly with higher quality whilst improving 
staff and stakeholder satisfaction. Our Information Strategy advances and progresses digital services, coordinates 
activity across six work programmes and takes advantage of disruptive technologies to potentially rethink delivery.

HEE’s Digital Readiness programme works through the NHS Digital Academy to deliver the Topol Review, which 
explored how education and training can prepare the workforce for the digital future. The aim is to uplift digital 
knowledge, understanding, skills and awareness for leaders, digital experts and the wider workforce to improve 
services. It is delivered with NHSX in four broad areas around the right culture, environment, and development for 
senior leaders; professionalising the digital workforce; improving workforce digital literacy; and building the future 
digital workforce.

This year’s highlights include very positive responses from the 24 Boards who have completed the Digital Boards’ 
programme we deliver with NHS Providers; establishing the Faculty of Clinical Informatics and the Federation of 
Informatics Professionals; starting to bring consistency to digital roles and the learning and development to support 
them; the growth of new collaborative networks, and spreading the Informatics Skills Development Network; 
benchmarking our workforce against industry standards; improved access via new graduate and apprenticeship 
programmes; and created development programmes for digital change leaders, ICS teams and aspirant digital 
change leaders.

Key Issues and risks to delivery

In 2020-21 the Board reviewed HEE’s existing risk exposure, potential future risks and developed a COVID-19 Risk 
Register alongside the Corporate Risk Register. The register included strategic, reputational, financial, operational and 
delivery risks, as well as external threats. HEE’s principal risks and identification of risks now closed is set out below:

Risk description

Supply of Learning Disability Nurses: 
Risk now closed 
There is a risk that without sustained growth in 
Learning Disability Nurse training numbers, who then 
take nursing posts, we will be unable to meet demand 
because of multiple years of insufficient recruitment 
to programmes.

Implementation of the Mental Health Workforce 
Plan: 
Risk now closed  
There is a risk that HEE may not be able to successfully 
deliver the Mental Health Implementation Plan 
to 2024. This is because no single body holds 
all the levers necessary to produce the required 
workforce and delays to increasing student numbers 
or introducing new training pathways or courses 
(because HEIs aren’t operating normally due to 
COVID-19) will also impact timescale of delivery.

Primary Care Workforce: 
Risk now closed 
There is a risk to the delivery of the additional 26,000 
primary care staff in and the implementation of 
the Primary Care workforce plan due to ongoing 
uncertainty about funding for Primary Care Training 
Hubs development.

Spending Review: 
Risk now closed 
The resources provisionally allocated to HEE for 
2021-22 may be insufficient to meet DHSC and NHS 
priorities.

Key mitigation(s) in place

• The residual risk has been significantly reduced due 
to a second increase of preregistration Learning 
Disability Nurses entering training and an increase 
starting on a Trainee Nurse Associate pathway into 
Learning Disability Nurse training.

• Providers, commissioners, ALBs (e.g. HEE, NHSE/I), 
local authorities and the third sector are working 
together to ensure we recruit, retrain, and retain 
the staff we need.

• Development of a new cross-system performance 
and assurance process in line with LTP ambitions 
to monitor and manage MH workforce growth 
internally and across the wider system.

• Funding for Primary Care Training Hubs in 2021-
22 was confirmed as part of our Spending Review 
discussions with the DHSC.

• The 2021-22 budget, agreed in a tripartite manner 
with DHSC and NHSE/I gives confidence HEE can 
deliver its Business Plan which includes DHSC and 
NHS priorities.

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

Risk description

HEE Staff Wellbeing and Longevity and 
Sustainability of Remote Working: 
Risk now closed 
There is a risk HEE may be unable to maintain 
momentum, stability, and sustainability for staff 
through a prolonged period of remote working 
resulting in dysfunction, fatigue, stress and illness. 
There is also a risk that staff may find they don’t 
have the skills to be successful in an extended remote 
environment.

Fraudulent Activity: 
There is a risk of increased fraudulent activity relating 
to cyber security and data risks that can increase, 

Postgraduate Medical Supply:
Risk now closed 
There is a risk to postgraduate trainee progression 
through the education and training pipeline due to 
the disruption to college assessments and exams 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes to the 
clinical environment to manage the pandemic pose a 
risk to experiential learning opportunities for trainees 
to meet the requirements of their specialty curricula. 
Also, some Medical Royal Colleges have cancelled or 
rescheduled specialty examinations.

Key mitigation(s) in place

• A number of actions including: the Health & 
Wellbeing Hub, the Learning & Development hub, 
Rapid OH response; regular staff communication 
focusing on connectivity and wellbeing; online 
workshops to listen to staff and their ideas; 
particular focus on key groups likely to feel greater 
impact e.g. parents and carers, those living alone 
and BAME staff.

• Access to some offices for those that need it through 
the COVID-19 secure workplace programme.

• We have not seen an increase in sickness absence 
nor indicators to suggest dysfunction.

• We are exploring longer term ways of working 
through the Future of Work.

• HEE has invested successfully in anti-cybercrime 
protection software and our approach has been 
subject to review through the Internal Audit Plan 
for 2020-21.

• We need to remain vigilant and alert to 
opportunistic fraud by cyber-criminals, but a recent 
data exercise showed IT recovery plans are robust.

• Finance staff remain vigilant with updates 
circulated to HEE colleagues on key awareness 
levels. The Counter Fraud Panel continually review.

• HEE has worked with the medical  royal colleges, 
the medical regulator, and statutory education 
bodies to agree derogations to decisions and 
curricula requirements, accepting alternative 
evidence and enabling trainees to progress to the 
next stage of training, where it is safe for them to 
do so.

• HEE is monitoring changes to trainees' planned 
placements, capturing trainee and educators' 
perceived risks; and actual impacts on progression, 
including outcomes and extensions, to identify and 
mitigate as needed.

For more about how we manage risks see pages 66 to 67.

Operational risks are managed within programmes, directorates and regions in line with HEE’s approach to risk 
management and the Board’s risk appetite for 2020-21, agreed March 2020.

Addressing local workforce challenges

None of the work in this report is possible without colleagues working together across HEE, with each other and 
with partners. However, our regions also work closely with local stakeholders to deliver local priorities, recognising 
the unique characteristics of each. Some highlights are captured in this section.

North East & Yorkshire

In 2020-21 South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw (SYB) ICS was part of an HEE programme to grow the supply of nursing, 
midwives and AHPs through more high-quality clinical placements. At the same time HEE and NHSE/I introduced 
programmes to enhance and expand access to placements including Clinical Placement Expansion and Enabling 
Effective Learning Environments funding.

The SYB ICS ‘place based approach’ combined these programmes under a single governance structure that included 
HEE, placement providers and universities - Learning Environment and Placement (LEAP). Working together enabled 
them to transcend local complexities to ensure consistency in the development and expansion of preregistration 
practice education.

Despite the demands of the pandemic, SYB introduced placement initiatives and new roles, providing support at 
place level and helping organisations to achieve the coordination and expansion of placements. These activities 
included introducing coaching/ratio models, adapting and adopting digital learning and education, wider use of 
alternative placement experiences such as leadership, blended learning experiences which brought together the 
practice and simulated environment and the expansion of non-NHS placements through a lead partnership and long 
arm supervision arrangements. 

This enabled the restoration of placements and introduced over 20 new placement providers. This meant local 
universities did not have to turn away eligible applicants and could welcome record numbers of nursing, midwifery 
and AHP students. The number entering training grew by 26%. This success can be attributed to a coordinated and 
collaborative approach that enabled flexibility, supported integration, encouraged transparency, and removed barriers. 
Whilst the programme has achieved growth, it must remain dynamic and adaptable to support continued innovation. 

The success has also led to the formulation of North East and Yorkshire Regional Placement Strategy to continue  
and share the learning. 

South West 

HEE South West has been instrumental in establishing innovative projects to address workforce challenges and 
training priorities across the region.

Clinical Endoscopy provision, for example, has been a major challenge so an Endoscopy Training Academy, initially 
at two sites, will deliver immersive training for endoscopy learners, support and train administrative staff, providing 
both additional service and training provision. Another first is establishing a multi-professional generalist school. 
The Trailblazer, developed with the Gloucester ICS and local universities, will also link to clinical education research 
opportunities with the Academic Health Science Networks (AHSN).

Welcoming and supporting international medical graduates is a priority so an extended ‘Welcome to UK practice’ 
programme has been developed. Supported by fellowships and a working group, it is helping to assist those new to 
the UK to establish themselves on training programmes and ensure they reach their full potential.

A new Faculty of Advancing Practice, part of the HEE national programme, is a further successful development.

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

Embedding advanced practitioners across all healthcare settings is vital as they are integral to the future NHS 
workforce. Initiatives include an Emergency Care ACP pilot across five sites, support for enhanced practice roles for 
74 radiographers, and a developing Reporting Radiographer Training proposal.

Partnership working has been critical to developing oral health training across our health and social care sectors. The 
South West Mouth Care Matters team worked with NHSE and PHE to develop links with local authorities to support 
oral health improvement in the care sector and some further education colleges. Targeted virtual training has been 
delivered to allied health professionals, acute and community adult nurses and care staff. The training, initially aimed 
at older people, now embraces care for individuals with learning difficulties and physical disabilities.

Raising awareness of small and vital health professions is also helping to address workforce challenges. In North 
Somerset HEE worked with podiatrists to create a story picture book that introduces children aged five to seven to 
Penny the Podiatrist, enabling them to learn about the role of podiatrists through the experience of a grandparent. 
The books have been shared with colleagues for use as part of a ready-made career toolkit for classrooms. 

London

In July 2020, a team of interprofessional healthcare specialists formed the London Transformation and Learning 
Collaborative (LTLC) critical care programme. As part of the wider London Workforce Hub, the LTLC supports 
the cross-skilling of the workforce to manage existing critical care demand, potential future demand spikes from 
COVID-19; and longer-term permanent expansion of critical care capacity. 

Many of the LTLC team delivered education and training for the London Nightingale Hospital and used this 
experience to shape the programme, combining new models of care and workforce with education and training 
needs to rapidly create an agile interprofessional workforce able to deliver care in a wide range of clinical areas. 

The LTLC has engaged over 400 stakeholders regionally and nationally to co-develop the programme, working with 
the five ICSs in the capital, as well as professional and governing bodies such as the Intensive Care Society, British 
Association of Critical Care Nurses (BACCN) and the Critical Care National Network Nurse Leads Forum (CC3N).

Together we created a microsite with over 500 multi-media education resources and we are piloting Non-Registered 
Support Staff and Registered Support Clinician Digital Skills passports before a potential national spread. We 
produced an interprofessional matrix to map skills required for different professional groups and critical care roles, 
with aligned education resources as well as a ICU orientation interactive tour for staff and are working with ICUs on 
a patients and family member version. 

Our video series addressed how to support those who experienced moral injury, which is when we believe we 
or others have been responsible for unmet moral or ethical obligations, during the pandemic and our equipment 
support matrix allows users to find approved training and support resources for specific equipment. Finally, we have 
delivered just in time training packages covering the pandemic and undertaken deep dives across six surge sites to 
support workforce redesign at regional and national levels.

South East

In collaboration with our partners and stakeholders, despite the challenge of COVID-19, we have continued to 
improve the way we educate, train, and develop our workforce, including through the newly established Regional 
People Board. 

We are developing an AHP Faculty model to provide the infrastructure that facilitates system-wide working and  
we helped launch the Kent and Medway Medical School offering a new model of patient focused medical education. 
Student, NHS staff, and GMC feedback is very positive.

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

We are involved in a virtual reality medicine and surgery training project delivering virtual 360VR cadaveric surgical 
procedures to delegates and hosting a pre-conference course for the Association of Surgeons in Training. We are 
also working with NHSE/I and the Charlie Waller Trust to implement Royal College of Nursing (RCN) endorsed online 
primary care training supporting staff carrying out physical health checks on people with serious mental illness. 

We supported Perinatal Mental Health Simulation training, co-produced with service users which won a coveted 
award for patient involvement and the new Psychological Professions Network providing a voice for the professions 
in workforce planning and excellence in practice. 

Our new Advancing Practice Faculty aims to build an advancing practice workforce of highly experienced clinicians. 
We also established a First Contact Practitioner education forum with partners and developed the Kent, Surrey, 
Sussex (KSS) Public Health Practitioner programme.

Our nursing team, with student nurses, successfully pioneered a nursing student council in the Hampshire and Isle of 
Wight ICS which we plan to expand with student councils and professional groups to ensure learner perspectives are 
integral to education and learning. We were also delighted to welcome the first student nurse on regional placement 
and we supported the Thames Valley Nurse Cadets pilot programme, which was recently shortlisted in the HSJ Value 
Awards. The programme with trusts, colleges, and universities aims to get young people into nursing. 

We have formed stronger relationships with Skills for Care, social care, and local authorities to address adult social 
care workforce challenges. We are proud of our contribution to the Adult Oral Health Oversight Group’s work on 
improving oral health in care homes. As a result, our dental team led on developing training resources for the new 
Adult Oral Health in Care Homes Toolkit. 

 
East of England 

We work with NHSE/I, PHE, social care and education providers to support systems in developing the workforce to 
make the East of England NHS a great place to train and work.

We increased fill rates in all our medical specialties, including general practice where we met our expansion targets. 
This is matched by an improved support offer to our Faculty with initiatives including virtual masterclasses and 
educator symposia. Our virtual learning platform has been widely used by specialty trainees and now hosts, amongst 
other topics, training in leadership and quality improvement. We have embraced generalism and established our 
Faculty of Advanced Practice. We are continuing to develop our approach to addressing differential attainment and 
actively sharing learning across specialties.

Our part of the 50,000 nurse increase has seen significant international recruitment, an increase of 35% in 
student nursing applications, and the establishment of a joint NHSE/I/HEE and system workforce Board to take the 
commitment forward in the coming year. We have integrated processes for demand scoping and commissioning 
intentions with ICSs/STPs and aligned with People Plan priorities with the principle of subsidiarity. To further support 
the ICSs, we and NHSE/I are working on a collective approach to strategic system discussions.

In Mental Health we have increased from 15 to 30 Mental Health Support Teams and the IAPT target of 330 was 
met. We commenced the Peer Support Worker and Supervision programme, appointed 10 accountable officers or 
responsible clinicians, established the Psychological Professions Network, and started the Clinically Led Workforce 
and Activity Redesign Programme.

Performance Analysis

Midlands

To aid recovery, we worked with NHSE/I to produce the unique Midlands Charter which outlines trusts commitment 
to prioritise the restoration of Postgraduate Medical Education which has been signed by 17 trusts to date.

Tackling health inequalities is one of our top priorities so we are well advanced with plans for a generalist programme 
giving professionals the skills to work with other agencies and tackle some of the underlying causes of ill-health.
Additionally, we are working with medical schools and universities to widen participation and ensure the professions 
reflect the population they serve.

We focused on supporting nursing in a social care setting in partnership with social care colleagues, Skills for Care 
and Directors of Adult Social Care. This started with the launch of the HEE film promoting the breadth and depth of 
opportunities for students, qualified nurses, and nursing associates. Five pilot sites are helping to grow the nursing 
associate role in social care.

The Workforce Transformation Team supports systems and leaders to collaborate on programmes and activities 
around Regional People Board priorities and HEE People Plan deliverables. The focus this year has been nursing, 
cancer and diagnostics followed by workforce supply, its on-going development as well as the future planning of 
the workforce. These events have been hugely successful with over 110 delegates joining virtually and feeding back 
positively.

We host the Genomics Education Programme (GEP) which has continued to work closely with NHSE/I’s Genomics 
Unit to support the workforce elements of the Genomic Medicine Service, including launching a joint workforce 
steering group. The GEP also continued to develop and deliver high-quality education and in the past year achieved 
15,600 course completions and 153,700 views of its learning resources.

North West

The North West (NW) People Programme is the regional implementation of the NHS People Plan, working with 
NHSE/I and the NW NHS Leadership Academy. We aim to improve population health, reduce health inequalities, 
deliver safe, effective, inclusive and compassionate care through the growth, development and support of the health 
and care workforce. We aspire to a joined-up approach to workforce, and people development and support across 
the NW.

HEE has taken the workforce supply and transformation lead across five specific workstreams Through strong 
partnership working we have succeeded, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the pandemic has forged new 
collaborative working and partnership with key stakeholders.

Our workforce supply workstream includes nursing strategy, supply strategies for apprentices, retention, and 
returners to training, as well as a plan to increase placement capacity. Our workforce transformation workstream 
includes upskilling and new ways of working, new roles, and digital transformation. HEE colleagues also supported 
other workstreams through their expertise and connections. This has been underpinned by workforce modelling and 
intelligence providing products and modelling to support understanding of the current and future workforce.
Working under the regional governance structure, our partners have focused on people priorities and had critical 
input into the NW NHS People Board. This has enabled joint problem solving, enhanced transparency, better 
coordination, and alignment as well as cross-organisation support. Above all else, we can hold one another 
accountable for improving the experience of working in the NHS for everyone.

Innovative routes to growing the workforce

Whilst HEE’s core business is supporting undergraduate and postgraduate learners to join the NHS, we also provide 
support across a wide range of other routes into the NHS, including overseas, apprenticeships, widening participation 
and volunteering. In this section we explore the work of our Global and Talent for Care teams.

The University of Keele supplied services to support HEE’s Global Unit in 2020/21 through their Faculty of Health and 
Medicine. The University of Keele now employs Professor Ian Cumming OBE, previously HEE Chief Executive 2012 
to 2020. Professor Ian Cumming chairs the NHS International Committee, chairs the Cross Arms Length Body Better 
Health Programme Advisory Board, mentors the Health Education England Global Director and supports the HEE 
contribution to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Better Health Programme.

Global Health Engagement 2020-21

HEE’s Global Engagement develops education partnerships which strengthen health systems and services here 
and overseas. We work with partners to attract, educate, and train an international health workforce to benefit 
populations around the world. 

Global Learners Programme (GLP)

The GLP is four years old offering overseas nurses employment in the NHS as part of an “earn, learn and live” 
scheme. Working with overseas governments, nurses are supported through in-country education which meet NMC 
standards, prior to joining the NHS. The programme works with 50 NHS Providers, including Acute, Community, and 
Mental Health services.

HEE played a crucial part this year towards delivering the government’s additional 50,000 nurses commitment by 
sourcing more nurses than ever before. Despite the global pandemic challenge, 900 nurses arrived in 2020-21 to 
work in the NHS. This included 180 experienced Intensive Care Nurses who were deployed during February and 
March 2021.
 
Clinical Radiology, Radiography

HEE, Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) and Apollo Imaging international pilot recruits Radiology Fellows and the 
International Recruitment Programme continues to support the Cancer Workforce Plan. The new Apollo education 
programme and RCR objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) assessment centre supports individuals to 
undertake relevant college exams to ensure they meet the needs of the NHS.

Emergency Medicine 

We continued to work with the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) to help the NHS recruit Emergency 
Medicine doctors into training programmes that develop emergency medicine skills at a range of levels to ensure the 
best mix of junior and middle grade expertise. This year 16 doctors were deployed to the East of England, with 30 
more appointed pending GMC registration, and 57 awaiting interviews.

Performance Analysis

HEE UK English Language Programme 

Working closely with NHSE/I, we invested £1.3m to help 2,043 Healthcare Support Workers (HCSWs) with overseas 
nursing qualifications improve their English language skills. This money, received largely by Black, Asian and Minority 
Ethnic HCSWs will improve communication for patients and staff in 105 NHS Trusts, and help more HCSWs reach the 
English language level required to join the UK NMC Register.

HSCWs have worked tirelessly throughout COVID-19 but do not always receive the thanks and recognition they 
deserve. This programme acknowledges HCSWs contribution whilst improving ward level communications and 
quality of care.

Technical Collaboration to Strengthen Health Systems 
 
HEE continued to strengthen technical collaboration through partnerships which build capacity and benefit the NHS 
and the health systems of partner countries. This year we advised the Kyrgyzstan Ministry of Health on medical 
education reform with the World Health Organisation (WHO). We also worked with the West Bengal health system 
on re-designing blending learning packages for mental health nurse communication programmes.

Our Technical Collaboration Unit also delivered six workshops on the clinical management of COVID-19 within 
Ghana’s mental health system with the East London NHS Foundation Trust and worked with the UK Defence Medical 
Service to support the COVID-19 response in Bangladesh.

HEE has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Consortium of Thai Medical Schools to 
create a Managed Education Partnership (MEP) for Medical Fellows which will exchange its first cohorts in 2021-
22. The HEE/PHE hosted ‘NHS Joint Unit’ delivered technical and quality improvement support to the Foreign, 
Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) ‘Better Health’ Programme - helping it to an ‘A’ rating in FCDOs’ 
internal evaluation.

International Placements and Learning to support NHS workforce development 

The pandemic demonstrated the NHS needs global health workers to support strong, resilient health systems. 
Normalising and increasing global learning opportunities for staff will only enhance this. Whilst traditional exchange 
programmes have been limited by the pandemic, new virtual exchange programmes have begun and will be 
evaluated over the year ahead. 

Talent for Care

Talent for Care supports our apprenticeship, volunteering and widening participation work.



39. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships are included in the People Plan and LTP and are a HEE priority. With 4.5% of our own staff made
up of apprentices, more than any other DHSC arms-length body, we lead by example and have extensively promoted 
apprenticeships to potential NHS recruits.

The NHS pays £200 million annually in apprenticeship levy, which we help the NHS use to create employment 
opportunities and grow the workforce. This year spent more of that levy with approximately twenty thousand 
apprentices starting in the NHS. We help improve literacy, IT, numeracy, and functional skills qualifications, which are 
essential to all apprenticeships.

Our apprenticeship work has continued to promote and develop apprenticeships with over 85 apprenticeship 
standards now available in health and science. This year we helped employers and apprentices by supporting 
apprentices with End Point Assessment (EPA) flexibility to stay on their programme during the pandemic and are now 
ensuring apprenticeships feature strongly in recovery planning. Health and other public sector areas have the highest 
apprentice retention rates following the pandemic.

The NHS is expected to deliver around one-third of the public sector apprenticeship target, with around 28,000 
annually. Talent for Care has supported at system and organisation level towards the 50,000 nurses growth target 
through the Registered Nurse Degree Apprenticeship (RNDA). The apprenticeship workstream will increase RNDA 
uptake by 2,000 starts.

The apprentices team also provided support for system-wide procurement, levy transfers for providers, and levy 
transfer partnering with other industries for primary and social care apprenticeships. We grew our EPA collaboration 
with universities, national providers and the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) - the first of its kind - to 
ensure quality, best practice and EPA access for clinical apprenticeships as well as aligning EPAs for regulated roles 
with Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) policy changes.

On top of this, over 11,000 learners from 130 employers used our functional skills tool to support staff with 
numeracy, literacy and ICT skills and we ran multiple support sessions supporting employers in Skills for Life planning. 
Over 300 learners from 20 employers have registered for their functional skills exams before the end of the academic 
year, a number that is likely to rise significantly.

Our national English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) strategy is informed by our recently refreshed practice 
group, comprised of practitioners, teachers, ESOL speakers and other colleagues. We are especially proud of our 
downloadable Top Tips - compiled by practice group member Iolanda Pedrosa, with 50 employers already attending 
webinars as interest grows.

We also commission access to a tool called ENIC from the UK National Information Centre for the recognition and 
evaluation of international qualifications and skills allowing employers to check the UK equivalence of overseas 
qualifications. Over 400 health and social care staff have progressed their career as a result. 

Widening Access and Participation 

Giving opportunities to those from non-traditional backgrounds helps the NHS maximise its access to talent, 
improves disadvantaged communities and reduces inequalities in health by making the workforce better reflect those 
it is designed to serve.

The Talent for Care team’s Step into Work programme supported over 300 unemployed people into health and social 
care roles and now has a fast-track route as a direct response to the economic impact of the pandemic. Through
our partnership with the Careers Enterprise Company, we have 16 Cornerstone Employers and over 50 Enterprise 
Advisors all actively supporting schools and colleges with careers provision.



40. Health Education England - Annual Report and Accounts 2020-21

Performance Report

Performance Analysis

Our widening access work includes growing professional entry from under-represented areas and marginalised 
groups through diverse partners and initiatives. Future Quest targets the South East, Sutton Trust and the Social 
Mobility Foundation targets the North West, North East and the Midlands, whilst the Medical School Council targets 
the South West, South East, London, East of England, the Midlands and the North West.

Results include the Medical Schools Council Access to Medicine programme recruiting 736 students to summer 
schools, 165 more than the target, with 11 from local authority care and 38 young carers. The Social Mobility 
Foundation Aspiring Professionals Programme: Medical’s cohort was 22% BAME, 26% eligible for free school meals, 
and 28% living in the worst performing 50% of local authorities - the programme achieved 74% conversion into 
medicine and the professions. The Sutton Trust’s Pathway to Medicine programme’s five cohorts showed 82% were 
accepted into university with 52% going on to study medicine or related discipline, giving a return on investment of 
£17.70 for every £1 invested in the programme. Future Quest’s Routes into Medicine and the Professions started its 
first cohorts in 2020.

Volunteering 

Volunteering has been central to the pandemic response with over 750,000 people volunteering in the NHS. HEE’s 
programmes have been recognised at national and international level for training, upskilling, and supporting volunteers.

This year we have created a new national volunteering team and achievements include 5,500 NHS Ambassadors inspiring 
future generations to work in the NHS through 4,000 invitations to Inspiring the Future and Primary Futures events. 
We also radically and rapidly tailored our Volunteer Learning Programme e-Learning content to support volunteers 
during the pandemic and created new content to highlight national NHS Responder volunteer roles and duties.

We also worked with 22 vanguard pilot sites analysing the impact of volunteer education and supported a Skills for 
Justice Accredited national Volunteering Certificate and badge. 

Corporate Social Responsibility 

HEE’s primary focus is to support the NHS in having the workforce it needs to provide world class care for all, free at 
the point of need. Nonetheless, as a public sector body, HEE is keen to support and promote good causes beyond its 
statutory responsibilities and particularly those that our colleagues are passionate about.

HEE colleagues continue promoting, supporting, and celebrating a wide range of charities and causes. This was 
particularly difficult due to the pandemic, but it has not stopped colleagues from being creative and inventive, giving 
their time and raising thousands of pounds for charities.

We continue via the Learning and Development Policy to encourage all HEE colleagues to set aside up to 5 days each 
year to aid their personal development and make a difference to their local communities. Our ‘ABCDE’ days allow 
colleagues to ‘do their bit’ by volunteering for a charity of their choice for a day in which they would usually be at work.

We are extremely proud of our colleague’s philanthropic work and continually celebrate and promote these through 
internal communications. Many colleagues have made strong connections not only with local charities but have also 
used this to keep in touch with their colleagues in a social and wellbeing setting throughout the pandemic.

Respect for Human Rights

Over and above our statutory responsibilities and in accordance with the principles of the NHS Constitution, we are 
committed to respecting and promoting the human rights of all NHS staff, st
