STP Monthly Memo (January
2023)
The STP Monthly Memo includes the latest
programme updates, events and key resources for
STP trainees and training officers.

Message from your STP Training
Programme Directors

Jane Lynch and Aarti Makan

This month’s message is from Jane Lynch.

Welcome to the first STP memo of 2023! January can be a gloomy
time of year, when the excitement of the holiday season is over
and the days are still short. The start to 2023 is likely to be
challenging, particularly for those working in an extremely busy
healthcare environment. Monday 16th January has sometimes
been dubbed ‘Blue Monday’. I much prefer the term used by the
Samaritans ‘Brew Monday’, making it a positive day for people to
reach out to friends, family and colleagues over a cup of tea, to
check they are feeling OK. Low mood and poor mental health are
of course not restricted to a single day so it’s important to do this
throughout the year.

My Top Tips to improve health and wellbeing:

Get outdoors – as sunlight is likely to be in short supply, make
sure you get outside when possible. Being in nature can be
particularly helpful. I love to get out for a walk when I can –
preferably in the mountains or beside the coast but just
walking around my local park can calm my mind and raise my
mood.

Exercise – walking, running, cycling, playing sports – whatever
makes you happy!

Eat healthily – balancing cravings for carbohydrates with plenty
of fresh fruit and vegetables.

Get enough sleep – mindfulness techniques can help you relax.

Talk to friends and family – talking to others can help you cope
with feeling low.

Look forward – I always try and have a few events planned in
my diary – catching up with friends, days out or a treat
following submitting an assignment can really help to keep
motivated.

Seek help when needed – remember to check out our support
pages on the website, which include advice, blogs by previous
trainees and links to support services.

Update on plans to introduce external assessment
in the workplace

In November we outlined our intention to explore the
introduction of a lightweight amount of external assessment of
workplace-based assessment (OCEs, DOPS and CBDs) for trainees
on the new curricula.

In consultation events since then, we have received valuable and
detailed feedback from trainers about this proposal. Trainers have

told us that overall they are in favour of the proposals but that
they have concerns about their logistical feasibility.

In response to the concerns raised we have decided to use the
early months of this year to test out some revised approaches to
external assessment that are very sensitive to the concerns we
have received. A finished model of external assessment is
therefore unlikely to be ready to begin in the Autumn of 2023.
We would rather pilot and learn than drop an untested proposal
on to trainees and trainers. We still plan for external assessment
to form part of the assessment strategy for trainees in the 2022
cohort.

We are looking for volunteers to help us to test out some of our
revised proposals. Follow the link below to find out more.

Protecting sensitive information in OneFile

We have published some new guidance about how trainees
should protect and exclude patient identifiable information in
their submissions on OneFile. This includes guidance about
anonymisation, patient consent and fully removing and redacting
(rather than just hiding) sensitive information from files
uploaded.

information in OneFile (Link:

Managing your trainees

We have created a section on our website providing answers 
about issues ranging from study leave to funding.

This month’s featured FAQ is:

Q – Who do trainees speak to when they are having problems
with training?

A – The trainee must always speak first to their training officer
about any problems with training. The School’s Training
Programme Directors will support training officers if they need
further advice.
