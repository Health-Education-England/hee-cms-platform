ETP Monthly Memo
(January 2023)
The ETP Monthly Memo includes the latest
programme updates, events and key resources for
ETP trainees and training officers.

As we near the completion date for the 2021 cohort, please see
the important information regarding this below.

January can be a gloomy time of year, when the excitement of
the holiday season is over and the days are still short. The start
to 2023 is likely to be challenging, particularly for those working
in an extremely busy healthcare environment. Monday 16th
January has sometimes been dubbed ‘Blue Monday’. I much
prefer the term used by the Samaritans ‘Brew Monday’, making
it a positive day for people to reach out to friends, family and
colleagues over a cup of tea, to check they are feeling OK. Low
mood and poor mental health are of course not restricted to a
single day so it’s important to do this throughout the year.

My Top Tips to improve health and wellbeing:

Get outdoors – as sunlight is likely to be in short supply, make
sure you get outside when possible. Being in nature can be
particularly helpful. I love to get out for a walk when I can –
preferably in the mountains or beside the coast but just
walking around my local park can calm my mind and raise my
mood.

Exercise – walking, running, cycling, playing sports – whatever
makes you happy!

Eat healthily – balancing cravings for carbohydrates with
plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.

Get enough sleep – mindfulness techniques can help you
relax.

Talk to friends and family – talking to others can help you
cope with feeling low.

Look forward – I always try and have a few events planned in
my diary – catching up with friends, days out or a treat
following submitting an assignment can really help to keep
motivated.

Seek help when needed – remember to check out our support
pages on the website, which include advice, blogs by previous
trainees and links to support services.

Training frequently asked questions
We are in the process of updating our ETP website and have
included the following new FAQs.

BSE regional webinars
The Society’s annual programme of events and educational
meetings offers ongoing learning, professional development
and  opportunities to network and collaborate with others in
the echocardiography field.

Current events listings include:

1. The first regional meeting of 2023 will be held on 9th

2. Accreditation clinics: The accreditation clinic is a great
opportunity to meet with the accreditation team to discuss

How much study leave will I receive? Is this allowance
valid just until the academic component is complete or
until the end of the programme?

When I have completed the programme, can I apply for
statutory registration?

I have a candidate with a 2:2 Honours degree in a
suitable scientific discipline who has worked in my
Cardiac department for 5 years, can they apply to the
programme?

Review of the ETP Curriculum
We’re embracing the new year with a new start and beginning a
review of the ETP curriculum.

The ETP began in 2020 and we were thrilled to see the first
trainees complete the programme last summer and enter
practice, applying their skills to benefit patients. With the third
cohort under way, now is the time to learn from all your
experiences both delivering and following the programme to
make sure the curriculum is fit for purpose.

The first step of the review process is to gather feedback from
everyone involved in the programme. We want to hear your
thoughts on the curriculum. Is it meeting your needs? Where it
could be improved? We’ll then appoint a Lead Editor who will
provide the scientific leadership for the review. The Lead Editor
will work with us at the School to navigate the review process
and establish a Curriculum Review Group. The group will then
review your feedback and make decisions on the future
direction for the curriculum. We’ll keep in touch to let you know
how we’re getting on.

There are a number of ways you can get involved:

1. Express your interest.

Let us know you’d like to be involved and how, from driving the
process as Lead Editor to sitting on the Curriculum Review
Group and providing your feedback. Expressions of interest are
open until the end of January.

Click here to express your interest (Link:
https://healtheducationyh.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/etp-review-eoi).

2. Provide feedback on the curriculum.

The information you provide will be used by the Curriculum
Review Group to review and redevelop the curriculum. We’d be
particularly pleased to hear views from graduates of the
programme. Please do share the survey with anyone you think
would want to give feedback. The survey is available until the
end of February.
